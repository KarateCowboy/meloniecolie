the new rings of power will star liam hemsworth as galadriel.
I would love to see a well done  respectful tolkien series. that would be awesome. so yeah  if amazon erases season one  admits they messed up and starts over  then maybe  distant maybe   perhaps  a small chance  but not zero  we could get a decent series that respects the lore.
make galadriel tall again!make galadriel psychic again!make galadriel a mage again!make galadriel great again!
amazon still hasn t apologized for the gaslighting  emotional manipulation  name-calling  shilling  and deleting of negative reviews. no chance in hell Im going to watch their  reboot .
gandalf arrived during the third age to the grey havens via ship along with radagast and saruman. cirdan the elf recognized that he  gandalf  had a major role to play  and secretly gave him the red ring of fire. he didn t fall out of the sky. sauron was captured after the numenorians laid siege to mordor and was taken back to numenor where he manipulated them into trespassing against valinor  causing their utter destruction  except for a very few. they really could have used the same actors to make a series about the nazgul before they fell under sauron s evil influence. that would have been interesting and wouldn t have gone so badly against the canon. idiots were hired to make this atrocious show.
if it is not a 100  hard reboot  and if peter jackson is not involved  we do not want it
I want the  ex  producers to give out an apology for season 1 and calling fans patently evil
translation of rumor  people are tired of slipping on the blood and tripping over all the heads rolling across the floor at amazon studios. a full-on hard reboot is the only change I will accept  and  even then  it had better be dang good this time around!
reboot or no  Im still waiting on an apology  both for that betrayal of tolkien s works and for the gaslighting that they used to try to defend that trash.if we the fans dont publicly get one  if tom shippy doesnt publicly get one  and if they dont get down on their knees and publicly beg peter jackson and the original weta crew to take advisor rolls with veto power on such a project  then nothing will be forgiven or forgotten. amazon has one last chance  and a lot of ass-kissing to do.no genuine apologies  no forgiveness.no lotr show  acceptable  if this is what they re going to produce.
its nice to see damage control in action!
I can believe the second season would be a radical shift in tone  attitude  focus and quality but still technically be a follow on from the first season.  Ivery much doubt they d literally start again though.
its definitely too little too late for me. from all that I heard and saw before the show premiered  itseemed to me they were gonna tell their own story  not tolkien s. I didn t even bother watching it  and from what Ive heard about it after it premiered  its even worse than I feared. they re not just telling their own story with tolkien s characters  they re telling their own story with their own characters  they re just using tolkien s names. its not tolkien  Ivery much doubt it will ever be tolkien  and so I have no interest in this pisspoor fanfiction of a show
if this is true then this reboot will have to be the fastest one ever made.
your channel is growing quickly  keep it up mel!
actually rebooting it   starting again is probably the only way I d give it another chance. there is no way to salvage the current mess  even if they pulled in the best writers   showrunners in the world rop has run so far off the rails there is no way back.if amazon came out and said  look we know it was arwful  we are really sorry   we are going to start again and do it properly this time I would have a lot of respect for that. cant see it happenning but wouldn t that be nice
I will believe it when I see it. I doubt they will reboot it.  this is probably just a trick to get people to watch the next season.  these people always double down rather then admit their faults.
this is so funny!!! sounds like the original idea was going to be better than what we got. gary from nerdrotic really knows his stuff. youre right we good products that respect source material. still cant believe she hulk is up for an award  unless it was awarded for  complete waist of time award.  love the video melonie. cool shirt by the way. have fun today melonie. praying for ya.
gee cant wait to see more of halbrand as sauron. pretty boy  tossled hair  cheeky dimples  skinny hips  no sense of history or menace. just like I always imagined sauron to be.
I am not sure how many talented producers and showrunners will want their named attached to this thing at this point. its a shame
the rop series is the reason Im actually going to start talking about the franchises I love and am passionate about myself because I can no longer sit and watch them butcher all of it.. it was the last straw for me. keep it up melonie! love listening to you talking about these things!
dude
2022 will finally be his year!
epic
man-power! stunning and brave!
..
well done sir
with extra man spreading pr shots
lmao
zinga!!
or frusk of g4
they dont understand what they did wrong. Im quite sure they actually believe that  some trolls  wrecked their masterpiece. there s no fixing this as the confusion goes right to the top of the food chain. think about how amazon treats its staff...total contempt for human life  so how could a company like that be any good at entertaining people if they re in the driver s seat.
we dont need tv!! listen to the audio books if you  dont want to read
you are naive if youreally think they get it. they will change things  but its still going to have the issue that the writers and directors dont like or understand tolkien.
@high caliber  actors standing around  saying  there text and not talking to each other... you mean they are so daft they do not see it or did Imiss some sort of  that is the new cinema art
not possible in 2022. its a miracle we have jackson s lotr
I think that arnold schwarzenegger   present day  with beard  might be a better fit.
wot  with the beard as well  !!  ahem
wesley snipes
@soldsoul4vb  he s not enough of an inclusive victim tho  perfect. I appreciate the blade movies more now.
it would probably be better than the absolute drivel of season 1.
wait  thats not liam playing her now !  I gotta get new contacts...
no way bro  terry crew or nothing
woman now becomes a man
thats funny
why did this make me laugh so much haha
there is no curse in elvish  entish or the tongues of men for such treachery.
as long as scarlett johansson plays gandalf  I will be fine with this choice.

at this point that would be better than the wooden plank we got.
that would be a definite improvement
@robint h-d.e.s  holy fuck  I wouldn t even try lol
omg
dude you win the internet today
I would actually watch it then. throw terry crews in as sauron and this show would be salvageable.
dennis rodman  with a blond wig.
hahaha  thatsounds weirdly familiar. amazon takes notes from netflix  huh  wont save them as it wont save netflix either.
he ll be a transexual character  just to check all the boxes .
I thought you said liam neason! lol. there are a couple of decent actors that just need the direction to change and hire myself to change it.
@c. krueger  but that what modern women strive to be !!- amazon  probably
if I am not wrong she is a mage
@rupak ranjan pradhan  she is but somehow she insisted on figthing with a sword in the show  I guess you cant showcase a strong and powerful female lead with just glowing hands and magic tricks  nothing screams power like a good old iron sword slicing trough orcs
@anthony mukoko  if I want to see a sword I would rether watch anime it way more entertaining then this bs
@anthony mukoko  they clearly dont respect token
mgga
@rupak ranjan pradhan  youre not wrong  but the show runners are.
no need. we root for sauron now.
@rupak ranjan pradhan  is that a southpark reference
@aice336  it is my man
100  I refuse to watch anything they create
and they never will
a very valid point. thanks for reminding us all of the depraved evils of amazon.
this
so you ve cancelled amazon prime  right
@zhitfr m zhinol   never had it...
rite!!! they dont deserve any second chances after not doubling but tripling down
I watch it all for free  I am okay with watching a reboot as long as its better than the shit they gave us
and they never will  because they hate you. rings of power just gave them the chance to prove it
@c. krueger  Ive not seen it  but the characters dont look right.
grok effer there is a problem with a series about the nazgul  with two exceptions there is literally nothing known about who they where other than the fact that all of them where human kings. the two exceptions are of course the witch king of angmar and kamul the easterling. the rest  no information at all.ps  dont forget the two blue wizards. just because they re only mentioned once and tolkien never mentioned their names or where they went doesnt mean they dont exist.
@h h  the blue wizards arrived during the second age and traveled into the east. the kings and chieftains that became the nazgul would have been scattered across the areas thatsauron had influence over  which was considerable in the east and south. it wouldn t have been canon inasmuch as tolkien having written it  but it wouldn t have been a direct violation  written amateurishly  as the current show appears to be. the current show doesnt seem to have anything to do with the rings of power so far  even though thats the title of the series. celebrimbor looks clownish and durin seems to lack serious- mindedness.
@moric  honestly  I got the impression that they were actually trying to be offensive to the actual fans of tolkien s works.
@grok effer  that is maybe here the case. the rumor said that the decision to attack the fans had come from the  top .
@moric  its not a good business model. its very divisive and triggers a lot of hostility.
@c. krueger  na  cant live with black elves and dwarves. the elves are a race. the dwarves are a race. how come we dont have black and asian orcs   enough with this woke nonsense.
good show would have been one about talion from the shadow of mordor games. yes it ain t canon but so isn t the amazon show so why not give some good non canon shit instead
@matthias  that would be like rooting for an asteroid to come and...oh.
galadriel is freaking awesone in the books but amazon retcon her.
she is not a mage. but I agree with you
@keila beatriz  if you were to try to create her in dnd  you would likely have to go with a sorcerer  so maybe not a mage but close enough.
preach!
their entire studio is just bad... everything from production  directing  creative process  acting  plot  dialogue  world building is just downright bad... even cgI   which gets praised   I do not want to watch something so heavily contrasted  edited   hyperrealistic  to the point it looks washed out and fake.. lotr used real props and designs then integrated cgI which made things look magical yet real. orcs looked real as they could be.
@justin n  I also want a public announcement that they were fools to hire two nobodies without credentials jsut cause they got jjs coffee  Imean  worked at bad robot. well never get it though.
so far tolkien fans are still officially considered  patently evil .
never forget.
facts the manipulation was crazy
sauron should have been the main protagonist with celebrimbor with the elves trying to fix middle earth after the war of wrath and actually having sauron contemplating wether to repent or not than slowly he will slide to his evil ways and have cate blatshett as galadriel again ffs sack this feminist gayladriel to whatever trash she came from maybe also a bit about the dwarves aswell to get a better idea about the hatred of elves and dwarves numenor should have only appeared after sauron war with the elves Imean thats pretty clear also this gandalf and halffoots are to be binned aswell with the black elves and this while woke nonsense
and yet  you ll watch it.
@thedarkemissary  unlikely. a lot of people checked out at most the first episode. I personally stopped keeping track of it except through reviews of people watching it purely for reviewing purposes  which nets them clicks .
@thedarkemissary  nope
although peter jackson s hobbit trilogy was very awful. his lotr movies do not deserve to have the hobbit trilogy   rings of power associated with them.
@tahlia nerds out  hobbit wasn t even that bad. I would watch itseveral times over before watching trash of power even once.
@thedarkemissary  I didn t watch a single minute of the show via prime.I did watch all the youtubers ripping it a new ahole  and loved every minute of that.
@malifica jones  whatever gets you going.
youreally love the hobbit trilogy that much
be careful though the Lord of the rings was excellent but the hobbit trilogy was not.  kind of like the original star wars trilogy and the blasphemy known as the prequels.  will peter jackson make the show better for sure but I was let down by the hobbit trilogy.  great writing takes time and is something you cannot rush.  you dont have to be george rr martin slow but you want to lead with a great premise and good character arcs.  enough with the fan service and tell us a story about the world that is captivating like the fall of 1 of the nine or even all 9 great kings shit that alone was a better premise than the pile of shit they came up with
you wont get one
id also like a public announcement that they were idiots for hiring failed wannabe screenwriters who probably only got jjs coffee while at bad robot.
they had all that diversity shit in the story to begin with if they would have stuck with the story tolken told.  focus on the middle eastern people why they sided with sauron did they get screwed over by gondor.  I swear they make this shitso much more complicated than it needs to be. give us a new story within the context of the big overall story.  it doesnt have to be world changing race swapping.  the people who produce this shit dont stop to think does this make sense within the story that was already laid out.  I think that is why andor is doing well because it doesnt screwup the timeline and story of what is already known.  they had an opportunity to make something cool about the 2nd age and royally screwed the pouch.
I doubt the reboot would be any good if amazon fails to purchase the rest of the rights adaptation of the entire silmarillion and not just some of the notes or appendices  because thats the root of the problem with this show. they thought they could get away just with the brand recognition without actually telling the story itself. does anybody know if the tolkien estate require specific conditions to sell the rights adaptation or did they just flat out refuse to sell the rights to the silmarillion
imagine being an amazon consoooomer
trust me.  they should just call itseason 2 and have sauron wake up from the nightmare that was season 1. I d actually forgive and forget season 1 if they do that.
a reboot and a very public apology for their smear campaign against the fans.
you gonna give money to the people who called you racist misogynists  not a great plan...
.
@bart sullivan  yes  you ve got two big giant swathes of land ripe for stories  harad and rh n
@diogenes dworkinson  consoomers gonna consoom.
I disagree with demanding pj. as good as the lotr trilogy was  the hobbit  which is a wildly different kind of story  movies seemed like lotr 0.5  and another series would be like the lotr movies yet again  I guess. I d pay a decent amount of money to see guillermo del toro s vision for the hobbit  for example. maybe he could take over this series  that would be great  imo!
@bart sullivan  the full story of the hobbit trilogy has to be told.  peter jackson didn t have much to do with the creation  planning  or production of the hobbit.  that was del toro.  jackson came in midstream  after del toro dropped out.
@thedarkemissary  nah. we will look on youtube for more videos making fun of this shit.
I would prefer not to have peter jackson involved. the hobbit movies are garbage  and yes that isn t entirely his fault but he deserves some amount of blame. I want to see other creators who share his respect for tolkien have a chance to show us their vision of middle-earth.
I dont think it has to be pj  but he s probably got the beat chance
oh please just shut up about jackson already.studio problems or not the hobbit trilogy was a complete mess and nothing jackson has done since lotr really hit right.I wont call him a one hit wonder  because I really loved the frighteners. its basically a halloween staple for me.that being said his best days as a director are in the rearview mirror and then some.the best thing he s done since lotr was being a producer on district 9.guuillermo del toro could make a middle earth film no problem with proper support from a studio.he just didn t get it from new line   warner bros.even without gdt there are so many good directors out there that obstinately obsessing over pj s one shining triumph is just unproductive in the long run.
@tahlia nerds out   his lotr movies do not deserve to have the hobbit trilogy nobody forced jackson to make the hobbit - quite the opposite in fact.
I d be fine if peter jackson wasn t involved if it was still otherwise good
@mountain nomad vfx  I never said anyone did. I was saying that his lotr movies were so good that I was surprised find that his hobbit movies were so bad. Im confused as to why you thought I was saying thatsomeone forced him to make the hobbit movies. I dont think whatever jackson touches is gold. there were small things I disliked about his lotr trilogy  but in those movies itseemed like he really tried to adapt the series with respect. from here on I rant about the hobbit movies. Im not mad at you  I just really really dislike the hobbit trilogy  partially because the trailer with the dwarves singing in bilbo s home was so faithful to the book and so well-executed. so my dislike toward these movies is increased by disappointment of what could have been.okay  warning done. I will be ranting about jackson s hobbit now.in jackson s hobbit  bilbo was often sidelined in his own story in order to focus on the dwarves  partially because so much padding was needed to make the original story into a trilogy. the dwarf-elf romance was particularly awful. it was contrived and unnecessary. besides distracting from bilbo s story  no compelling reason as to why these two individuals would come together in a relationship. it felt really like the characters had just said  youre hot  Im hot  lets be hot together   and thats it. the two of them never built their relationship beyond that point and the attempt to make it feel like this great love story as after he dies was unconvincing. it was very poorly written.I was really excited about seeing the movie since the trailer was so good and so disappointed when I actually watched. I dislike the hobbit movies so much that I refused to waste my money watching the 3rd one in the theater and Ive only been able to watch it in segments since. its like jackson got drunk on the success of his previous trilogy that he decided to stretch the much smaller hobbit book into a trilogy as well. its like he believed that anything he touched in the regards to middle earth would be gold. Im not someone who believes that peter jackson would automatically another good movie in tolkien s universe. his lotr is so much better than his hobbit and amazon s rings of power. I personally dont want to see rings of power even if they were to choose to involve jackson in a hard reboot. I was disillusioned from the belief that he had the deep love of the source material when he butchered the hobbit. I dont know that his version of rings of power would be so very much better. I d rather just enjoy tolkien s source material.
at this point they should just cancel it  take all the budget they still have for it  and put it into a new project entirely. they will keep losing money with this. there is no way their reboot could be good enough to beat all the other shows. to a point were they make serious profit. its not gonna happen. learn  and move on.
@vla1ne   Im sure its better than rings of power  but it would be hard not to be. I have a rant about the hobbit trilogy in a different comment in this thread  so I ll try to tone this one down a bit.   note  Im so sorry this comment is so long  Im the worst when it comes to that. Imean to keep things short  but then I have so many thoughts that I end up writing a term paper in the comments.okay   now my way-too-long comment  sorry .at least the hobbit was focused on story instead of checking off boxes. it was just a really bad idea to make it a trilogy and the way the story was expanded upon was just awful. I would have liked it a lot better as a single movie  maybe 2  bilbo rescuing the dwarves was a big deal and a huge part of his character arc and there was so much other stuff going on at that time that bilbo kind of got overshadowed in his own story. the big mistake made was to focus too much on the dwarves  to the detriment of bilbo.a 2 movie format might well have worked. movie 1 could have gone up to the point where the company separated from beorn and gandalf. now they are on their own  no gandalf to guide and aid them.the 2nd movie then would have focused on bilbo growing into a hero. oh  and that ridiculous dwarf-elf romance would be cut and so would legolas. the 2nd movie would be bilbo s time to shine without unnecessary   non-canonical distractions. the casting was good and the moments thatstuck with the book and focused on bilbo were excellent. I loved everything while they were still at bag end. and bilbo s interactions with smaug were great! I wish that jackson and his writers could have just cut the fat and focused on the real story  when they did  they showed how amazing the hobbit had the potential to be. the main reason I dislike the hobbitso much is that it was originally my favorite tolkien book and the trailer of the dwarves singing at bag end gave me chills. I knew the hobbit was going to be amazing  and then it wasn t  except in a few scenes.  so very disappointing.Ive never had any such hopes for rings of power  though  it looked like a dumpster fire from the beginning. when it turned out to be awful  it didn t bother me quite as much as the hobbit because I never expected anything better of it. as much as I d like the creative team behind rings of power to do a real reboot  Im not sure it would make much of a difference unless they get people who actually care about the source materials on the creative team and give them the power to actually  influence how the reboot is crafted. I d be shocked if they did so  though  too many creative teams seem to hold real disdain for the fans of the work they re making a visual reality. but I agree with you insofar that I would rather put up with watching the hobbit trilogy than watch the rings of power. at least the hobbit trilogy would give me the scenes in bag end and bilbo and smaug s battle of wits. oh  I almost forgot  the riddle scene with bilbo and gollum is pretty good too. when the hobbit actually focuses on  y know the hobbit   it is pretty good. not up to the standards of jackson s lotr  but much better than having to watch jerk galadriel in rings of power. thanks for reminding me of the few scenes in the hobbit that I enjoyed.
@a person  the hobbit movies were the product of guillermo del toro.  jackson didn t take the project until it was half way through.
@marcus aurelius  right but they scrapped every bit of the pre-production that guillermo del toro had worked on  so his movie would have been completely different from what we got. so the trainwreck is partly jackson s fault  partly the fault of studio execs who demanded another epic nine-hour action trilogy and didn t give jackson the production time necessary to make a good film.
how do you fumble a billion dollar story thats literally.......already written lmao
@a person  wrong.  youre lying.
@marcus aurelius  thats a melodramatic accusation for this kind of a conversation. maybe you think Im mistaken but I dont think so. watch the lindsay ellis video essays on the subject  she goes into a lot of detail.
@tahlia nerds out  exactly. the hobbit was a movie series made by people who truly cared about the material  but fell short of the goal. the movies weren t great  but they were good enough that you could reasonably see where they fell short  as you have just elaborated  and it can be forgiven  to an extent  because it was an honest attempt that merely wasn t good enough.trash of power  is a show made by people who basically hate the source material  and arguably went out of their way to screw up every aspect of what they could get their paws on. they didn t just fail  they never tried in the first place  or arguably  tried as hard as they could to bastardize everything they could get a hand on .
nice!
@vla1ne   when it comes to the hobbit peter jackson wanted to wait a few more years to lay the groundwork but the bigwigs said no they wanted it now so they got someone else to do it which is why we got cgI orcs instead of actors in practical get up and also why a good majority of the action in the movie was also cgi. the dude left production leaving it half finished so they called peter jackson in to finish the movies at the last minute.
@brilicus gaming  didn t know that  and it makes even more sense under that light.
jackson isn t mandatory. what is mandatory is a team of people that respect and enjoy tolkien s works.there are many histories you cantell in this universe and I hope one day we will see new movie series that provide us content worth watching
I dont watch
@mountain nomad vfx  pj didn t have just one  shining triumph  - his ww1 documentary  they shall not grow old  is superb and his beatles documentary  get back  is excellent.
yet Christopher tolkien hated the peter jackson films ... I dont. but its quite something how so many pj fans ignore how peter turned the courageous  noble frodo of the book into a doe-eyed damsel in distress who is always falling over and needing sam to bail him out.  book frodo needs sam s help  of course  but book frodo is also stronger and braver.  then there are the character assassinations of faramir and denethor.  as great as the lotr films are  these are their abiding flaws - and those flaws are not minor.
I think guillermo del toro would be good too. he rejected direction of the hobbit and I think it was because they wanted 3 movies and a bunch of added content not in the book
have you watched the hobbit  and lotr wasent that good either. so no ty to pj.
@bart sullivan  you misspelled. its sequel. not prequel.
@mountain nomad vfx  I did like his king kong movie but I think you are spot on with the rest of your post
@k h  no its prequels.  I had faith that they would be good boy was I wrong I knew the  sequels were going to suck.  big difference
@anger macfadden  lmao... true... but each one of us that drops their load increases the strain on the rest  and we were already running in the red. we are inevitable.
@olivia  exactly you can make your own heros and villains and build up to sauron lots of potential for a show if you start from the lore and not already established characters.  shilo s spider sisters from the huge one.  anything is better than what they came up with.  personally I like the route of the rise and fall of the 9 but lots of potential for a lot of different parts of that world.
there is no way for humans to reboot  return to the form of  something that was never good to begin with. it is quite literally not possible in any way at all.
nope they had their chance
@bart sullivan  if youreally think about it the only reason they dont do this is because no one is going to watch it and it will fail so they take the franchises thats popular and ruin the s    out of them thinking that people will watch it
@maggy frog  material was not their issue  its what they did with the material they had thatshows how utterly horrible it all was.their nr1 issue was writing and logical follow throughs and anchoring their story in the world of middle earth.
@maggy frog  they referenced more than enough things to make the show connected to the lore  the things they did wrong was writing worse than most 8th graders do with their celebrity selfinsert fanfics.their characters couldnt even stay consistant with their own character for 2 scenes in a row.they added things like the harfoots in a weak attempt to member berry everyone when they knew they had nothing there to build on and had to  make shit up  as you accurately said as well.but they had everything they needed to make a connected and well told story in the tolkien universe  they just dont have the skills to do it nor the will because tolkie is apparently  toxic  and his work needs to be  fixed  so its suitable for a modern audience.that is their issue  not that they didn t have the rights to things  its that they wanted to turn tolkiens world into something it never was.
@johan johansson  the stuff they referenced were all retcons because they could not make itseem like the show is consistent with what is canonical in the books  because of the lack of rights to reference actual canon for example  the whole galadriel-sauron cornball romance is the total opposite of what s canonical  like how sauron was actually scared that galadriel is one of the few individuals who can rival his power yet we get this cheesy fan-fic ship of them in the show. there is not a shred of text that remotely supports this idea that either of them even  liked  each other in any way  shape or form.and the effing numenors. omg. its all retconned.
I would love to see peter jackson given veto power  if he does nothing else   give him the power to say   this isn t tolkien  it goes in the bin. that isn t tolkien  that goes in the bin  too .
they have too much ego - they even thought they could write better than the author themselves...
@hiraghm  the big question is whether jackson would even agree to that. of course  if he did  that alone would be an amazing improvement.
@rey-rey  the sheer hubris behind thatstatement was absolutely sickening.
having pj onboard would certainly be better than nothing  but ... he already abandoned his faithfulness to the tolkien source material when he made the hobbit. those movies took waaaayy too many liberties and itshows. there were brown people in lake town  and there shouldn t have been. thorin looked more like a human  as did kilI and filI - simply because filippa boyens wanted more sexy  hunky dwarves. aidan turner  kilI  was so miscast it was jarring everytime he came in frame - because he is more elf-like that dwarf-like. further more  azog the defiler in the book was a goblin  not an orc. and dont even get me started on tauriel  and the supremely ridiculous love story between her and kilI - another one of filippa boyen s grand ideas  which pj let through when he should have put his foot down and told boyens to stfu. the hobbit movies weren t terrible  but certainly a stepping stone towards the woke  feminist mess we re seeing today. I dont think even pj is impervious to its effects. Imean...romance between an elf and a dwarf... cmon gfto. both he and boyens should have known better.
you talk about left orientated activists here... they will not admit failure non the less apologize for doing wrong.
@my2c nts   agreed. I didn t appreciate a lot of that  either. but as much as peter and filippa introduced things thatshouldn t have been there  I understood a lot of that to be studio interference  more from the studio than from them.I think those films were right at the beginning of the whole quota moment in hollywood and thats where a lot of that extra stuff came from.
if they make it right its enough as an apology  they dont need to acknowledge officially that they screwed up because everyone knows it... if they make it good imma binge and re-binge it
oh go cry about it more
tech companies and politicians have that in common  never apologise.
@littlecaeser   I know. they ll never apologize. just like they ll never admit that hannah gadsby isn t funny.
@hiraghm  the same peter jackson who assassinated the characters of faramir and denethor and turned tolkien s wise  high-minded  courageous frodo into a wide-eyed damsel in distress who needs annoying pep talks from sam to remind him what s at stake - like frodo doesnt know !  the same peter jackson who invented that abominable scene where frodo believes gollum over sam and sends sam away   ok.  but dont tell me that any of those are minor changes compared to rop  because they re not.
@ucfrounn3i8z086fbwfxngcg I find pj s adaptation of lotr to be broadly faithful to the story - certainly much more faithful than a standard hollywood approach would have been  shudder .  pj got a lot right. the films are splendid and immersive.  the hobbit films  in contrast  are mostly dire and a waste of a great cast . but some things will always remain awful.  faramir s nobility in ttt undermined.  that ridiculous scene in osgiliath where frodo actually holds out the one ring in front of a nazgul  a scene that makes the hero look deluded and stupid and that makes no sense whatsoever. why the hell would faramir have let frodo go after seeing that   the harsh  complex denethor of the book reduced to a one-note villain in the film and his tragic suicide turned into an ugly farce. the eerie grey company of oathbreakers turned into an army of green scrubbing bubbles  I dont hate this actually but it typifies pj s high fantasy approach which jars with the sense of realism tolkien maintains .   much worse is when pj has tolkien s good guys violate their high code of honour - faramir allowing his men to beat up gollum  gandalf hitting denethor  aragorn beheading the mouth of sauron.  this stuff is just downright offensive. the good does outweigh the bad. but the bad is there. as for rop  I knew it would be fanfic. itshould have been better fanfic.
yesh you effed up. this fandom has been around longer than Ive been alive. thats alot of love and dedication
roflmao
very cathartic indeed
bezos wanted his own game of thrones  he seems to be getting it  behind the scenes at amazon prime.
damage control  I d call this desperation and salty tears!
isn t season 2 scheduled for 2023
@hiraghm  2023 is too late. when youre successful like hbo with house of the dragon you can have the luxury of jumping a year. rings of power is a giant wound spilling blood everywhere  they need to fix it yesterday. if the wait this long nobody will care when it finally arrives  half of the public will have completly forgotten the show and the other will hate it even more than they do now. disney made the same mistake with tlj  they thought a reboot wasn t necessary and that they could simply wait for the storm to pass  and that failed miserably. things that age as poorly as tlj cannot go unadressed  and the same goes for rings of power.
@bigbangrafa  but isn t a season 2 of house of the dragon coming in 2024
100 000 subscribers soon!
they cant make it right. its impossible.because its not about Lord of the rings. its about virtue signaling.even shows like hotd or andor are full of crap  full of hollow dialogues  cheesy lines and filled to the core with woke agenda.
@ tienne racine  exactlyyyy same with percy jackson tv series on disney.its all zero respect to the lore and full woke weirdness.and wheel of time tv show too
@ tienne racine  exactlyyyy you spoke facts! these people dont deserve to be called writers or movie makers when they are destroying the already awesome art.its like when the teacher says to copy the answer from the board and you still get the answer wrong its honestly stupid and horrible and represents the makers of the show in a perfect way
@ tienne racine  look at the new neverland disney film coming up. its going to be that.
it would be nice. we deserve more respect.
my thoughs exactly.
yeah  he was right every thing about rop that he say even before show started.
waste
we ll find out he had been bullied  thats why he has a chip on his shoulder.
I really think they thought you tube was going to be full of shipping videos with him and galadriel.
@herstory  probably for the best since no one bought into it.
lets hope its someone that actually likes the source material and didn t think tolkien is stupid and would actually hire writers that will follow the lore instead of trying to inject modern ideals into it.
...
Im rather tired of hearing about how rop failed because of competition with hotd. I call bs on that excuse.I know lots of friends and coworkers who watched both of them every week. some of them stopped watching rop because it was bad.none of them ever said  well  a week only has 168 hours in it  there is only time to watch hotd  I dont have time to watch rop.  not once.nobody. and frankly  if you find me a person so busy that they could only watch one of those  Im sure that person watched the one getting the best reviews or best recommendations from friends and family. which  of course  was not rop. which means  even in the rare case when they re right  its only because their show is inferior to hotd.what a stupid excuse.
what do you mean  this galadriel is too short   morfydd clark identifies as tall! respect it! she also identifies as  good actor   so  clearly  she must have done an amazing job portraying the nuances and depths of galadriel. respect it! in fact  they all identify as good at their job. I respect this so fully and completely that I dont even need to watch the show  I just skip right ahead to concluding that its brilliant. it has saved me time and frustration. as I understand it  thanks to this strategy  Imay be the only tolkien fan thats not disappointed with the show.
gary is too nice  and I think he dreams every day that amazon prime will restaff and recreate the rings of power  and then with writers that do write for the movie and take time to review their writing. writers need to test there script and story against test audience or people that are expert in that world.
if this reboot actually happens this will make history! this calls for something special  Im calling it the  rings of power effect   another channel taking about this cant for the life of me remeber which one  said thatshows in the past when cgI didn t exist yet relied on the writing and the acting to do the heavy lifting and get viewers immersed in the story  they said that as much as special effects kept getting more and more advanced the quality of writing has gone down just as much  I personally think this is an exageration cause it doesnt happen in the industry as a whole but I do think movies and shows have the misguided idea that pretty cgI can make up for a bad story  rings of power exemplifies this perfectly. its the concept of  too big to fail   amazon thought the show would suceed simply because they paid for it to suceed  and not on writers obviously  who needs good writers to make a show suceed  so let rings of power be remembered as the perfect example of a show carried by its pretty visuals cause showrunners weren t interested in paying for good writers  cause this is the rings of power effect. there s a very key distinction here  if it was a small studio it would be completely understandable why they had to be stringy with their budget  but big companies like amazon or disney have no excuse.
mel mel! a reboot this early on is definitely going to tarnish the brand that amazon has tried to create. now of course the brand has been tarnished since the first trailer because a lot of these people think a reimagining of a series is what people need and want but they re only doing things for their friends and colleagues to get the likes and the twitter retweets.I feel like once people  see a movement is going strong. there s always going to be people who have something to gain politically that want to take over the throne or become a sponsor so they can have their own agendas pushed in that demographics way.
very hard to believe this  its basically impossible. it would be as much an admission of defeat as cancelling it
youre doing a great job. if they hadn t attacked the audience in numerous ways  then they might have had a chance.
Im not sure anyone in this scenario can make an original lotr story.  tolkien had decades to create and imagine his world and characters.  jackson simply illustrated that world  which was a challenge in and of itself.  so unless there is some writer out there that has been creating stories invested heavily in the lore for a while now  that content is just going to be quick filler at best.  not to mention then bringing that to life  and being a quality produced show.
they cant cancel it. apparently  they re contracted to pay for a certain number of episodes. this means that they have to course-correct and at least break even or they re the person paying for the uninsured car that he cant drive...btw  another great source of lotr commentary is just some guy. he s a huge tolkien fan.
this is so utterly hillarious..  on one of the last episodes of the midnight edge podcasts I was saying that one of the best signs to see that the new reboots and new episodes of beloved franchises are not at par with the old ones is that you could announce that you will reshoot one of those movies  be it last jedI or rings of power or dr who or star trek or picard and the fans will go  oh  okay thats probably for the best  yeah start over thats a good idea .. in contrast to the outcry and outrage you would create if you would even try to reshoot the original star wars trilogy   that would be a sacrileg  heresy  desecration an unthinkable act of vandalization  while with th new ones pretty much every fan would go   yeah that makes sense  go on..
this remake better blow me away and have the best damn story Ive ever seen. I dont see this happening  its like they cant help themselves
we need to start calling out people that make these terrible changes by name. thats the only they will be held accountable and actually make changes. if we generalize  they have a better defense to hide behind.
love your videos and channel! love to see someone so succinct in their reviews. cheers
when tolkien said thatsauron the shapeshifter took the disguise as annatar Lord of gifts  he appeared in a fair form  that definitely meant in the form of an elf!!  rings of power couldn t even get that right!
the shows that actually have gathered audience favor are lee child s jack reacher  and the terminal list  which come from more conservative authors and screenwriting  were the bulk of the story from the book is mostly left intact... next will be season 3 of jack ryan from amazon and Im expecting that to be a large success...
no writer can write above themselves  so if they want a good second season  get good writers!
I was a little down this morning  but melonies smile and laugh definitely helped
if they actually did admit they were wrong and produce something tolkien  even though Ive been more interested in the train wreck that rop was than watching another lotr movie  I would try and turn out to see it  in theaters  on opening day  and I think most people would.  for the record this would be the first movie Ive paid out of pocket to see in probably at least 10 years in theaters.  I dont really like going to the cinema  and never really did for many reasons  but I d do it to show support.like with thatsonic movie  we should reward show creators who realize that our voices matter  and our criticism might actually improve their work  and isn t just blatant racism sexism whatever.
the best thing that could happen for fans is for amazon to reboot this garbage show with experienced show runners and respect for the lore  and for it to be wildly successful and accepted by fans. keep doing what youre doing. youre a great role model for others.
if I was those writers  I would write off the entire first season as a hellish dream that the main protagonist  galadriel  for the reboot wakes up from in a cold sweat  stricken with icy terror. lol. and I d use that opening scene as the segway into the much more improved  lore accurate  epically grandiose adaptation that tolkeins work deserves. I think that would be better to do than just pretend like none of it ever happened in the second season. that would be kind of lazy writing in my opinion. I would want to try to make sense of it about why that first season shitshow was there in the first place. I would just write it off as a freaky dream with no significance whatsoever. just a random weird dream.
I was the opposite in that I watched zero minutes of either show.I had no interest in watching a prequel to the game of thrones  not after they butchered the ending. I also had no interest in watching amazon defile tolkien s work.I did enjoy watching youtubers rip apart the rings of power  and savoured the delicious schadenfreude as the show turned into a spectacular failure that humiliated all involved.
a reboot this early is the only way to save the brand thats already tarnished to hell.
fans looked past season 8 of got because hotd is awesome. its not impossible to revive something thats seemingly dead and done. it just would need to be damned good

that would be so cool if they went with something like that
@rebekah hobbs  lmao thank you. glad to see someone in this comment section really likes the idea  amazon should hire me as their writer. I d save them from their own stupidity
amazon had one chance to make a good first impression.  they already blew it!
a reboot will be the best thing for the fans. I dont think any solution will give immediate return on investment. a second season of the rop as it is will show less and less investment. people wont care unless as you say  they perform actual magic. a reboot will not necessarily be huge and probably very confusing for people who dont tune in to streaming service drama. ultimately the fans will greatly appreciate a quality reboot  and it will grow in value over time. it will be something they can actually continue.
its like Ive always been told  if at first you dont succeed  try  try  try the same exact thing over and over again..... wait a second Im remembering that wrong...
the character I had hope to feel some connection  turned out to be sauron xd. the dwarf durin son and father were ok too. and finally I would give another chance to elendil  wasn t that bad in my opinion. everything else... bad bad bad. wrong actors for the role  bad writen characters  etc. didn t feel that those people belonged to the same world of Lord of the rings and the hobbit. I couldn t stand looking at them. unless they are introducing some kind of multiverse idea  where this rings of power is just another universe... that would make sense.
melonie  Ive played tr since it came outeveryone  no way... youre not old enough....
to be honest  rebooting it would probably be a disaster. its obvious they wont learn from their mistakes and fix the problems with the writing and disrespect for the source material. so they ll just end up throwing more good money after bad.
what if they dumped rings of power  hired peter jackson and made  the silmarillion.   and just let peter jackson have the time and energy to just make it. no rush  just a well planned  well written  well made  loyal to tolkien s writing  show. that just made  the silmarillion.
the one and only way I could force myself to finish watch the show was   imagine this is a bad d d campaign written by a very bad game master and change all names in your head  ... for me  as tolkien fan  books also   this is much like eragon... they screwed up so much that is gonna be very hard to pull out something good from now on... and they can say all the time  tolkien never said that galadriel never been to numenor    I will always answer that the professor was meticulous  attentive and loving is world  if galadriel in some point went to numenor he would have talked about it... I completely understand it because Imyself have invented a fantasy world for a tabletop roleplay with his story and lore  luckily he s not here to see this...
Im tired of them thinking they can just  do better next time  after attacking and mocking the fans  they need to acknowledge what they have done and apologize. but they wont so let it burn.
I am one of those weird people who actually liked the show. probably because I never read any of the books  so my main exposure was the movies  and the original rotoscoped cartoon as a kid . I can definitely see the fans of the source material being absolutely upset though.
well  at least they already have the sets  effects  props and costumes in reserve.  Im sure they will make the most of them. but  here s what they should do.  partner with warner bros. on the next project and release it under warner bros. that way you have access to lore rights and a more complete production can be made.
I love how logical your arguments are.well done! I look forward to watching more of your content
could not have said it better myself. do your thing girl  cause you are. loved the video  and thats all they had to do.
I think sauron is the best character in season 1 because of the fact that he wasn t the main character. if he s the main one in season two it ll just be them trying to have us sympathize with him
rings of power is getting a reboot  is the  kathleen kennedy is getting fired any day now  of 2022. is this another doomcock rumour
somewhere I heard the phrase  the opposite of love is not hatred  but indifference. this is something the showrunners dont understand... we criticize some of their decisions not because we dont like the franchise  but just because we love it and it hurts us to see what happens to it.
my belief is that the older I get the worst entertainment of all forms  tv  movies  video games  books and music  get for the most part. Im not saying that there s not great entertainment being made  its just harder to find each year. your opinion is correct miss go boom.
that is the best case! I would pay x2 to see it rebooted.
haven t they already been shooting season 2 in the uk for the past month already
its like when you are in a relationship. with emotional attachment comes passion and with it comes care. when your expectations and trust are hugely let down by your close one or something you deeply care about comes a natural  strong emotional feedback.obviously people who feel hurt the most will criticize and pour out the pain the most  they will be most vocal. those people are not haters  they are really hurt lovers.its something I feel many either dont get or pretend to not get.
I ll patiently wait to see them make the same mistakes the second time around lmao.
watch they will redo it and still fuck it up again!!!!! people dont wakeup until the 3rd time around.  make a show worthy of watching a great show  diversity shouldn t matter make the characters great and people will watch.
let it die  let it die  let itshrivel up and die!
what lore rights do they have that amazon does not

hey melonie! this is going to be good!
there is no way this can be made better. after such a betrayal even a reboot wont be enough to regain my trust... rings of power is dead to me.
great vid  I agree with everything except your halbrand take  durin was by far the best character he was the only character I can picture i. the original triology
I dont think there s any chance of it being rebooted  these roomers of missive changes after a show or film flops never pan out  way more likely the show will tire to make minor changes in the next sessions and if that fails they ll unceremoniously cancel it after session 2 or session 3 if its an absolute failure. I think we re just going to have to accepted that we re not going to get a good show based off lotr  for a relay long time.
melonie  it cant be worse.amazon  hold my beer.
on the other hand the reboot could be happening because amazon is negotiating a deal with the tolkien estate for adaptation rights to  the fall of numenor  specifically which is due out in 5 days.making a crappy series covering the same time frame is a pretty good tactic to force the te to allow them access to the full material.
why do these companies keep forcing horrible things on to us. its like someone being a horrible person  and never changing.
I feel like to sell to the wide audience  lotr is best kept to a movie pacing. dont get me wrong. I would love a slow paced lotr series done right  but I feel it wouldent sell well to the broad audience. which is why I felt pj hit a magic middle ground with his films  which is why rop should be more a minImovie series then a Jesus... seven season tv series. at the end of the day its a buisness producing a product that needs to sell and make a profit  so diehard fans and the broad audience have to find a middle ground to sell.
chris gore is a specialist and an insider so he knows better than anyone  but personally I think they are 1 going to double down and move to second season2 take journalists and essentially people connected to awards for trips on the maldivas and whatnot in order to influence their opinions and then collect accolades and awards for the first season 3 very under the radar they ll replace the writers gradually
this show is what we got. now try to imagine how bad the material that ended up on the cutting room floor must have been ...
it cant be worse . hold my drink.  famous last words
what s the chances that they can convince peter jackson to oversee the rings of power reboot...
normally im quite against reboots  especially when the original was fairly recent. will make an exception in this case.
this is glorious. even after trying to cover everything up and lying saying oh everyone loves this. only to have to finally admit ok maybe it wasn t as big of a hit or good idea to do what we did. we really do just want a good show loyal to source material.
I truly  truly hope that this is more than a rumor! the only way I watch another second of anything amazon Lord of the rings is if amazon fires the showrunners and the writers and just starts back from square one.
its only been two months of this show  geez it feels like most of the year.
I would absolutely support a reboot if amazon flat out admitted what they did was a dumpster fire and basically apologized. if they actually listen to what everyone s been saying and write a show the honors tolkien it will be a massive success. I doubt they have the integrity to do that.
I agree. cancelling is like saying   this ip is no good.  but reboot is like saying   this ip has tons of potential  we just fucked it up with our first try.
a reboot would be pretty funny.
yes exactly! we  the fans  dont trash it because we want to but because we want a good story and not see a good franchise go down in flames. and we dont want a different story or characters because the story and characters is already good and its the original story and characters that made the fans like it in the first place. the only thing the fans want is a good adaption see the story the characters that are written in words become live action close to our imagination  basically. I am not speaking for all of course but this is my understanding from reading many comments on many different platforms. tbh going away from the lore here and there is the least problem but making the bigger picture totally different is or making changes that makes no sense or dont serve any purpose for the story is too like inserting a sister to isildur just because they want some female energy or whatever.I wanted and tried to like rings of power!
dude if you dont know by now you haven t been  paying attention.
@mrsushi1011  I have but just not these shows.
the only reason to focus a plot around who the bad guy is  is to only make them a sympathetic villain....oh he didnt want to be a evil dark Lord  his dad just didnt love him. you know who I never needed to know more about  sauron
wow this is the fastest reboot Ive seen since suicide squad
I cant even remember how it ended now. it was that good!
keep fighting the good fight melon. your e making a difference.
indeed in nothing is the power of the dark Lord more clearly shown than in the estrangement that divides all those who still oppose him.    -haldir.
as long as they stick to the lore I ll be happy
you just want to hate  no  we desperately wanted to love it  we were so excited for it and we hate because we feel lied to  betrayed and insulted
I guess I shouldn t get invested with a show unless everyone likes it.
I had to watch every single episode twice for I fell asleep the first watch on every episode. while house of dragons had me engaged throughout. rings of power had no build up of story  and it was filled with undertones.
had they simply listened to the fans in the first place  they could have avoided this disaster.
I think everyone knows almost everything these folks at amazon are saying is spin because of the money spent and the dumpster fire this has become. there was one line where she s quoting them and they are talking about how there is a  high bar  and   good and evil . yet in the show you took a civilization  the numenorians who were considered the greatest army of all time in middle earth and you made them a punch line. I talked with some people who watched the series and were like  who were the numenorians   they didn t even know the numenorians existed or who they were. Im sorry I see no way you fix this. there are some train wrecks that youre just better off letting hit the wall.
they could hire ian mckellen as a narrator. imagine gandalf in some minas tirith dungeon  reading old scrolls about the creation of the rings of power.
I said it before  and I ll say it again  if they reboot it  and actually follow the lore  then I will give it a chance.
canthey cancel it flat out  I thought there were contractual obligations for all 4 or 5 seasons.
I swear this will become a new trend. we ll see studios try multiple times on a season till its good if they can get away with it. can we get this treatment for the witcher  lol
canthey do the same for wheel of time   it got the exact same treatment.
west world was good all the way through. the last season wasn t so great but I was invested in it.
if they do that- big if!- they better start by getting someone who knows and loves tolkien lore! or they can just kiss it goodbye forever.
there is a tempest in me. when I bent over to tie my shoe  it escaped my ring of power. I shouldn t have had beans for lunch.
new word  ropflop. adjective  pronunciation  rawp - flop origin  combo of r.o.p   flop. exactly as it was.usage example  - I tried watching  woke as me  season 1  but I felt it ropflopped in the beginning of the show  so I burned it from my memory after roasting it on tiktok. it was such a ropflop in fact  that I went back to school  also thanks to my horse  to get a director degree to prevent such a travesty from happening again. - little did we know  that the ropflop phenomenon would eventually be proven to cause actual brain damage to viewers which is why woke died as the taint on society that it actually was. - I know one thing at least  ropflopping a show will not happen under my watch. I like starting memes. this one  I hope  is not.. well  a total ropflop.
do y all remember when peter jackson said that amazon asked him if he was interested in helming rop  and he said yes but they never got back to him
they should keep this series  but just cut the budget a lot and continue it as a kids show or on a kids network   because thats what it is essentially - a hoaky kids teen show      then with a whole new cast and the bulk of the budget make a proper rebooted  adult  version.. or maybe make a specific more focused story within the 2nd age    also obviously needs to be on par with hotd and got
the 2 showrunners called tolkien s writing stupid on a podcast recently.
today too many people believe some random rumours. but common sense tells you that this not the case. there are two possibilities. 1. they continue with the show like planned. 2. they tweak the show a little to make is better. all we can hope for is they choose option 2 and make a better season 2. after all not everything was bad and sometimes a show needs a season oder even two until they find the sweet spot
heard rumor that a firefly reboot is being tossed around   I hope not  one season and a movie wasnt enough  but it was genuinely well written with great stories  dont kill another franchise hollywood !
new rings of power starts the moment first death star is being built.
I feel like that whatever route they decide to take  its still going to be woke in some way.
im not saying this is the case but at some point people like to hate things and that line is very thin these days. there are certainly some good moments within rings of power but overall its pretty chaotic experience.
might give the reboot a try. after trustworthy critics recommend it. maybe.
there s nothing worse as an artist than being selfish  you can make whatever you want  use your freedom. but as a creative you always have to think about who is going to be taking in your art. straddle the line between creative freedom and what the audence actually wants. technically thats just taking into consideration how people will view and react to what youre making. which is itself really just thinking about marketing and building the marketing into the product ahead of the fact. weather you make concessions or not is in the end  up to you. but when it backfires  you ll either fail and be forgotten. or it ll blow up and you ll anger and sadden a large portion of people that either loved you your work  or the work that you had a hand in making. as always the biggest losses are in the realms of time and potential. its often very difficult to spot the fakes in certain fields. art is very subjective so its a difficult one  but even if youre not knowledgable about cinematography or how sound affects mood in a scene. framing. choreography. even the untrained eye can see there s something wrong. they cant always place what it is  but they can feel the wrong and they recoil. honestly you can be making a piece of art with all the best intention and good messages but in my opinion art has its own life. artists merely hone and chip away at the stone to reveal the beauty beneath. when we create too consciously all that comes out of us is our own convoluted tripe of a human consciousness. to be free you need to let go not hold on. let the art be what the art wants to be. stop dictating. that goes for the audience too  dont be so fast to dismiss because it could be your next nerdy passion.
unfortunately I believe gary from nerdrotic clarifies that the reboot isn t a potential hard reboot but a a public image reboot in where they will bring in influencers and other people to hype up the first season and act like the bad press never happened during the past 2 months.
real fans have been saying this the whole time. and its beyond saving.
I haven t even watched this show since I dont have prime and dont plan to get it. doesnt sound like Im missing much.
it did have gandalf  it had hobbits  elves  etc  and yes focus on powerful and brave woman.
so what to expect from the 2nd season plot  sauron gets out of bed in a cold sweat for the love of illuvatar what a dream... nightmare!! he says to himself  in his bed crouched down from the scare he repeats to himself  it was just a bad dream  a bad dream  grabs his stuffed orc and returns to sleep  waking up the next morning the new plot goes on
they will reboot it but all the view stats from the original first sesson will be added to the reboot to make it look even more successful lol
how do amazon stand any chance with continuing it or rebooting it in regards to becoming more successful I dont know if amazon are happy with the viewership numbers and I dont know the ratings. etc. but I have seen a clear divide between tolkien fans on all platforms and even in person  so let s say for arguments sake that 50  of tolkien fans like it and 50  of tolkien fans dont like it.if amazon continues with rop as it is  only the current people watching it will continue to watch it and the other 50  aren t going to suddenly start watching it.amazon will possibly get some new viewers due to people browsing for something to watch  but like all tv shows they will also lose viewers along the way for all sorts of reasons.maybe amazon are perfectly happy with the numbers and maybe the money backers dont care if they lose money as they have so much of it that this is just a toy to play with.amazon also have a sneaky safety net compared to other streaming networks. netflix etc will panic and reverse programming if people start unsubscribing  but amazon is a little different considering so many people shop through them for physical goods and the majority of the rop haters wouldn t unsubscribe because they still shop with amazon and it is very convenient. if amazon reboots rop  the current fans of rop will be angry and not want to watch it and the fans who dislike rop probably wont want to watch the reboot because they have been villainized and they distrust amazon. so outside of a new actor showing up who is really popular  I dont see how this show is going to become more successful... the same viewership or less  sure.either way the entire thing is ass backwards considering this is the same streaming platform that brought us apparently far right shows like the terminal list.
scene 1 episode 1  of season 2   somebody wakes up  and season 1 was just a bad dream.
they just made this.   you have to wait 10 years to do a reboot of anything.
y know I d love to see a news story abt any of these sauron-level evil corporations like disney   amazon getting audited. that first season must ve  disappeared   300 million or more. the costumes  the makeup   effects  or lack thereof   were so bad. even a lot of the sets were cheaply made crap    made in after effects.those dumpster abortions who wrote   directed will never work again  regardless of what happens  I sincerely hope.
didn t they already bring in influencers who were pretending to be tolkien fans to try and lure in viewers  it would be pretty insane for amazon to try the same trick again thinking it will suddenly work this time.
too little too late... I have no confidence in their back story for sauron after seeing what they did to guyladriel
which is sadder  the Lord of the rings the rings of power gets a reboot  or an award
they have put too much money in to give up now - even though they should give up just in order to save themselves from more embarrassment.
I dont think its possible to make a good adaptation without all the rights of this story.
season 2 likely coming fall 2024.
I just wanted a good Lord of the rings show  at least the house of the dragon has been good so far
itsucks when our favorite franchises get crushed under the weight of stupidity.  not only does it mean their best days are behind them  but that what is to come will only smear their name in the future.  ea bioware did this to my mass effect.
funny thing is... we told  em this would happen.
if they want another chance  tom shipley better be the new showrunner asking.
wait  what I thought bazillions of people were watching the show. sounded like a rousing success to me.
I thought they already made five seasons worth of plots  guess that getting tossed out the window.
actually  my biggest disappointment was that they didn t put the non cgI intro  the rings of power  which was shown in one of the videos prior to the show
they sound like every fighter ever after a loss  well learn from this and come back stronger
well said hopefully help people understand why we are so passionate about are hubby s  literature.
dont think they will reboot the show  but if they do it  its the best they could do  because  the show has no chance to comeback strong after all the lore they broke  and the bizzare way it was filmed  they think we are dumb   I still cant get out of my mind  the fact that galadriel and the numenorians were charging to the town like they knew there was something going on there  I was laughing for quite some time.
while Im hopeful this is true  I ll have to believe it when it happens.
yes  we re lacking for good entertainment these days.  this is why I am watching re-runs of older shows every day instead of new crap that keeps coming out of hollywood these days.
the only reason they are focusing on sauron is because he was one of the only likeable characters with depth to him  this tells me they ll end up ruining sauron as well
why rebooting  wasn t the rings of power received well  Im confused. all the reviews and scores on amazon and imdb  prebooting rings of power   yes  we faked the shit out of the reviews
assuming viewers managed to stay awake long enough to get through the show  when the best parts of rop were watching a discount hobbit die and sauron calling out guyladriel s bs  you definitely screwed up.
all things considered  sometimes you just have to look yourself in the mirror and say   the sea is always right.   only then can youreflect on assessing your privilege and getting a good idea on how patently evil you are.  I personally felt renewed and as a result I decided to change my pronouns to celebrate. Im also now identifying as a toaster. thanks amazon!
so henry cavill as superman in the new rings of power
if lotr rop going to season 2  it is not getting  rebooted . they have to go back and re-do season 1  episode 1. a story s major plot problems and character problems cannot be fixed by carrying on with act iI  because act iI will always be bound to continue what was in act i.
amazon spent way too much money  even for amazon  on this ip to create this show so they re not just going to leave it hanging after this colossal failure. of course  they ll reboot.
I thought it was the best series of the year so far
this would be the best possible future for the show - galadriel wakes up from a nightmare  chastising herself for not realizing she was dreaming when a volcano blast to the face didn t kill her. and then she gets out of bed and everything makes sense. Im rooting for this very much. but the second-best thing would be for the show to stay just as stupid as it is now for four more seasons  because its bad enough to be hilarious  and its awfulness has brought many people together who didn t agree on much before. I feel more united now with my fellow fantasy fans around the world than I did three months ago.the worst future is one where things get retooled  the dialogue and plotlines get improved  and the show s quality rises from epic awfulness to just being meh-bad show.  sadly  I think the worst future is also the likeliest.
wait.. are they actually rebooting
I saw a girl swing a two handed sword around like a tree branch and I never watched another episode after that lol
wait  think about it.  if amazon announce a reboot already it will absolutely get people to watch the rings of power to see just how bad it is.  this is evil genius stuff.
careful what you wish for. if rings of power gets a reboot then no more quartering intros with galadriel threatening everyone with  the old ice troll treatment.
that is actually crazy! talks of a possible reboot   already   man... they really screwed the pooch with this one.
so they plan to return properly to the source material they could definitely learn a thing or ten  or a hundred or thousand  from the writers of the cobra kaI series - they built on the original material and applied to modern audiences the right way. just sayin
oh boy!!! they re creating a galadriel-verse.  yay.  rings of poo-er season 5    galadriel   no way home!!!  cant wait.
this is nothing but rumor  and an unlikely one at that. if anything  it ll be a soft  reboot  in fact I read  retooling  somewhere and thats more accurate imo. no way will they hard reboot but if it did  either they get down on their knees and get peter jackson and his crew on board or this ship is just going to sink again.
not gonna lie I fall asleep watching rings of power multiple times
as a wise man once said   do not trust to hope.  it has forsaken these lands.   Im not expecting anything good to come from further seasons of this show  unless their is a clear and effective restructuring from top to bottom.  I find that highly unlikely though.
kept in the writers room  interesting way of saying janitorial staff
scenes need to have a sense of how it connects to the stakes and will contribute to the whole.  do you know why a ship floats and a stone cannot   because the stone sees only downward.
thought rings of power did so well why would they reboot it lol
so season 2  in the hands of those guys  will be even worse. sauron as main character the problem will be exactly the same one with that character in s1  they turned sauron into a human. Im not talking about the form  but the filings and behaviour. he as not pretending to be a human  he as acting like one. vengeance  doubts  questioning himself  etc. to me  that was the biggest insult to tolkien s canon. and then  they say he is complexity evil like some other human bad guys     no he is not. sauron is an evil spirit. no human elven hobbit dwarf feeling  differently from gandalf  for example  was not sent to me as human and therefore limited by human sereneness. sauron just pretend to be human. yes  if you imagine that the whole show is not related to lotr  halbrand would be the best  or less bad  character  descent acting  more or less for the development  etc . but then... being sauron just destroyed it completely.

I dont think its about  not admitting defeat . its about owning the commercial rights to a literally legendary franchise that virtually screems  gold mine!  and at last raking in its potential. at least they apparently realized that  while there is tons of profit to be made of middle earth  this particular franchise  unlike many others and in contrast to what they re used to  requires certain standards to be met and is pretty much unforgiving about coming short of that.
here s the thing there is a little choice but to do a reboot. thats how fucking badly the timeline is screwed. like the tolkien estate screamed bloody murder when pj made changes to make the films a better visual experience. like Ive heard multiple stories referencing that the estate told amazon not to contact pj. there was also the issue with revenue about the trilogy but that had nothing to do with pj and was a fight between the estate and the film company so if they re holding a grudge against him for that than they re more petty than I believed. rop has butchered everything so badly thatsome super cool events cant even happen now. the big one being the actual forging of the other rings as they know sauron is around now and surely wont trust any stranger offering gifts anytime soon. all the screenwriters had to do was create rumours and legends around a being called annatar and maybe reveal him towards the middle or end of s1. boom! this would you allow to actually have galadriel do her in lore thing of making a kingdom with her husband and daughter. and not whatever monstrous they created with her. celebrimbor doing his thing with the dwarves and eventual making lesser rings and the rings of power with annatar. elrond having a nice romance story in s1 with galadriel s daughter maybe. s2 could have a time jump of 90 years with annatar being discovered as sauron. gil-galad warns numenor about sauron which eventually makes them mobilise. s2 finale is numenor capturing sauron at mordor. s3 corruption of numenor and finale is the downfall and you could stretch this with fleshed out minI stories about made up minor characters but remove the cannibal har-foots and pointless southlanders as their storylines are completely useless and pointless. you ask how are the southlanders pointless okay  answer me these questions. why does the elf love the human woman  when do they fall in love  why does she care for the village  do you even remember the woman s name or her sons
it was all a dream of saruman wanting to get there now. let s hear that the writers are fired
so they want to give us what we wanted from the start well that is a shame because I already cancelled my amazon subscription and Im not coming back.I will check back on rings of power in 2032 to see if it got any good.
Ive seen more facial expressions in a ps2 game than ring of power
no way they actually reboot it
I hope so.
if you want good entertainment  rrr can give you some.  same with extraordinary attorney woo.  reacher was good  not perfect  but good.
hell yeahI just wanna get told a good story and take a break from realityI dont wanna get shoved their ideology into my facein every movie  series or game...
has  superfan my girl galadriel  binged rop yet now that hod is finished with season1
dont worry melonie. the show runners  writers and producers dont have the talent or the intelligence to actually fix lotrtrop. it will just be disgustingly bad in slightly different ways. so there will be plenty ofmaterial and dimwitted ideas for all the content you and other creators care to produce about it
they signed for four seasons  so no reboot  contracted for four seasons.
my respect for amazon as a studio would go through the roof if they admitted they fucked up  completely cleaned house and 100  rebooted the show.
Im soooooooo sceptical of the gears movie from netflix as there is a very strong potential fuck up happening but in contrast I have strong hope in the animated series
when Im in charge would you want and a lot of your fellow tubers want to be in it and help with getting the lore and direction correctly the  filmography work.
at this point  they should just make galadriel take frodo  gandalf  legolas and sauron s roles into her one dimensional character...coz you know...strong  female  lead etc.
getting reboot but has a season two  hmm odd
I cant understand why they want a reboot  they seemed so confident in all there choices for the season and just brushed off all criticism as racist toxic etc etc. why are they acting scared now
haven t they already filmed the second season  I thought it was being edited.
they didn t get sauron right either. he s supposed to he this otherworldly being with a history going back thousands of years. why do they think they d do that justice by basically turning him human
he is a shapeshifter.  he shapeshifts into a vampire and a werewolf in the first age and mimics an elf in the second.  not too much of a stretch to imagine he could appear as a mere human.
my first reaction seeing this opening stuff when this show came out was   well this lady seems really insanely overpowered as a warrior and I dont recall there being a character like that but whatever.  let s see what happens.   then it was shown she was galadriel and it turned into   no  no she is not galadriel.   then I tuned out and never looked back.  everyone I know who likes this show  no surprise  is not actually a Lord of the rings fan and knows nothing about it beyond the peter jackson movies.  even then most of them will say they thought it would be better than it was.
it wasn t tolkien it was wo-kien.
to completely reboot the rop they need to change all the staff   actors included    burn the old script and focus on the lore  quality writing  and acting quality...
cant be done. nobody is capable of making anything these days that isn t for the  modern audience .
they also need to repair much of the visuals  like the plastic armor.
if its made by amazon  I dont want it. they had their chance  and it is more than likely they are going to try some icky shady shit involving more activism  no matter how small the amount is.
if this new reboot show is better than rings of power series that I would want to see it but if the reboot show is not good to watch then I will not waste my time and watch the reboot show bc of it being like rings of power show series  ok melonie. anyway thats what I wanted to say bout this topic of this video for today  ok melonie. anyway hope you have had a great day today at home and hope you continuing to have a wonderful and great blessed evening at home with your parents and have a good night too melonie.
I am all for pretending the rings of power never happened  but they cant give me that time back.  not just from the first episode Imanaged to slog through but also hearing how awful it is from everyone who s seen it.  they already screwed their chance to get me to watch more.  its just not how I watch episodic content.  if I watch something  I will decide by the first episode  and then I will only see it in order.  I absolutely refuse to go back and watch the rest of the first season  so no  I dont care how much they change it.  they failed.
melanie mac go boom on that 100k special within two  three weeks max
acquires part of the rights to one of the greatest franchises of all time  written by one of the greatest writers of the 20th century.amazon   I think we ll get a bunch of half-wits to rewrite it.
if this is true  I am all for it. fire all the old writers  get in some writers spesically ones that will stay true to the lore and not change things based on their own biased opinions. hell just get some writers and hire some hard core Lord of the ring fans to help screen the script  if they feel like the writers cant do it by themselves.
a rumour within a rumour is but a shadow of our hope and dreams! lol.
the problem is sauron was done well by this actor but he isn t the sauron from token he s completely a different character.
you should totally watch house of the dragon. its good
canthey give it to the guy that made andor  tolkien would rise from his grave just so he could watch it as well.
if they want to make money off lotr  maybe they should let someone make videogames about it  because what we re sorely lacking these days are games based on lotr. if we re lucky it would be a developer far enough removed from amazon so they dont mess it up.
I wonder what the next franchise is going to be  that gets destroyed.
cant believe it. that would be the most humilating  we failed.  in entertainment history ever - above all after such a giant  critics are just  everything evil -ists  pr stunt.
I call bs on the showrunners  apology.
imagine if amazon needed to sell galadriel toys and t-shirts to recuperate the investment
hire myself as a writer and let me find the right actors and actresses.
dude I played the original tomb raider on a pre windows 95 machine with nothing but the keyboard and mouse as controls and beat it. it was awesome back then.
wait but wasn t it massive successful
the best way to make this happen is keep up the pressure. troll their posts  amazon decision makers  shills.  but no violence or threats
time to call bad robot
the new series will be called fans of power.
I dont think a reboot is happening. season one was a deliberate destruction of tolkien s work  just like hollywood have done with so many other classical stories in the last few years. the intended destruction job was performed with perfection. so why would they change what they did in purpose
when will the powers that be realize they cant hijack other peoples beloved hard work  tolkien  and turn it into something that it isn t to  make it better . people wont stand for it.
the lady that did this woke makeover is the same one who fired the guys making a  toxic masculinity  version of conan  they then went to hbo and made house of the dragon
give it back to warner brothers discovery and let them do it right
they must reboot it if they want to save it  honestly it had so much potential but they ruined it.
formula  make the show for the tolkien base  the casual viewer will not know the difference and just follow a long.result  instant hit..  but start to slip in the woke nonsense and they will lose even more money.at tbis time they need to win back the fan base.  the all-time  largest fantasy  genre ever.
needs more they them I think xd
I get how you feel  I guess Im more neutral than most  the cinematic release is never allways true to the the source material though. if youread most books and compare them to the movie counterparts you will find they change a few details  remove 2 or 3 characters so on and so forth  thats just hollywood though. you will get those who hate the series and those who love the series  even if they do do a reboot I guarantee that 50  of the population will find something even if its some little detail to complain about which is sad as its just a fantasy with no real world consequence. I can also guarantee that there are more real world issues to resolve than a series in a fictional world.
well.. we forgave the x-men movies for declaring that wolverine origin story non-cannon  so amazon can have another crack at it  and I ll give it a chance.. if they take their medicine and get it right this time.
I would laugh my butt off if this takes emmy awards reputation down with it. awards season - I know what awards it will attract. it will reap the rotten tomatoe and other grand satirical failure awards.
hollywood doesnt understand the difference between fans and consumers. to them  the terms are synonymous. they had no idea what they had with star wars  because they weren t fans themselves. unless they hired people who were alive and going to the movies in 1977  especially as a child  they just dont know what a life-changing and inspiring movie that was. they dont get it. these franchises are just random bits of pop culture dressed up as the things we once loved.
lol. this made my morning! xd
nerdrotic would happily cancel his own wife for a drop of clout
was that  morally  bankrupt or  financially  bankrupt
if they thought they gave galadriel good back story in season one  and are planning to do the same for sauron in season 2  I predict zero good characters remaining for season 3
they should hire talented writers who actually love and respect tolkien s work  bringing back tom shippey  recast all the actors  do a batter job with costumes and pretend the 1st season doesnt exist  then probably it will be a good show. but we know thats not gonna happen. they wont admit defeat  they wasted a billion dollars and they lose more.
are you subscribed to these streaming platforms  melonie blessings from m xico
have webber and salke been fired and banned from amazon yet     thats a critical first step in the right direction.
I called it a month ago. season 1 was so bad they had no choice but to reboot it
I watched on a pirate app and enjoyed the first 2 episodes because I dont give a shit about tolkien works but by episode 4 I quit and still somehow wanted my money back from amazon
it wont be a reboot. instead they re more likely to focus on a different character s and their points of view.
they ll save more money by just canceling it
8 08 we live in a day where we use sonic as a good example for Lord of the rings.let thatsink in...
amazon  we spent a billion dollars to tick off troll the fans and that didn t net a profit
if they legit reboot it and make an effort to remove the garbage  I d applaud them.  if they just shift to new garbage dont bother.
please start putting the verse of the day back in. I really enjoyed that. God bless you and your family. duane.
they wont reboot it  that is way to expensive....the last 2 episodes were good and has better ratings  so be patient and watch it or dont..
professor tolkien was still alive when I first started reading lotr. this is what you get when with writers with out any credits and coming from bad roboot  robot . the thing is galadriel was nothing like who she should have been. mc kay and payne haven t a clue about cannon.
a room full of writters who think they can do better
indeed those responsible for this will reap the foolishness that they have sewn. the people of ithilien shall never compromise the truth for the feelings and opinions of those motivated by greed.
the only way anyone s going to give this a second chance if they fire everyone involved  preferably from a cannon  especially payne  mckay  weber and salke  and hire an entirely new team that includes mr. shippey.
warrior galadrrriel reloaded!!
so amazon wants to trick up the marketing to bring a wave of binge-watching s1 of rop  yeah  if the competition is not binge-watching paint drying on another channel. I love thatstuff. I would watch a good tolkien show  however.
they want the awards  but such circlejerks have lost all effect it had on normal people.
just re edits1 as a sit com about a crazy lady  in a medieval ally mcbeal style  that would be worth watching
but  but  buuuuuuuut  it was so inclusive  so stunning and brave!almost as if it was so stunning and brave that people who wanted to see Lord of the rings couldnt find any recognition of it and left for better things to do and watch that actually represent what it claimst to be and whodont call its customers ist and fobes for demanding a product that is not a total false advert.
galadrimel
there is no way they ll reboot it this fast. just wishful thinking.
forget forgetting everything you now dont know about middle earth....
they spent a billion dollars on this shit. even if it were good there s no way in hell that you could possibly recoup such an insane budget
the dumbest thing about this show was how they made the entire elven race white and then one black elf with no explanation what so ever. its one of the most immersion breaking things Ive ever seen in a show and its no different than making a film about an africantribe  throwing one white actor in there and expecting everyone to believe he s an african and calling them racist if they have a problem with it.
they need to cancel it. so our bill doesnt keep going up every year.
still funny how people raging about rings of power not following the books but then saying there super fans of the peter jackson films and totally ignore they dont follow the books aswell lol
I believe the salient fact is... the t.r.o.p. producers didn t have the rights to the story sooo  if they re going to reboot get the friicken rights to the story.
do a time skip  easy reboot without admitting defeat
wow your hair is beautiful  what do you use to keep itso nice  love it and love your videos too
honestly at this point amazon is robbing us of our time. they should ve just put those billion of dollars in invincible season 2  movies  and maybe  a live adaptation. but instead they are just throwing it all away into politics.
this was literally my suggestion.
thank God for peter jackson!
honestly I think this would be the right approach. a full reboot is really the only option because season one can not be saved by anyone. dont fool yourself  this is a good thing for everyone if true. good for the tolkien fans. good for amazon.but amazon needs to publicly say they were wrong for pulling reviews.
I would definitely love to see them simply throwing everything out  including showrunners  writers  everything! then they should hire people that actually love tolkien s works and add several tolkien scholars to the team as well. that way we might actually get something that is worthy of tolkien  instead of this piece of crap that had nothing in common with tolkien at all where they even fired the tolkien scholar for warning them that they were  polluting the lore .rings of power was a complete disaster and even though I have access to prime video I definitely was not going to pollute my brain with this garbage. I want something true to tolkien s lore.
a reboot after a month wow thats a new record in fuckups I think Ive ever seen
anybody who had more than a passing interest in lotr opined at length about how much of a dumpster fire the show looked like from the first trailer. so its just fascinating that the reports now are all saying how nobody could have possibly predicted this.just how large does a franchise price tag need to be for a studio to be able to afford self-preservation instincts like  maybe the people shrieking that all criticism is race sexist aren t automatically correct
they wont do it probably  but wouldnt that be brave
imagine thinking that trashing tolkien s work with mary sue galadriel and androgynous elrond  making it woke would be  successful with tolkien audiences
amazon is learning the difference between love isn t hate....but apathy.
they are just trying a  reboot  in the star wars vein. they will not bring attention to the stupid things they have done to break the canon of tolkien but they wont reboot it either. they will throw out some hints at cool stuff to string hard core fans along and give them something to talk about but it will be the same stuff only now they will take more inspiration from breaking bad and sopranos.
funny how the crowd saying  hater!  ends up shilling for big companies. its like they re paid off.
I feel like I would need to finish season 1 to even bother with season 2. not going to happen. stopped mid episode 4
as I said before  this show should have set a new standard for a high budget super-show. in no way is game of thrones a better fantasy world than the one in Lord of the rings. middle-earth is the best fantasy world ever created. the rop executives and show-runners wants a reward  they should hope that they dont get a golden raspberry one.
well it was supposed to be middle earth meets game of thrones  and there was a call for actors and actresses who were comfortable with nudity. so  were was the political intrigue  the murders and the nudity
so they re are just gonna reboot it  and do the same thing all over again. lol maybe this time around make it even worst. looks like amazon is on the right track.
I dont expect any sort of public acknowledgement of a reboot or drastic course shift  but I do expect the next season to essentially start with a clean slate.thatsaid I think the best we can hope for is something like the hobbit trilogy  desperate fan-pandering without any artistic restraint.
what  I dont understand I saw a video of a group of superfans who got to see a preview and they loved ithow can it be bad  they were superfans
so they are trying to paint galadriel as a short  young  1000 year elf who could have fallen for a man she terribly wants to kill. never minding galadriel is married  this is a bad romance novel or daytime soap opera at best.
briane of tarth would have been a more convincing galadriel for what they where trying to do. height   warrior look .
season two.. they will have a gollum character...the nobbits will have a quest..the elf and that woman will admit that the annoying kid is theirs  gandalf will have a run in with saruman  the dwarves will be rotund and jovial..sauron will create more white orcs.. galadriel will go for another swim fully clothed in her pyjamas...
the japanese have a term for  their role will be reduced  when someone screws up badly...  given a window seat .
I like the card game for tomb raider. its fun
we all saw how rebooting the third saga of star wars went with the sequel trilogy  7 8 9  by trying to placate fans and I think we all just want original content that is well written. this is not on the actors for rings of power  this is on the creative direction. yourecall if you watched the season of rings of power thatsome episodes were just drawn out dramas that did not really have much going on. I thought  huh  why are they not delving into characters more  they had opportunities to make them smart too and left out so many elves and storyline. my biggest criticisms of the rings of power were because of slow meandering sequences of mostly landscape with very little progression in the characters. I think the actors did amazing. for me  itseems to have been the director or producer making odd choices on thematic choices that resulted in questionable conclusions for characters and lots of plotholes.
this is hilarious.  however  if amazon did rings of power correctly  I ll actually give it a try.  I have amazon prime already  but have zero motivation to watch the horrible product they trotted out for season 1.they should actually pay creators from  if I can use the expression  the fandom menace to serve as consultants. they simply must have people who are passionate about the Lord of the rings  both the novels and the three movies  let s not talk about the hobbit movies  please  as the showrunners.  they should also re-hire that tolkien expert that they fired because he didn t like the crap that they were doing. and yes  people in authority in the rebooted production have to be experts on the Christopher tolkien - edited books.  you know  the works that take up half of a bookcase shelf in my home.
I do not think there will be a reboot. this is probably a pr trick for damage control.
why they wanna force things that doesnt correspond to that age  like gandalf or making the rings  the mandalorian is a good example you can succeed working with new things  and their sauron looks like a simple guy that you can find at a walmart pfff  among many many mistakes
the real question is how did a show with  so much money poured in it ended in the hands of people who have 0 experience in fantasy and 0 knowledge of tolkien s work   how do you say to yourself yeah let s hire dudes who think they re better writers than freaking tolkien !!!
if they re going to do a reboot why not just go ahead and make it a comedy.
probably shouldn t be firing tolkien experts and bashing fans...
being such a fan of tomb raider did you like croc
this is the same crap that happened to both star trek and star wars. this woke culture  mind virus  has infected nearly every corner of pop culture as well as the cultural  educational  and governmental institutions. a man by the name of yurI besminov warned us of this in the eighties. he was actually featured briefly in the cod  cold war intro. his interviews and lectures are highly prophetic as to what we are going through now.
if they lost so much money  how canthey have the money to reboot it
they truly underestimated the dedication to lore of the Lord of the rings   tolkien fans around the world.. the only footage I have seen from the show is from all the people that I follow on youtube that their channels are dedicated to the lore of tolkien s universe and middle earth.. they are so far off track they should just cancel the show completely.
amazon doing lotr might be worse than disney doing narnia. albeit csl was respected a bit more  possibly because it was done during a time when disney wasn t as woke as it is now  and still had some desire to please the audience. but  even so  between the feud with walden media and disney blundering things by trying to grow the market by trying to appeal to every audience  rather than let prince caspian stand on its own. dawn treader was at least better  but too little  too late  only going to show how disney has become notorious for being the place where franchises go to die.
wow that didn t take long lol not even a month
yea but how credible is this source though  feels more like a rumor we ll all forget about and then season 2 roles in. I hated rop  but I d be interested in a reboot. partly because of a small hope of a better outcome  but also Im just curious. I dont know if Ive ever seen a reboot before. at least not one because of such a big failure with too many  ero behind it.
better to do it early  so maybe they can get some of that money back.
hire tolkien scholars. consult with peter jackson. get writers who understand  respect and love tolkien s works. and maybe it will end up being worth watching
get jackson back as director and script writer and you ll have a master piece
u rock!
after watching nerdrotic s vid and seeing the ceo s photo it all comes off as a vanity project of hers I didn t watch any of rop cant lend my time to it
unless they hire peter jackson and entire lotr trilogy crew and veta workshop they would be better off just canceling it... even all that wouldn t be enough if writers are not up to the task...
love your voice
I dont understand why amazon even bothered with this if it wasn t 100  for the fans. imagine getting ahold of the rights to make a batman movie  or something  and instead of making a good batman movie you purposefully make a turd just to stick it to the  toxic   translation  passionate  fans.
even if the show doesnt keep it the way its going. its not gonna be good
who here really believes that a reboot is even possibly going to happen there is no chance
no more guyladriel
while I like peter  he wasn t all that respectful in his treatment all of the time.     frodo was wimpified.   all the way through the films.     faramir and denethor s characterisations  - also a betrayal.this is not a defence of rop but these changes from pj are not minor ... and will never be.
the same jackson who wimpified frodo s character so much that there are many people in this fandom who regard frodo as a complete waste of space and not deserving sam s loyalty.  these people have never read the books and judge frodo solely on the films  characterisation.  alas.  I saw pj s lotr films multiple times in the cinema. they are great films  but they have flaws - and this is their biggest.  frodo is my favourite character .
@philippa linton  I respect your viewpoint and disagreement and I wont argue that the trilogy as well as the hobbits trilogy have flaws and are not perfect. but  can you compare them with this trash amazon s disaster  I would rather have some nonsense and flaws from peter than this bs from amazon 100 times over.  I think we will agree that peter s was more loyal to the original story than these two morons directing ring of power
@frozen kombat  I can certainly agree that overall pj s lotr is more faithful to tolkien and is a better product than rop.  there is much in the films I love ... which makes me care more about the stuff thats disappointing. the hobbit films were mostly awful - shame  because the cast was great.
@philippa linton  I really like the hobbit but I get what you say. thx bud
I think if they can do a reboot and actually focus on the story  it might be successful. the wokies wouldn t be happy about this...
amazon the retailer is said to push its employees to the limits of their endurance in order to squeeze out as much profit as possible. no regard for them as human beings. ask yourself if a leadership of that kind is going to have any regard for a literary work or any comprehension of what human beings actually want to watch.
amazon  we re sorry  this season we are going to give the fans what they want.the fans  its too little too late  sorry chump checkmate
its not difficult to succeed with this 1  consult peter jackson. you know  the man who made what is now a legendary trilogy of movies based off tolkien s work that of course  wasn t faithful to the source material in every way  but it was very entertaining  if a little bit too long per movie . a one to one adaptation isn t always the answer and I think some modifications and changes are welcome  but the changes they did in the rings of power were an example of what not to do.2  stop shoving diversity where it doesnt belong. Im all for diversity  but the diversity shown here is illogical. diversity needs to be an inherent part of the character or needs to make complete sense. tolkien described elves as a race with fair skin and possessing an ethereal beauty that no mere mortal could match  as well as being  pale-skinned . live up to the man s lore and stop trying to reflect the world we live in today. this is a fantasy work. which means  itshould be the polar opposite of the world we live in today.3  stop trying to make these flawless characters. every single character that was presented in tolkien s work  as well as peter jackson s adaptation  had caveats. the closest thing to a flawless character they had was legolas  but even he failed at several parts. galadriel herself  who was supposed to represent the best of the elves  had a moment of weakness that was outright terrifying in the first movie. its fine for characters to have flaws  because it allows an audience to relate to them and in turn  grow to embrace them.4  think about the fans. I understand that they re trying to make the ip accessible to everyone so a bit of thinning out the lore is understandable  but they need to understand that most of their audience is gonna be the fans of tolkien s work and the movie trilogy. most average joes  are not gonna gravitate towards a series like this because odds are  they re gonna look up stuff about the series  see that its based on a bunch of old books and then maybe  they ll give it a go. the vast majority of people who are gonna talk about it however  are the existing fans. treat the property accordingly and understand that trying to appeal more to the average joe will result in pissing off the fans.the rings of power disappointed me so massively that Im skeptical about them rebooting unless I hear that peter jackson is on board  or that they get true fans of tolkien s work. and some people might argue and say that Christopher tolkien approved the rings of power  but considering that he hated the movie trilogy  Im not entirely sure he s the authority to take an opinion from. I think millions of fans matter more than a guy who for some reason  hates the movie trilogy that catapulted the entire ip into popularity in the first place.anywho  thats just my two cents.
going to be hard to win any viewers back.
I think it would be funny if a new galadriel woke up and realized the entire first season was a dream. I dont usually criticize actors  but I think clark is a weak link. of course  the writers need to go  hire veterans with a good track record and bring back the  tolkien scholars .
the eff ups started with buying rights to the wrong books. as with got we can see that general people aren t capable of creating these stories.
the definition of insanity.
I judge people  actions and things on an individual basis. if a  supposed  reboot comes out and I find it to be good  I will support it. but I will still criticize the road taken to get to it...
what  a reboot
anyone who openly is saying they couldn t anticipate this show was going to be a dumpster fire should be fired.
a full reboot is the only chance they have at saving this show.  but it must be non-woke and be respectful of the lore and the fans...and on top of that it needs to be good!all that is a tall order  but its the only chance they have.
lol the audacity to compare him to walter white. one of the best written tv shows ever  with one of the best written  villains  in tv history. compared to this blend 2 dimensional  buh huh I am sauron emo boy   what the hell is happening.
to be fair  star trek the next generation was really awful the first two seasons  and did not hit its stride until season three. ds9 really didn t get good until sisko shaved his head lol. you never know  maybe this show will get its act together like stng and ds9.
just turn the black elf and the black hobbits into orcs and it ll be ok.
fans dont want the shows movies to be written directed etc by people who actively despise the source material. its pretty simple. Im open to write   or direct...
they need to hire real tolkien scholars and fans.  they need to buy the book and then go by the book as much as possible for a series.and  fire all the writers directors and producersas a kid reading tolkien saved my ass in the 6th grade because I was bored shitless at the reading level of the material for it and the previous 2 grades.   but anyway tolkien s attention to detail  when necessary  is what I loved.this butchery of his work is something I cant stand.   if you think Im strict about it I know a friend who simply refuses to see even the movies.
its kinda hilarious to me that the only people who ever put up w s in the culture war are nerds.
you know what  they already made sauron the hero of the piece. just roll with it and have him execute order 66 on the elves  dwarves  numenoreans and non-space wizards. make it a glorious bloodbath of desecration of him sweeping through  betraying  seducing and uniting me under his banner with guy-lad-real chained to his throne like a slave dancing girl. let him rise to epic triumph to epic triumph  since they tossed out everything tolkein wrote  but give it to some good writers  not these lame nobodies.
they have to fire everybody and bring peter jackson as a director  and let him pick the writers  and give him enough time.
the rings of power is neither Lord of the rings  or anything tolkien. they have abused the privilege of attempting to bring tolkien on the big screen  and have completely trashed most things tolkien believed in and stood for. tolkien would have despised this adaptation  and partly to blame is also his money hungry grandson  who always hated the shadow his grandfather cast  a shadow which most would see as a basking light to show them the way.  jealousy is an awful trait to carry with you all your life.
these show-runner guys say the right things but then dont deliver.  once you go full orchestra with the  wraycist  and  misiggynist  themes you cant go back.  we have memories and we remember what you called us because we objected to the destruction of a fantasy epic that was explicitly written to be an english mythology of our roots.
if true  then they should just not reboot it as it may just get worse  unless of course peter jackson is involved.
if they build on the first season in any capacity  it ll still be a failure.
only if they gave peter jackson full creative control  whether or not it could tie into the films idc just give him full creative control and do not question his decisions as he will be asking himself  what would tolkien do  enough for amazon. the hobbit movies  the hobbit  not lotr  were okay  they were just too long and dragged out and could have been one three hour movie instead and I blame greedy studio execs wanting multiple movies for that. amazon fired and blacklisted all the right people to do it  and let all the wrong ones control it as they ran it into the ground. amazon deserves this loss. they made a decision really bad for business  and deserve to feel the financial repercussions. hopefully they learn the customers are always right  or others watching their fall remember that instead. if the customer ain t right  you ain t gettin paid.
replace the showrunners  replace the writers and completely recast everyone ! the only way you can save this show is to go full scorched earth.
let s all admit it.  george r.r. martin is brilliant for releasing hotd at the same time as rop.  we are willing to forgive all his transgressions in not completing the books  letting them fuck up the final got seasons  and generally being a hobo looking dude since hotd is masterclass compared to the soap opera fanfiction rop series.
Im sorry I dont care what they promise to  do better.  they had zero respect for the source material. they had zero skill running the show. fix either one and the other remains  and they are both deal breakers. Im not buying their lies  Im not watching their show  they can gaff someone else. love ya melonie  keep kickin  prosterior.
I wanted to like this show.  too bad they wanted me to hate it.and making sauron the main character of season 2 and giving him the  galadriel treatment  means he ll be ruined and wrecked and made into a character that nobody even cares about.  way to sh!t your nest  amazon.
this is karma to amazon for disrespecting the lore to Lord of the rings.
its sad  bezos with all his money he could do a proper show that would honor tolkien s work  but no they had to compile this heap of manure...
I completely agree with you about rings of power  well - sort of. if they had introduced the show as an original show without trying to sell it as tolkien I could have actually enjoyed the show .youre absolutely entitled to have your own opinion about tomb raider.however I strongly disagree on your constant claims to speak for all tomb raider fans. I am a tomb raider fan and always have been since the release of tomb raider 1 in 1996 and I do not share your opinion on the new games. I like them. I like tomb raider 2013 a lot more than any of the old games.you dont speak for me when voicing you opinion on tomb raider and still you claim that  fans of the old games dislike the new ones . that is true for some fans. it is not true for others like me. and yes  I played tomb raider 1 on release day.ps  westworld season 1 and 2 are good. season 3 is still ok but diverges way too much from the original plots. I have not watched season 4 yet.
lol how does a amazon original  make money   its not like there are ticket sales. prime subscriptions cant be verified to be from the show....
they can reboot all they want. as far as Im concerned  the can go kick rocks. garry is right when it comes to me. you talk sht about the fans and you loose all your footing for present and future projects.
I hope so  but would have to fire everyone and start over  so... doubt it..
agree with the premise but the video misses the point  Im not interested in seeing further attempts by amazon or bezos after their attacks on the fans. itshould be equivalent to flushing the money they ve spent so far  and outside the cost of the cgI  you d struggle   same as musk and twitter.
I agree  halbrand was the best character.thats a little like saying thanos was the best character in the avengers movies. thanos was an interesting villain to be sure  but I think we all still like tony  cap  bruce  thor  starLord  and plenty of the other avengers too. probably more than thanos.so why is sauron the best character in rop because all the others are pure crap.if marvel had made all the avengers pure crap so that thanos was the one and only interesting character  that franchise would have been dead a decade ago.and yet  thats what rop did. and now its dead.
they had a simple task to use the source material... wish this happened to witcher series is well
I recently unsubscribed from a channel who started to defend bad robot and jj abrams  for their other work   in spite of said channel s disapproval of rop.   as a fan I cannot forget nor forgive what they did to star wars and star trek  two franchises I grew up with. .
toss another billion amazon. send the message about what happens when you go full woke.
what drives sauron  seriously  he is evil. there is no complexity  that is the beautiful simplicity of the Lord of the rings story  including sil  bout  etc. . melkor was a little sh1t and wanted to annoy daddy eru and threw a temper tantrum ever since and mairon got corrupted and became his first servant and after the banishment of morgoth he picked up where his master left off. dominate   subjugate is all it wants  there is no  oh  I have to make x amount of money so my family is taken care of when I die of cancer . he does it because he can and might makes right.if youre getting serious Bible vibes... ronald was a devout catholic  so yeah  there are some obvious parallels.
for me  its more like I couldn t care less about this series  other than being mildly ticked off  but not even remotely surprised  that the showrunners and actors went the usual route of attacking the fans as opposed to making them happy. they got what they had coming and what they deserved  and I have no pity for them. thats what they get for ruining arguably the most beloved fantasy franchise ever created  and they have no room to talk or complain. I dont give amazon my money if I can help it to begin with  so why should I give them a pass on this  even if they do reboot it  I wont watch it unless it does a complete 180 and actually becomes worth watching. that is all.
lol  they dont even get it. they shit the ip. there is almost no way to unshit the ip unless they find a way to undo what they did in the first place. they need to decanonize their mess or nobody will reward their behavior by watching season 2 no matter how good it is.
if they do cancel the show it would make my day. I would have loved a tolkien series that was actually tolkien but thats not what we got and it has been nothing but disappointment. even if the show wasn t using the tolkien brand it was just a horribly constructed show with terrible characters and writing.
but I thought they said they were going too leave when elon musk took twitter over !
still better than hotd.
halbrand as sauron may have been well executed  at least compared to the rest of the show   but it is such a poor storytelling choice imo. this version of sauron is not tolkien s sauron. tolkien was very black and white  good is good  evil is evil. we dont need a complex sauron. I dont want a complex sauron. also  I heard from a somewhat credible source that those hired to write rop had never read or seen anything lotr and were chosen because they had nothing else going on at the time. idk if thats true but it would make sense given the quality of the show haha.
bring in p jackson now maybe
what the showrunner wrote here tells me they aimed way too high and should have focused on a smaller-scale  character driven story. you dont have to make the story an epic prequel rehash of Lord of the rings.  just like that didn t need to be done with the hobbit  but they still tried.  we know what happens after. tell an interesting story thats true to the books.  or better yet  dont make the show in the first place. season 2  nah.
well just throw another 500mio and get peter jackson on board and call it a day
sorry but if we are choosing  then adar was the best character in rop by far... the sauron character is just a sad portrayal.
no one should be encouraging the writers by saying sauron was a good character.  they messed up the rings  story so as to make it both incompatible with the books and incompatible with the movies.  sauron was never in love with galadriel. galadriel was never tricked by him.  sauron was a giver of gifts  the gift of power infused into objects  in particular  not someone who taught basic metallurgy.  he had better lines to say. a competent actor played him.  halbrand only looks good because the rest look so bad.  that is all.  dont encourage the writers in any way. they messed up the way the rings were supposed to be forged and made their story incompatible with the rest of what we have already seen and read.
they tried to pass a turd sandwich as food and now know what counts as food and will do better going forward. no one would eat from them again thats my feelings on how much they missed the mark.
no forgiveness. no mercy.no one does tolkien dirty and gets away with it. they need to fire absolutely everyone and everything  and lock all of rings of power up and hide it from cinematic history. let it rest in forgotten eternal turmoil. only then will we allow amazon to dream again.
recast galadriel
I dont think the wokeness is really the problem for me. black dwarves dont bother me and strong women dont bother me. tolkien wrote plenty of very strong women. my problem is the complete disrespect of the lore  shrinking down the second age into such a short period of time is insane  the writing is just bad  hard to emulate tolkien.
the activists in entertainment are simply incapable of understanding how anyone would disagree with their messaging. why wouldn t fans want to see this ip updated for a modern audience  but of course they do  aren t they enlightened like me  fans on the other hand just want to be entertained and see the changes as low-talent appropriation of a greater work and intentional sabotage...which it is.there is no compromise position  only gatekeeping and reeeeeeeeeing. this only ends when the suits finally rise up looking for profits like the old days and purge these businesses of all this dead weight.
smaug  middle earth s first trans dragon  the reality show! coming fall 2023 on amazon prime!
I defy anyone to show where the ring of power series followed any one storyline from the books correctly.  they used a few names of people and places.  that is literally it.  they paid 250 million dollars to add clout to a wb level fantasy series.
hImelonie thoughts on the infamous games and ghost of tshunima
no one does tolkien dirty and gets away with it.    yet pj got away with wimpifying the  noble  wise  courageous frodo of the books and inventing an obnoxious scene where frodo believes gollum over sam and sends sam away.  then there s faramir taking the ring to get dad s approval  standing silently by while his men beat gollum up  gandalf hitting denethor and aragorn beheading the mouth of sauron.  all these changes violate the high code of honour that tolkien s good guys always demonstrate. but ok.
@philippa linton  frodo was a little dark  but I think most of why it feels that way  is we didn t see much of him in the shire.
jackson for all his failings  made grate movies out of a great set of books.
@eightbithero  actually  I dont dispute that.  I do love the films  and saw each one 15-20 times in the cinema. but my love of them is mixed with frustration.  they re great  but if pj had stuck to tolkien more  they could have been even greater.  all my criticisms are of the writing.  I dont mind omissions or changes from canon when they make sense. frodo s film characterisation will never not hurt me though.
@eightbithero  I dont mind frodo being dark.  he went through hell.  I just read so many comments in this fandom from people who think frodo was an ungrateful  useless lump and thatsam should get all the credit. they cant have read the book if they think that  and its a direct legacy of the films.  sadly.
@philippa linton  I think emotional turmoil is difficult to paint to screen without emoing it up. its easier to do that in a book where you can write about what the person is thinking.
@eightbithero  thats a fair point  and the films should show frodo s emotional turmoil.what I cant get over is pj cutting out frodo s more active  heroic deeds like stabbing the witchking on weathertop  defying the nazgul on his own at bruinen  and stabbing a troll s foot in moria.
its a funny rumor  but there s absolutely zero chance of this. none. zip. zilch. nadda. its like the theory thatstar wars was going to pretend the ridiculous sequel trilogy didn t exist and go off in a new direction. the rumor exists to make people like us happy for about fifteen seconds. studios dont function this way  though.
start by firing and blacklisting every person responsible for bringing this complete train wreck into being.  then  get rid of the actress with fewer facial expressions than darth vader.  get a creative staff that actually loves tolkien and go from there.
I tried  so hard to watch this show I gave up at episode 5
the people who make these things dont believe in objective reality. they dont believe there is a  good  or a  bad.  they think everything is relative  and the only reason we suffer now as humans is because people  not them  think the wrong things  and say the wrong things  thus contributing to the collective moral relativism thatshapes their own personal hell that they cant control themselves.expecting people like this to write any adaptation of tolkien s work and have it work is a pipedream of epic scope and magnitude. nothing amazon does at this point will save this attempt of their s from failure.
whaaat  what happened to  I can change him
Ive never seen a show go this bad that after season 1 they are already considering rebooting if we had to rate reboot or season disaster this is a nuke sized disaster
so wait - its almost like an insignificant .1  of the population that is woke somehow dont represent what the majority of people want.   its like classics are classics provided you dont signifcantly change what makes a classic classic.
never seen your channel before  but you seem a very sweet person  -
Im just tired of rich privileged superstars and excecutives telling everyone what is  right . even the most politically invested people I know are so tired of this now. spend all work hours  and volunteer to help society. come home and be force fed others opinions in every type of movie and media. yay!
11 40 nah  adar is the best character  aintnoway bruh
I liked the first season of the rings of power. I never seem to approve of the mass majority of so called fans of anything. Im surprised at the amount of hate it gets. its almost like most of you already made your minds up before it even dropped episode 1.
to honest if they  reboot  the series  their best bet is to bring the legendarium to life instead of political pandering.seriously there is an absolute goldmine of stories in there. all that is required is to stick to the source material. like there was a dark elf in there once  but the reason he s not in the main story is because he died the way he was....an absolute a-hole. no I am not kidding  look it up and he definitely was one.
pls reboot
something tells me the harfoots wont survive a reboot  or they could double down and have some lgbtqxyz characters episode 1
when you gonna be back on fnt
sure  whatever  let them hopefully fail again and lose even more money. I dont believe they deserve anything else to be honest. what s-his-face has enough money to finance 1000 seasons of rop  more like robbed  all by himself with ease. and if a reboot does happen  please dont forgot how dirty they did you before trying to make you forget the biggest l in film history for how heavy the name Lord of the rings weighs.  the actual currently biggest catastrophes in film history were all green lit by disney. what a surprise. will netflix be the next one to crash-land  the navigation system appears to have glitches  while the crew suffers from insomnia and probably hyperventilation  too.
as a writer myself I see that this also has to do with the way the british and americans approach writing and storytelling. Im an american but the english way of writing is somewhat superior to the american way. its true  it also shows on how we approach shakespeare  which was mentioned by the show runners  we become intimated by his prose because we in some way dont understand the choosing of his words  they re categorized as fancy or complex  which they are  and itshows only they really failed at it. they tried to use tolkiens british shakespearian style of writing using american ideals and views  thats not gonna work. one of the reason the marvel movies are a success is because they adhere strictly to an american view using american characters. audiences wont realize this much  but writers do  and when you see what they ve done to this incredible story tolkien wrote it really wanna make you cry  he really must be turning in his grave for this  this took him his whole life to do. and now because of a child like form of thinking  wokeness  it had to be turned into something different  these people are like children  I loved pj s trilogies  I think they re very well done  specially the first one  I have only read a little of the silmarilion because as a writer I dont want to be influenced too much by his work  my work has to be original  so o have not read it  but from what Ive read it is an incredible story  and to have people like the ones running the show ruining it is really frustrating. what are they going to do now    who knows  all I know is that they re going to have a lot of trouble trying to convince people to watch the next season.
I dont understand what does reboot mean to these people  like a redo
problem is the hardcore zealot  fans  and disrespectful hateful talk. the show was alright but nothing super awesome which lotr does deserve nothing but super awesome.
when she said reboot I said noooooooooooooooooooooo. then I stopped an went to the er
they had all that diversity shit in the story to begin with if they would have stuck with the story tolken told.  focus on the middle eastern people why they sided with sauron did they get screwed over by gondor.  I swear they make this shitso much more complicated than it needs to be. give us a new story within the context of the big overall story.  it doesnt have to be world changing race swapping.  the people who produce this shit dont stop to think does this make sense within the story that was already laid out.  I think that is why andor is doing well because it doesnt screwup the timeline and story of what is already known.  they had an opportunity to make something cool about the 2nd age and royally screwed the pouch.house of the dragon had pretty good source material with fire and blood to base it off of.  this amazon rings of power was nothing but a girl power show.  bezo s should have hired non woke writers who focused on a great story not diversity and feminism.  remember folks the force is female how did that work out for star wars.
as long as its a protagonist character  they will be a asshole. count on it. if they are giving focus to sauron  he will suck.
how are you spicier than pokimane without the nine layers of makeup she puts on
s1 was a huge disappointment.  to the show runners  fool me once  s1   shame on you.  fool me twice  s2   shame on me.  I ll pass on s2.
I kinda liked it..
only way I would watch it. invite back the tolkien professor scholar  expert and get peter jackson to either consult or direct a few episodes. acknowledge that it is a mythology created for a certain country and that therefore the demographic would be almost 100  white  except for the dark skinned races specifically mention in tolken s writings. other than that  they can be cast back into the fiery chasm from whence they came  a.k.a. go to hell.
I dunno about galadriel being the worst part   the harfoot story was pretty awful and vapid... just like that whole chemistry between bronwyn and arondir.  so much bad in this show.
I wish. but there is nothing but rumors. nothing substantial  yet..
if amazon reboots  turns little dwarf guyladriel back into galadriel  gets rid of the hobbits  the invented characters and recasts the non-ethnically-european actors  I would consider forgiving them and actually watching it. especially if they got rid of halbrand  pretended the  creation  of mordor didn t happen  and recast men to play elrond et al instead of the effeminate and insipid boys they have playing them now.but if they do the recast and keep the  girls can do anything the boys can do  atmosphere... screw them. I still wont watch.hire some freaking consultants that aren t necessarily tolkien experts  but are experts on traditional civilization like... I dunno... some amish men and women  maybe. or experts on western traditional cultures who actually like said cultures... almost impossible to find in 2022.
didn t they fire the only guy who had ever read a tolkien book
Im not a gamer -- I think it would be much more fun to write the code than to play the game -- but I am very upset at the horrendous distortion of star trek  star wars  doctor who  and comic books by kooks with a political agenda to push.
we didnt need 3 hobbit movies  and we dont need a lotr prequel series either. the lotr trilogy stands alone as the best tolkien-based movie series of all time.
like the reaction to  they want emmy awards  . the j. k. simmons s are you serious is getting old.all jokes aside they probably will win emmy awards but this award can not be more meaningless than it already is.
they literally made sauron the good guy and galadriel the bad guy lmao. remember that the entire Lord of the rings series is tolkien s own take on the Bible  he was a devote catholic. sauron is basically satan and they made satan look like a misunderstood good guy just trying to do the best for his people. Im not sure how much more extremist left wing that gets on top of the the entire movie being a walking talking bechdel test. you cant put tolkien s name on work you claim to be his when you invert everything about it.
maybe they should have had mark elias rig the views.
if amazon were capable of making a good adaptation of tolkien  we would have seen it this season. the only thing to do now would be to replace the entire production team  especially the writers and showrunners  and cast  and let a new team start over from scratch.
blatant propaganda about rop continues to pop up all over social media  an obvious effort to prop up the show and label tolkien fans as racist and fascist monsters. I find it difficult to believe that any meaningful reboot is in the works.
those people who say we re haters are just cringe
these politically correct woke people are actually religious people who are zealous for there religion. politically correct means that you are in agreement with your God  the state  think about it. the whole basis for this religion is power  total control over everybody and everything.   the lust for power is what I would name as the most evil affliction of humanity. people are taught that you can conspire to do many things  but not for power. why would it be taught that you are a lunatic if you believe in conspiracies for power  even though history books are filled with such from end to end. the obvious question to ask is  cuI bono or who benefits  obviously  it is those whe are conspiring for power.we may first observe that communism and socialism  which we shall hereafter group together and dub statism  cannot live with Christianity nor any religion that postulates a creator such as the declaration of independence recognizes. the slaves of statism must know no power  no authority  no source of blessing  no God  but the state. j. reuben clark evil cannot create anything new  they can only corrupt or ruin what good forces have invented or made. for nothing is evil in the beginning.j.r.r. tolkien the will to power  as the modern age from hobbes to nietzsche understood it  far from being a characteristic of the strong  is  like envy and greed  among the vices of the weak  and possibly even their most dangerous one. power corrupts indeed when the weak band together in order to ruin the strong  but not before. hannah arendt
they act like they are surprised about that  wtf...
a reboot  but critics loved it .. and those who didn t like it where officially labeled rancids ... even ign gave it a 10 10
disagree completely with the house of the dragon comparison. as well as defending quality  fandom and hating. how many house of the dragon videos does drinker have  how many episode reactions  how many breakdowns and recaps  like 2. how many does he have for rings of power  like 25. clearly  y all like to hate more than you like to praise.how many videos do you have praising and shouting out house of the dragon .... think about it.
I just want you to know that im not a simp  but if I would be one  I would be yours  and xray girls  but to the video  they would just reboot it and do the same exact mistakes so w e.
agreed I was disappointed alot by this series it was poorly written a very slow  I found myself getting bored. obviously the scenes were pretty but was to be expected for a billion dollars and even that could of been done better.
who is sareon
yep fire the writers and show runners all each and everyone and hire some older writers that know how to create a story. but really they want to get awards   they lost a billion and amazon has the patience wo allow them to receive awards    man they are dumb
what was his name.... gary  glen.... somthing with a g
nah  too much to ask. at least from the current writers.
source  true me bro - nerdrotic
hmmm  so the fans were right all along
they could always idk stick to the original
remember  they dont have the rights to the silmarillion  so they cant do the 2nd age properly even if they wanted. it is a lost cause.
what we got here is failure to communicate. some people you just cant reach.so you get what we had here over the last two months  which is the way they want it  well  they get it. I dont like it any more than you guys.
what I hated the most about show that character been written like marvel character not lotr  on top of that actors that do not suit the characters they play
well mac what are they going to do dress her up in wizard robes  it is just too late
reboot  they ll probably bring in jj abrams.
oh  there was a Lord of the rings series by amazon  hmm...  strange... guess I just didn t notice...
yeah  just like the rumours thatstar wars was gonna be rebooted after rise of skywalker.  these people will never admit to making a mistake.  they re ideologues and will only ever double down.
they cant cancel do to contract
throughout the show  we have a lot of time to learn a lot about the characters.  you know when there was even more time and when it would have been better to learn about those characters  before you started doing the freaking show in the first place!!! how can you hope to make a good show about a certain world or topic if you dont even bother getting to know the topic or the world
I first read Lord of the rings in 1962. yea. Im very old. thanks for stating the sad truth about the rings of power pos.
Im a good guy I hope that the show runners have a good job   earn good money to supply their loved ones. but for the love of God  never give them an employment as authors scriptwriters again lmao
you just wanna hate. you just wanna hate. no  we expect better. because we have already seen that better can be done for less money 20 years ago.
it wont work. they will hire different woke writers but they will be woke writers.
what is there to reboot  give it the boot so we can be done with it ffs
I dont trust them at all because we have seen this before they will double downsame showrunners   same boss  salke  same old ish
reboot  what s to reboot  its ruined from the ground up. the only thing that can be done is scrap the entire thing and particularly the writers and particularly the show runners involved. none of it or them are useable. they burned the audience well before it even aired and nothing short of a proverbial public execution of those behind this mess would even be humored by the audience at large. one does not simply get to stab someone repeatedly and then just act like nothing happened.
I heard netflix will be doing a gears of war movie   series   they fucked up so much legacies already
there was a similar rumor for star wars. I am doubting this rumor... but then again  rop did financially worse than the star wars sequels  sooo
rings of power at least has been beter than house of the dragons.
get woke  go broke
who else lured and trapped the creepy butler in the bathroom
I thought it was a beautiful mess.. I liked the house of dragons so much better
too little  too late.  nothing short of heads rolling and an apology for the abuse of fans would bring me back.
Ive got a crush on this chick
Im on a kind of useless cruesade where I dont watch shows when the producers actors attack the fans. I encourage everyone to do the same untill they starve.
team house of dragon
is that cara dune... ok hot.
it was never meant to be this bad.
amazon bezoed the adaption
doubt  people there are not thatsmart. rumors are just rumors
amazon..reboot...they should not touch lotr in the first place. they better admit that they kicked in the dark with rop and go back to selling stuff or something...because reboot might be even worse ....
ya you are speaking too soon.. no offense. theyl have an even bigger mess if sauron is the main character. this halbrand  sauron  Imean. firstly there s not enough more written about him to make him anymore 2 dimensional than they already tried todo. he appears in elf form to corrupt and once the rings are made he s off to being the dark Lord again and to make his own ring  rings. but hes not like a good guy or a antI hero he s fukn sauron. very evil person. thats the only way to write him. you cant have him be two dimensional which they already tried to get us to like him which is awful and defeats his own purpose from tolkien s work.
this sounds like damage control and trying to keep us from simply moving on. stand steady men  keep the original course! by the end of the fight the zon empire will know our names and why we came!
could have anticipated .... the fans told them day one what wasn t going to work. instead of listening to those fans amazon allowed this production to label them ists and phobes and ignore them. stop twisting old ip to try and make them appeal to people thatsimply never liked them. speculating on the chance you might get x more fans isn t worth it if youre losing x times thousands doing so.
they have to reboot it. they paid so much for the rights that they just have to do something with it.
like rise of skywalker fixed all the problems with last jedi.
now thats how you cook the books get a bunch of hacks could do a billion dollar show give them some side change and then youre writing all that offer taxes bro
algorithm bump
but have youread any black panther though
I liked halbrand as sauron
put peter jackson over it. he seems to be the only one who can do it
they could hire actors  screenwriters and showrunners next time instead of activists.
they make something good guaranteed money and dedicated viewership continue to make garbage continue to struggle and fail  its thatsimple really.
as long as payne and mckay are involved it will not change  they are arrogant to the point that they cant believe their wrong. can you imagine being on a road trip with those guys  hey were headed the wrong way  nonsense we know the way trust us were better than daniel boone  forward! east to alaska!  as they leave dallas  texas .
gary has some pretty bad takes and has  lied  about stuff he quickly and quietly ignores... Imean  I hope this is true cuz the salt is delish  but like... meh.
why does amazon turn everything they touch into crap   wheel of time  rings of power  new world mmo
anyone excited for s2  looks like cringe is back on the menu boiz!
they need to just stop..
u want ur show fail  easy  bring writers that hate the source material and have strong woke mentality
hey buttergirl!
galadriel very angry and male.
if they start by kicking any writer  director  and produced that has even a tiny fragment of left-sided politics or feminism in them  they might stand a chance.sick and tired of modern movies and shows ridden with political agendas. I hate it with a passion  and most people feel the same way.
they need to cancel the show. fully. not only that but wipe it off the internet. let it be forgotten as soon as possible.
cant believe that I have to disagree with you. the true fans really hate him.
love you
lets see if they will still use black actors as elves.
amazon better phone up peter jackson right now    ask him for help. otherwise  we dont want this series.
if they do  reboot  then in no way canthey make a worst final product than whatever shit this was.
as long as they keep the firstest female dwarf ever  ever  itshould be ok.
do youreally need a girl to read this for you  lol
hey it is bad reboot behind the production. reboot is what they do. badly.
the only way this disaster can be saved is to erase everything  apologise and start from scratch with competent people at all positions. it is unsalvageable because of two reasons  first one the show is total and utter trash  a mediocre school play. second there is no chance the people that they have been insulting for months will watch it as long as these idiots are running the show.
it does not matter now   I ll  not be watching it     I think ill re-read   lotr  instead
I blame the diners for my restaurant failing. everybody that eats there has only negative things to say about it and its not fair!nothing  no bells I swear hollywood is 17 kinds of brain dead.
I want it to burn after what they did to it.
nobody wants to watch Lord of the karen s for 5 seasons lol
forget it amazon  this is beyond repair! just fire them all and make a middle earth porn version full of celebrities doing nasty  nasty stuff... I dont see any other way to get some money back  since you lost both your investment and your credibility!
we know that bad shows can still win awards. most people acknowledged that hbo s watchmen series was bad. in plot  characters  script  all bad. but the show won a huge pile of emmy awards. why  because it gave the political message that the police and the country are racist.
companies who go woke with end up going broke. just watch....
reboot it    what like pretend the first season didn t happen    the more money they lose the better
there is no shame in emulating what is good let amazon consult with peter jackson
who hired these people in the first place
I dont doubt this could very well happen.  the first season was a total disaster.
think about what youre arguing for  female dwarfs with beards!  youreally want to see that
use all those millions to buy rights to the whole silmarillion.  then hire peter jackson and stay out of his way.
I just dont care for it anymore.
is that fake nails is itstick on or acryl
lol too late.
rumors  really  let me know when any of them are factual.
political messages in movies these days are like dick pics  seems like a good idea but ends up being a meme on the internet
its too late as far as I am concerned. reboot or not I ll never watch anymore amazon lor abortions.
if they bought the rights  they re going to continue making shows.amazon  listen up! please stop peeing in our eyes with woke intersectional garbage. a reboot with new peeps that rewards fans would be a good start.
talk about polishing a turd. they re sending a turd through a carwash.
I bet they saw the ratings on the peripheral. good show with a female lead and black co-star. seems like adults made this one lol
what happened I thought it was the most watched series ever   yea just like wukanda whatever is the best movie ever.  sorry Imean wukanda forever. God hollywood critics are so pathetic.
morfin needs to go  no matter what she cant be part of any of this going forward. you cant pay people to like her. my interest will go up to 2 10 points if I hear she is gone. some better writers that actually have a history of success. but no she has to go  she is lotr fan repellant.
hahahahahahahahaha!!!!!!
dems golden rangzzz!!!!
lmao a reboot how many years went by to earn its self a reboot. I thought this was gona be my way to get into this franchise.this is like a bad child you keep telling to stop it  this needs to die.following the news on this  this show is just in the wrong hands.
before doing reebot or whatever the f  k they wanna do   they should go and watch the series  1899 on netflix   thatseries shows what diversity looks like and how to not f  k everything with political agenda. they should focus on how to stay true to the characters from original source material.and for the love of God get rid of people who fu  ed the show with polictical bullshit.one last thing is  you dont have to cast weaker looking opposite gender to make the other gender stand out.
no no just give me your damn money bezos you cant mess up any more than you have just give me your money you clearly cant spend it right
does anyone else think that the rings of power season 2 is going to be shit like the first one if they make it
reminder  cancel your amazon prime subscription.
oh guys  you probably are already aware of these scammers pretending to be melonie  but do not contact that t l gram account as that isn t melonie but just scammers trying to steal your stuff. I see these scammers popping up everywhere with idiots at yt doing nothing about it except giving you a warning if youreport them. I already received a warning and a 24hr suspension after reporting these scam accounts. makes you think that yt is in league with them or something.
why cant all involved take the l and move on
reboot and apology. new screenwriters who will be faithful to tolkien s vision. no woke bullshit!!!
its not possible to fix canon breaking shit with the same shit writers they need to fire everybody and start with season one.
fire the entire cast  they were bad  and crew. start fresh. and stick to the lore
I dont mean to sound like a creep but by odin you are so beautiful.I guess I see myself out
house of the dragons destroyed all their narrative.
so does a reboot mean we are all not racist anymore
Imean... we are hurting for good entertainment  but the reason this garbage gets nominated for awards isn t so much because of a dearth of more deserving material  but due to most of the award-giving institutions being run chaired by the same kind of woke weirdos that make these awful shows  movies  books  comics  and so on.
yeah this will happen...  ...  like all those rumours about they making star wars trilogy again and erasing the last jedI from canon  sorry to say it  never gonna happen.
rings of power is a flaming bag of poop. amazon should step on it   put it out and go wash their shoe!
yeahh.... we are not watching it.
amazon gives this trash another season  but not  jean claude van johnson   thats some bad management over there.
Im a huge tolkein fan and I couldn t watch even 3 full episodes of this crap. turned it off about three quarters through episode 3. it was clear the writers thought Lord of the rings was only what peter jackson did in the movies  not appreciating the history of middle earth and its characters or they just didn t give a crap.
the smart thing to do would be to cancel it and replace it with a new lotr show.
amazon just needs to call peter jackson. even the hobbit movies were better than whatever rings of power was.
wokness that is what ruined the show.
didn t watch it before not going to do so after the revamp. they caused this atrocity and I want to see it fail
stop attacking your fans. just dont do it from day one fire any employee that does it
oh amazon  please just keep paying people to make your money losing flops  I just cant see the downside!
just let it phukin die. this gets a reboot but got seasons 7 and 8 dont
I still wont watch it
bounding into comics isn t that legit. they publish anything that pushes their narrative.
melonie  I dont think you d like to know that the advert on this video from  notonthehighstreet  explicitly mocks the Christian faith!it mocks people for  spending  Christmas  the day with Jesus.
they should just cut there loses and just make this none cannon and then hire actual fans of Lord of the rings to make a better show
bounding into comics  so in other words the story is bs.
everyone says this show is so boring  just assuming those same people find the jackson-movies entertaining  where I found it challenging to stay awake  I should stay away from this show  or I ll probably end up in a coma...
wish someone would reboot the walking dead series. thatshow went so far away from the source material and totally woke. got rid of rick grimes  really    smh. the excuse they used was making movies about him. I call bs on that one.
I refuse to watch the reboot along with anything else they make because of their gaslighting  emotional manipulation  name-calling  shilling and deleting of negative reviews  not to mention they only have the rights to the silmarillion and unfinished tales and they tried to pass this off as a Lord of the rings adaptation when they announced the show when it has absolutely nothing to do with Lord of the rings. I have no faith in this reboot.
12 50  it cant be worst .... gosh ! it can always be worst. did you hear  it is going to be an all female directors   and to this days  I have never ever seen any female directors being respectful to any source materials that implies a male hero or any form or male heroism. they hate it and only sully and destroy it for the sake of feminism and girl power. dont believe me   look at mary sue palpatine  or the witcher  they managed to spit on batman in batwhaman  and so on... the list is infinite as long it is a woman directing it. if there is something women are better than men  it is without a doubt  destroying men s legacy instead of creating something new and original.
annoys me they canceled making stephen king s black tower but wasted all that money on crappy Lord of the rings
lol
if you want so bad to make a movie about something that is not tlotr why yould you bother alienating everybody by naming it tlotr or calming it is related to tlotr xd
what if I told you that every failed tv series of 2022 was because one one person  this person had many names  and faces but thanks and behaves exactly the same. what if I told you  that jennifer  walters  she-hulk   jade whesker   resident evil  and galadriel were all the same person in disguise. dont belive me  okay  think about any episode of resident evil but this time replace jade with galadriel. the dialogue and behavior wouldn t change at all would it  you wouldn t even notice the swap. try swapping any of the main characters  from any of those 3 shows. they are interchangeable because they are  all the same person.
it wont happen they ll just double down give it an oscar s practically. and say that everyone who doesnt like is racist and sexist.
funny how for 20 years u didn t hate tombraider  just for the sake of hating even though its evolved and had new creative minds adding to it. so y would u suddenly hate it. it cant possible be because its now trash and creatively babkrupt. these ppl who criticize the fans and stand with trash entertainment r delusional.
for me helbrand was one of the whorst characters in this show so bad acted so bad written as the rest of the show on the other hand why even discuss what part of this show was bad I can say that 99  of it was complete garbage objectivly with no problem at all.
why are people who hate tolkien allowed to write and direct and act in the rings of power  amazon totally destroyed the wheel of time series with woke bullshit. so why should they change
yeah
if you wanted my support you shouldn t have called me nasty names. looking forward to this reboot failing as well
argh... its not  disrespecting .. disrespect is not meant to be used as a verb.  showing disrespect for . I know  I know  modern dictionaries will blah blah blah... they re wrong.
hahahahahaha
great news. finish of crap.
doesnt bounding into comics have a really shitty track record
honestly it would be the mature thing to do. admit the show sucked and call for a mulligan.
hail
will they dump  and publically execute  the showrunners  else rebooting is a waste of time.also  stop rewarding yes-men to shill your product. youre fooling no-one and its not doing you any favours.does focusing on sauron mean that we get a real galadriel  no hobofoots or not- gandalf these guys promised us tolkien and they lied. are they now to be trusted
comment for tomb raider
probably should have called peter jackson to do it from the beginning. but thats none of my business  kermit meme
I dont think you actually want it to succeed  because that would just mean less content for you  and youre having too much funyou haven t even watched breaking bad.... better call saul  .... got...house of the dragon.... nothin.... seen fringe  youre awesome  but you living in the past  girlie
Im sure the reboot will be excoriated by lefty fanatics.
it doesnt matter if they reboot it or not  it will still be shit.
but the seeeeaaaaaa is allllwwwaaayyysssss rrrriiigggghhhhttt
just let it die...  very few are going to trust hollywood to convert books to movie screens anymore.  rop  witcher  marvel  etc... hollywoods idealology has killed cinema   I d rather watch a bollywood movie now.
shows that this woke crap is not as popular as everyone thinks.poeple are sick and tired of it.
dont care. wont watch. cant trust them to make something decent.maybe I ll buy it cheap on blu ray in 4-5 years...if someone I trust tells me the reboot is good.
dump try to cash in on a popular series via even dumber fake news.
I wanted to watch it but I didn t because of all the politics surrounding the cast and all the negative hype around the butchering of the lotr vibe.
lol.  he s evil but complexly evil!  so prepare for a story about sauron crying when his boyfriend left him for a more toxicly masculine man and never being loved by his cis-heteronormative white supremacist father wearing a mmega hat
they need to get peter jackson
I have yet to watch any of this show. itseems pretty cringe from what I have heard and read.
hey  I like your content  but since half of your job is reading  you could do it properly
you are beautiful
am I aloud to say this show is trash and has no hope of succeeding.
hell yes!! reboot that heaping pile of garbage!now let me be clear having said that I have no problem with a diverse cast of characters but dammit do right by the books do right by the fans is all I ask and stop pushing a woke political message
but halbran is not sauron  Imean it is in the show but it isnt in Lord of the ring  hes just a human incel. he was the best of ring of power but hes still a turd wrapped in gold paper
third! haha
Im sorry  but u yanks misspronounce sauron al the time.. how so   u keep saying saw-ran...its sau-ron! plz get it right!
they made sauron an incel. instantly ruined. I couldn t find anything good from this show smdh
rings of power was the worst series I ever watched! no respect for the lore and just making elves dark with buzzcuts! thats just big no tolkien would be furious! shame on amazon
they are not rebooting. click bait. you just earned an unsubscribe.
not wasting another second on this trash from amazon.
Lord of the rings is as dead as star wars after this crap  just read the books folks.
first
I dont agree I think new tomb raider shits on old games didn t like them to each their own
we want an indian trans gender as heroine or  im not gonna watch it!
this article is bs. I dont like rop  but this article is just a lot of speculation without any trusted  source   I heard from someone who has a connect at amazon ....    I guess  the youtuber gary buechler of nerdrotic just wanted to get the views.
