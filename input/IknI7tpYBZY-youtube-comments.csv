the  major challenges  they re facing is the fact that they no longer make games that appeal to the largest demographic of people that actually buy and play games. what a challenge.
less games   less money   less profit   unhappy investors   change
its cool to see someone with integrity speaking out against the woke mob.. it would be soo much easier to take the path of least resistance..
sick of people just wanting to ruin people s fun. its gotten so out of hand
ubisoft has been breaking my heart since the assassins creed combat switch up. love your content! be blessed and keep killing it!
the problem is these people want to make movies not games  but cannot get into the movie industry.
dont buy the games. Im sick of companies pandering to the rainbow. money talks. if we stop buying games they pump out we can change the field.
ubi-soft was one of the first publishers to go woke many years ago. I stopped buying anything they made when that happened.
ubibI doesnt make games anymore and hasn t for a long timethey make stores with  recreational activities
this is why most games I play today are either 10  years old  or new indy releases.
Ive been a gamer for 30 years now  and I can say for the last 10 years at least I have grown more and more frustrated and disenfranchised with gaming  its definitely not what it used to be and I think its going to get alot worse before it gets better if it ever does.and its not just gaming every industry now has been infected with these people.
melanie  this hiring for identity politics and all this other stuff... is a much wider problem than what we just see in the entertainment industry. this has been growing issue for at least the last 5 years. there are most people coming out of college that wont be able to find a job  I spent 3 years looking for a job after college before I decided to go back to get my second college degree. but this is a major issue that needs to be addressed.
you said it yourself in your video  its a box ticking exercise now. movies  tv shows  video games etc aren t movies  tv shows  video games etc now  they are box ticking exercise.
the moment they anounced that the new splinter cell will be made for  modern audiences  it kill any kind of interest for me  it really sucks that they tried to make games for people who cant enjoy something just complain about it. keep up with the good content!!
pretty sure I saw this coming. when you raise kids on tablets and games that have instant gratification embedded in them  thats more often than not what they ll want  time and time again as they grow up.
I find it infuriating how often modern games start  playing  their cutscenes in the middle of the gameplay. its like  dude  Ive been mashing directional buttons thinking Im still controlling the game and it turns out the protagonist is just getting out of the trap on their own.
I agree a lot with the whole villains not being villains anymore I wish we could go back to having complex menacing villains that have no moral compass and commit horrific acts or even better let us play as the villain. not every game has to be for everyone.
Im 37 and have been a pretty avid gamer since the ps1 days. itseems like something happened around 2015-ish where games just dropped off in quality. maybe its the appealing to the common denominator or pandering I dont really know but there are very few newer games Im actually interested in anymore. rdr2 was the last one I really liked. Ive haven t even bought a next gen console because there s nothing out right now that makes me want to upgrade.
melonie is that person that plays the sims starting kitchen fires and erasing the exit doors sometimes I bet
its just probably really hard to create a game that wont offend someone somewhere. Imiss the good old gaming days. remember when it took 100 hours to finish a game because you couldn t find walkthroughs or cheats online
true that
well said. its like they dont want money anymore
its gonna be the most pay to win game ever made loll so I think they dont care about sells and reporting it
let s hope so
@now n den  now they jusy want your souls  or your childrens
okay but we ve been saying that for about 5 years now and... they re still doing fine. or at least they re still making this shit. they dont seem to care about not making money. thats the main problem. what do you do about a business that doesnt give a flying fuck about making profit  because obviously these companies dont. if they did they d actually make games for their audience not some imaginary modern audience.
@now n den  because they dont. they legitimately want to force you to think what they want you to. thats more important to them. the agenda is more important to them. they ve made that abundantly clear.
one thing is for sure  splinter cell will be woke in one way or another.  a black samantha fisher
I hate those accessibility features too.  they ruin the game.  especially when you turn them off you make itseem like youre playing the game not as intended  make it too hard and crippling.  you simply just cant turn all accessibility features off as the game was designed around them in many cases.for example the new God of war uses color cues.  that ruins the immersion.  and if you turn it off its too hard.
aaa video games is approximately 3 years behind hollywood  marvel  and disney .  the wokeness is just now infiltrating gaming in a major way.  thats why I stopped playing God of war 2 after the 2nd boss.  nice story and nice characters but the battle system is too corny.  accessibility and casual features like using color indicators to tell you when to block and dodge.I went back and played hades and discovered such a great video game.  its sad that I have to go play indie games if I want nice gameplay. and Im a videophile  I love graphics.
you forgot  eventually  at the end.
they are getting money from somewhere or this would of stopped by now.
@mamamob  I think its because low interest rates had them convinced they could invest for future growth with no care for profit. thats changed suddenly so they cant float pie in the sky ideas and claim they re for growth now
money comes from online multiplayer games
thing is I sadly believe the investors are in on it.  no idea why.  they seem to think woke sells well which is absolutely nuts    apparently none of them have heard woke broke.
if only it worked that way.dont worry they will keep making same looking games untill the collapse.
yeah that makes sense. matt mcmuscles
that only works if they even use investors  square enix  for example  doesnt use investors.
not necessarily. you can always minimize your costs if you make less products  eg. shut down servers  fire employees ...  and maximize profit from the products you end up making  setting high price  adding in-game purchases  tons of dlc and other scummy practices we accept on regular basis nowadays
@michael pun  ahhh what  wokeness in games goes way back. people were talking about it during a gamer gate.it may be just that movies have bigger audience and is harder to take over than gaming
look at ubI s investors  blackrock  vanguard etc. its all about that esg these days. somehow they have to balance getting a good esg score  and still make profit for said investors. even though its clear esg approved games aren t profitable. I dont get it  because they have such a small investment anyways  I say f em
@now n den  the games are obviously flopping thats why they dont have money to make games.
itseems like it doesnt matter how many times you explain to them get woke go broke they just cant comprehend it even when they start going broke
@chrono2959  its all about esg score
layoffs   more  money    less happy employees   more delays   more unfinished games. ceo s will still get their bonuses though.
its actually not easier. you ll find out if you try.
you know they hate thatshe s got the cred too.  in the gaming sphere professionally for  what   15 years now   longer   of course  that doesnt stop the accusations of  grifter  and such  but it does make it easier for us to laugh at them when they do.
@kevin carpenter  I have to agree with this.  seen more than a few people chuck their integrity in the belief  going along to get along  would be the right choice.  never works out.much easier to just be yourself  and if you know you at least a decent person or better  thats the way to go.
@the rotten    arent some of these people just being themselves then
misery loves company!
x defiant should be good considering they have the x cod pro aches helping them out
I hate those accessibility features too.  they ruin the game.  especially when you turn them off you make itseem like youre playing the game not as intended  make it too hard and crippling.  you simply just cant turn all accessibility features off as the game was designed around them in many cases.for example the new God of war uses color cues.  that ruins the immersion.  and if you turn it off its too hard.
@iammrpositive  because it keeps them energized.
@michael pun  skill issue lil bro  get good
@myeighty-nine  considering the statements made youre literally a sjw now lol.
@myeighty-nine  obviously are what  you just want me to shut up be cause your best counter is that you have a race card to pull black people can say racist crap like that too dude this channel likely agrees with that I am sure lol.
felt kind of like its soul was gone after ac2
@ur dad s favourite male escort  last one I enjoyed was brotherhood so Im kinda with you here!
yea.. no cap
black flag was the last time I really enjoyed assassins creed. sad af
Im still wondering if they ll go through all the major point in history or are they going to keep making us go through time thar we dont even care about.
I tried playing valhalla. that just didn t feel like an ac game and I just couldn t finish it.
cope harder
the franchise itself has gone woke  and become shit for other reasons
@andrew robb  you dont speak we. it was always about time travel. why do you think we explore history  lol.
unity  and syndicate sucked. at least origins and odyssey were awesome stories
no the problem is these people want to push an agenda not make anything.
its both
@mamamob  its both. people want to make movies  people have an agenda  and people want things as  mainstream as possible.
cough  neil druckmann  cough
well  there s that ac movie that no one talks about. I haven t seen it  but I heard that people were outraged about it. Im convinced that ubisoft is bankrupt in more ways than financially.
yep.  many are only in gaming now since gaming blew past cinema in becoming the largest and most profitable entertainment medium  not hard to figure out why .its hilarious to watch listen to those working on film tv adaptions of gaming ips with how beneath them they feel it is.  they dont even bother trying to hide it anymore.  yeah  big mystery why that medium is crashing at the speed of a falling asteroid.  if you want to brighten you day  take a look at disney s losses for 2022.  horrifying  for them .......yet strangely beautiful.......like a mushroom cloud
a major problem is that iq is droping fast. people are not smart enough to understand challenging gameplays  the new generation also has issues focusing on a task and just don  thave the mental ability to learn a new gameplay and develop skill. they wont tell you that.
sounds like david cage or neil druckmann. or even hideo kojima.
honestly I prefer a million times the current real time hack and slash like combat than the the counter attack sistem we used to have.the americas saga was literally pressing two buttons in an infinite loop. now you need real skills  its real combat.
@ur dad s favourite male escort  the sould of the game was gone when desmond woke up of the animus for the first time
@ur dad s favourite male escort  I thought ac4 black flag was a good recovery from ac3 but I have not bought into anything in thatseries since ac4 but for me the first one was the best one   I do enjoy most of the games they have produced like watchdogs  ghost recon and the far cry series up to 4
@gondorianslayer  I know its about time travel but I think its really dumb that they keep going further back in time rather than focusing on historical events after the american revolution and before you ask  unity doesnt count. Imean what s next for ac  ancient babylon
I prefer the earlier ones  but I loved odyssey ngl
they have been hit or misses for me origins was a great game odyssey was long and had no replay value in my opinion didn t even finish valhalla.
@ur dad s favourite male escort  no. the soul was gone since origin.
after origins its not rlly assassins creed just a game through history but maybe mirage will be good
@booming bob  I freaking hope mirage is back to its root.
@simon phung  they said that in the presentation and the fact they finally are doing a japan one is hope since they listened to the fans
@booming bob  isn t one of the mobile one japan  I know they are doing the chinese one
@simon phung  iirc the chinese one is the mobile sandbox game where japan s is an open world rpg
@booming bob  somewhat too late now. ghosts of tsushima beat them to it.
@zoloft77  yeah basically but you never know it could still be good regardless
hey  I welcome any and all risk taking in the gameplay department. assasin s creed was getting really stale so it needed a shakeup. you should have objected more to the garbage monetization instead. thats a lot more sinister...
@allan m. hanson  yeah  but all youre pointing out is your preference between two gameplay styles that a majority feel the opposite about.  considering the combat style you prefer is a 180 from the combat style the game was founded on  and even games name implies  there s a much stronger argument what you just pointed out is a detraction.  sort of like if call of duty changed from ranged combat to melee combat.  those unhappy with the change have the stronger argument  would they not
if you miss the older combat system  they said that assassin s creed mirage is going back to the original stealth gameplay.so Im looking forward to that. its been too long
@andrew robb because if they go forward in time it will get too modern.and they have always gotten fans who beg for certain time periods certain events after the us revolution just arent interesting enough and are too modern for their tastes right now.
@chandler burse  I personally dont care of its too modern. a game is a game  and I ll play it no matter what and I love guns. plus I want to see who might be a templar in recent history such as walt disney  or fast food ceos. and other shady people who are trying to destroy the world.
@andrew robb if it becomes too modern then whats the point  the point of the series was to be playing in both worlds or at least the past. if its like set on the 60s it might as well be set in the 2020s because how assassins work then will be drastically modernized as much as the 2020speople here are complaining about ubisoft changing the games for stuff and yet you dont care if they removed the entire theme of the series  is it really just seeing a pride flag that gets you people up in arms
@andrew robb guns are so fucking overdone in games dude
@andrew robb walt disney being a templar seems odd and strange since the man just wanded to make cartoons and build a weather controlled park.disney would be more like andrew ryan in that regard who is an objectivist conservative arguably.also are you implying you think walter disney was much of a problematic ceo as the current disney execs
@andrew robb yeah it be so fun to be a ceo and just sit in an office and form papers to make movies more woke or whatever.sounds like some heavy pandering to your guys side if it ever occurred and would be as boring as an actual woke game can be.
@chandler burse  its really boring to keep going back in time just to have the same plot line. I get it. the templars want to control everything and the assassins want freedom. they need to focus on something more new and yes  it needs to get more modern with guns and talk about corporate corruption. thats what makes the games more interesting.
@andrew robb  templars are not pure villains tho they should explore that more like with shay cormac. they want peace and ensure survival of humanity with order because they feel freedom only leads to chaos.both sides are never incorrect and I really hope you people didnt come into the games with a simple mindset of patriotic freedom and thought the assassins are purely the only good guys arguably they are arguably they are equal to the templars.it also depends on the assassin.the only thing I never really got or cared for was the religious Gods aspect of explaining away the creation. and they seemed to have dived too much into that in the later games
@andrew robb  the games are not interesting because its getting modern and to be fair the series was suppose to end with 3 and that wouldve been a better ending for the franchise than its current state I suppose although I loved 4.
I stopped playing assassin s creed after assassin s creed 3 because they change the controls nowadays I only play assassin s creed 1 and 2 occasionally three but thats it Im still upset that ubisoft fired the guy who actually directed the first two
@colin kiama  yeah the my said the upcoming games is gonna be either a mix or back to normal
@hyperion  I would prefer a mix of both
@deosilic  I d even say revelations since its basically the same gameplay with ezzio as the protagonist only on different region.
@kyle fortesque  yes. hideo kojima is infamous for making games that focus more on the movie aspect than the game aspect. also  since the ps3  quantic dream made games like heavy rain that were heavy on movie and light on game.
@the rotten    I just have to stop and savor that feeling for a moment every time I think about what disney has done to itself. I cant think of a more deserving company.
ubisoft doesnt make movies their games dont have a problem with cinematic themes it has a problem with being bug free playable and nice to look at and actually succeeds the quality of their previous entries
@gabriel thats why we love kojima because how he does it is some good crap.
the video game industry makes more money than the movie industry though.
@mamamob  nailed it.
@backintime alwyn  chicken and egg problem.
it would have stopped years ago if people had principles.
yo ho ho and a bottle of rum. referance   shame they dont do demo s anymore
buy a Bible  lay in bed  start praying lil bro  it ain t happening anytime soon
Im starting to think youre right  haven t really played a lot of ubI games until recently  but after finishing far cry 6...its tiresome with all the preachy characters that are totally implausible as leaders of...anything! monteros being the exception.
assassin s creed revelations was a special kind of terrible.
ubisoft is one word
cries in far cry
saints row has gone downhill as well  I was distraught for weeks with what that franchise is well.
meh  I dunno. far cry 5 made the wokies cry because it didn t paint gun carrying patriots in a baf light  not to mention watch dogs 2 making a non-binary character a villain
the only real contribution that ubisoft has made to the world was giving us the modern yankee doodle with keep your rifle by your side.
@beregond  oh old far cry how Imiss u
the diference from watch dogs 1 to watch dogs 2... its like they took a woke pill before making wd 2. colorful game  cartoonish characters  dumb humor  rainbow flags all over the game. I am glad ubisoft is getting the famous   get woke  go broke.
yeah with every release their games become worse and worse
what do cancelling games games have to do with being woke  my guess sony  sega  konamI  capcom  snkp  and even treasure were being woke when they also cancelled games.cancelling games is a result of market reality  i.e a realization that the cost of development isn t worth it. the world going through tough tough economic times and stuff like this should be expected.
@liam wynne  and then they shit the bed with 6 and the whole  success doesnt come in our color  crap. not to mention the game is bland
@paul  I hadn t played dead space until a few years ago. even though I have a weak spot for the o.g. halo s  dead space is still easily one of the best space-set sci-fI titles ever made.      these companies like ubis0ft and  . . really did used to make some amazing titles. far cry 3  assassin s creed 2 and dead space  those are timeless games! but now they re lucky if fans even look their way these days.
@liam wynne  I haven t bought f.c. 4 because it looked really g  and didn t like 5  cause it looked like it made light of america s true values. what would you say is far cry 5 s best qualities  is it worth picking up
@beregond  I dont know  I dont know what you mean about 5 and its true values
damn far cry use to be good
@beregond  far cry 5 is a bit of a mixed bag  but you might find it worth a look.its very pretty  of course  and features the usual far cry blend of repetitive fetch-quests and wild over-the-top action set pieces.  the story is sometimes contrived  but has some truly great moments.  the characters are interesting  and the villains are quite compelling and memorable.  the music is fantastic.  and  perhaps most surprisingly of all  its portrayal of gun-toting rural americans is generally sympathetic. the one thing I would caution is that the ending is atrocious rug-pull garbage.  its not so much woke as nihilistic  but I hated itso much it tainted what was otherwise a really enjoyable game.
@lone wolfsbane    it was hyphenated before.
@liam wynne    that doesnt make sense. if they weren t woke  they wouldn t even have a  non-binary  character for any reason other than to point out how ridiculous it is.
@gloria thomas  really  its kind of the most basic component of business.  a.   of units soldxb.   profit per unit c.   profit made to be reinvestedif a or b suffers  you have less for c.  in this case  they screwed up a  with ubisoft making a number of products that alienated a portion of their regular customers  who then didn t buy.
@jay sullivan  in 2003   ubisoft was written as one word. get with the times  boomer
@beregond I thought 5 was very good myself. the seed family are my favourite villains in the whole series and the music is amazing.
@lone wolfsbane    nah  I ll stick with the better times  when everyone wasn t a soft coward. you-be-soft.
@coyote one  I feel pretty much the exact same way about the end of assassin s creed unity. great gameplay a while after launch and wonderful combat  but a trash nihilistic ending too.
@lone wolfsbane  wind s howling
@jay sullivan   when everyone  that includes you  wasn t a soft coward
@jay sullivan  but they kinda do  though. also just having a non binary character alone doesnt make something woke
@rambleon07 people love it now mostly due to ezio
@liam wynne it did actually show stereotypes of both sides I am pretty sure since I remember one character literally just randomly going on a huge hillbilly rant on gun laws and obama care  its odd for any game to mention a real president to be fair
@rafael galindo wd2 was much better tho it didnt feel super woke it just had a weird cringe feel with the younger cast. the first game also explored corruption in a system so it makes sense certain elements would be brought up for the next which focuses on the group that is against the corruption as a main goal.legion was terrible.2 was the most fun to play in my experience story isnt great but people didnt think 1s was great either until recently when everything that use to be considered average is now considered amazing like far cry 3 and days gone.
@rafael galindo you do know san francisco is considered like the center for the lgbt  the areas of the city with those flags look almost exactly like that. they were simply being accurate to a 2016 sf. why do people see this and lose their minds  its in the history of sf its just how the city is who cares  I loved how accurate sf was. chicago in the first game is argued over for being so bland and even odd for chicago.they did one great improvement and that was the map.legion also threw that in the trash.
@beregond ea didnt make dead space or mass effect they were publishers I doubt they had anything to do with most of the development. they knew who to pick for developing them is all.
@rambleon07  actually  revelations was pretty much the peak of ac gameplay. the story and characters weren t as good as the previous two games  but I didn t think they were horrible either. the main problem with revelations was its modern-day sequences with desmond. absolutely horrible. there was one other fumble but.. at least it was assassin s creed back then and still had a little passion.
@matthew lyman  far cry 6 is one of the blandest games I think Ive ever played
@chandler burse  true  but games journalists were upset that it didn t just make fun of the one type
@liam wynne  I do believe the game had a message about religious extremism and how stupid people will be when they have a lack of doubt and rationale in their faithbut it kind of screws that up with the ending albeit new dawn retracts that and says joseph was wrong and realized he killed innocent people for bullshit he made up himself.
@coyote one  new dawn kind of retracts that ending with its joseph seed plotline.and generally far cry games are kind of nihilistic at least 3 seems to be preaching that message sometimes and 2 definitely has something with thatsince the protagonist dies no matter the ending
@beregond  you didnt buy 4 because pagan min set off your homosexual meter eh he is bI but he is one of the better characters in that damn game. he is as praised nearly as vaas was
@jay sullivan  6 may have one but 5 doesnt as far I am aware
@chandler burse  interesting take.  I have new dawn but I haven t played it yet.  I feel like I should give it a shot at least.I didn t hate the fc5 ending for being bleak  I assumed a bleak ending was in store since thats the far cry style.  I hated it because it made everything pointless.
@coyote one  its whatever its as enjoyable gameplay wise as 5 I guess but its nothing great it kind of feels like ubisoft needed a filler game and copied fallout for some reason
@coyote one  I hated it because it implied joseph was right. I like new dawn at least for correcting that but thats all I know thats decent about that game storywise
@chandler burse  if you have such a problem with america  why dont you leave your reply up which spits on it  if you got your britches in a knot over our ideal ability as citizens to defend ourselves against tyranny  then why dont you own up to your words
@beregond  I dont know where I spat on it the dude I replied to said that he didnt want to play far cry 5 due to it insulting americas true values when all the enemies are gun toting maniacs and cultists unless thats what he thinks is americas values then no.
@beregond  also the overused  why dont you just leave is so dumb there isnt really any other country one would be any happier in its also perfectly fine for a person to not like their country so much. Imean you people are always on these videos complaining about the us in some fashion but claim to love it and that makes a difference I guess its called freedom of speech and belief something america does hold as a value so whats the point of being free here if a person cant even dislike the nation in some way or many ways  and express it freely
@beregond  own up to what words also whats queer bate also moral  being gay immoral is a subjective thing not objective personal beliefs aside if one thinks that a person just being gay is immoral without pride or anything else involved thats more of a them problem then the other person just living their damn life.another great thing about this nation is that due to actual freedom people should be allowed to be freely gay.whether or not pride parades are gross I get arguments thatsay they are gay people in general are a different boat.the problem with freedom is people want different freedoms mostly people are selfish and seem to want freedoms that only befit them and their lifestyle but dislike freedom for others.on the other hand too much freedom can be a bad thing since as scholars claim absolute freedom would be chaos.and truly I say morality in this nation isnt decided upon by religion or personal beliefs.more by laws.of course morality objectively I always felt does stand in the way of pedophilia and rape and murder and should always legally. but homosexuality despite what you or others may believe doesnt count in thatsection.just as much as the large amount of pastors who have been molestors doesnt make Christianity count there either.generalization isnt good in that way.
@beregond  ok Imisread I thought my reply is still up
@beregond  I dont remember making any other reply thatsaid such.I also confirmed Imisread it.
@beregond  morality is arguably subjective dude thats literally something humans debate and differ in all the time.thieves for one arent gonna have the same morality as you or i.soldiers may also hold different morals.racists also differ.sexists as well.left and right people do as well.Christians to other religious people formulate their morals on their beliefs I know as a Christian myself but even then we differ in that regard
@beregond  white city  what are you talking about
@beregond  is this just a joke about my profile pic
@chandler burse  no worries. I dont subscribe to the expectation that all thread participants are required to read in full  and I wont claim that you are required to read through the whole thing either. however  your spiel about qu  r-b tes and america was still more than enough to go on.
@beregond  you are beginning to make less sense than you already did halo player.
@beregond  what I said about america is just well the truth.itstrives on freedom so its better that way.
@beregond  dont get what your problem with me in the first place is even.I have no idea what I said about america before all this in this thread.
@beregond8771  aye hell yeah man! spit the facts! Imyself also have a really soft weak spot for old halo better days...
@paul  I couldve sworn the halo comment thread was on a different comment.
@chandler burse  haha yea
yup  it has ruined their once amazing reputation for making good games
@melonie mac go boom  thank God Im not the only one who couldn t stand tlou games  uncharted series  or any of the other games that are little more than interactive movies.  if I cant skip past cutscenes  I wont play it.  I play video games to  oh idk  play them   weird concept  I know  but if I wanted to watch a movie  you know what I d do   rhetorical question .worse is a  good story  is the easiest way for a developer to not only cover up shortcomings in gameplay  but to ensure a small army of rabid fans will defend the game on their behalf from anyone with even the smallest objective critique.
@the rotten    uncharted is more gameplay than cutscenes.
@the rotten    this is literally every fandom.resident evil games are like this. especially if one says crap about the originals or 4 especially.silent hill 1-3 is defended vigoriously now even 4 is.fandoms run on love for a game but they also get life from hating people who hate the games they love.I know I am sometimes one of them.at least I am when it came to arin hanson s dislike for 3d zeldas oh disliking ocarina or majora may get you murdered literally I wouldn t doubt it has happened.
same
Ive predominantly played fighting games these past few years if Im playing at all. fighting games are always there when you need an actual game and want to get your ass kicked.
@kilo  I have yet to win a single online match on street fighter
from soft games   dark souls   sekiro   eldon ring   are great and not woke.  also they are super hard.
@mad dog gamer  it be like thatsometimes.
same.  only aaa game I bought and played this year was elden ring....oh  and spiderman pc  but that falls in a weird space of being  new  yet  old .  everything else was aa or indie  and what I experienced was so encouraging that I no longer worry about aaa ideology  p2w  mobile games  or really anything aaa related.  that whole segment could disappear tomorrow and I saw enough this past year to know gaming wouldn t just be fine  it would ultimately be better off.I cant encourage anyone enough that if you dont like a dev pubs politics shoved in your face  or you see mtx p2w gacha mechanics  or a game launches buggy or broken  or even if its simply not the game they promoted it to be  stop supporting it.  and by  it   Imean the developer and publisher as a whole.  it isn t about knowing they wont go out of business even if we all followed this tactic  its about market share  and that we can have a major impact on!  every dollar the scummy aaa industry doesnt get and a aa indie does  shrinks the aaa market share  opens space for a more driven and passionate team  and funds that team to make something even better than they otherwise could ve. ubisoft cancelling these games is exactly what Im talking about  and will have numerous positive ripple effects on the rest of the industry.  I was stoked when I saw the news because this is finally a win for us core gamers who ve hated watching what has become of our favorite hobby.  we only lose if we feel its already lost.
I just stick with monster hunter  rpgs  and nintendo. so basically  japanese games only.
@aninymouse  the only scene in the west I know of to be still in good spirits right now is the indie shooter scene. doom 2016 made retro shooters cool again so there s a number of titles like dusk  project warlock  selaco and there s some other stuff thats taking it to extremes like get to the orange door. gmanlives reviews pretty much all of them since he s a huge shooter fan in case if anyone s curious. from my personal experience  dusk in particular is a great title  project warlock looks great and plays so too but its not all that challenging.
@kilo  youre probably on the right track  I just dont play fps games anymore since I just play on console   double analog stick is not my thing. in monster hunter  the left stick just controls the 3rd person camera  so you dont use it constantly. I actually liked fps better with the weird n64 controller  when you had hard buttons on either side and the analog stick in the middle. I played a ton of goldeneye   perfect dark  doom 64  etc.
when the corporations came in outer worlds from obsidian was a warning
what s ironic is they say the exact same thing because our creators make things we actually want to buy. they accuse eric july of ticking off boxes because he makes a product his audience wants to buy. they legitimately believe that artistic expression means making something no one but they like and still forcing someone else to buy it.
if you want to understand what s going on youre going to have to watch yurI bezmanov
@mamamob  thats kind of what capitalism almost is. often filled with advertising for products that either suck or are just too complex to use rather than a more conventional method.thats why people who bought snow cone makers and soda stream ended up throwing them in their cabinets for 20 years.
I was concerned about what you just said  along with all the p2w aspects of gaming and where it was all headed  but much of that got put to rest this past year for me.  not only the success of elden ring showing there s a market for challenging combat and an open world that doesnt hold your hand like a toddler  but also the aggressive jockeying for position of a quickly growing indie development scene.  for every ubisoft that goes woke or every blizzard thatshifts to p2w  there are hundreds of talented indie devs just dying to fill the void.....devs who still have passion for what they do and often give two shits about ideology.  4 of my top 5 favorite games this year were aa games or smaller.  so there s hope!
ubisoft games lack any gratification to me
games are already cited in general for being instantly gratifying in a way that causes people to dislike real life and actual achievements though like this isnt anything just from newer tablet games and games being easier.games in general give people a easier gratification than real life does.
@the rotten    but when you have no pc indie devs are hard to even buy products from.like me albeit most of the games I own new or not I like and I dont give a crap what people want to say about them if I at least enjoyed them
@chandler burse  I dont console game  but you guys didn t have access to games like stray  neon white  tunic  metal hellsinger  signalis vampire survivors  etc
@chandler burse  also  if youre on xbox  you have more access to indie games than ever before with gamepass.  not only does it  count  for the devs whenever someone downloads one of their game through gamepass  but you ll for sure find a few you like that you canthen purchase digitally.  bc of gamepass  I  experienced  well over 60 indie games last year all for free  besides the  9.99mo subscription   and ended up buying 10 of them outright because I liked them so much.
@the rotten    not xbox
@the rotten    this sounds like an ad.I dont trust you
@the rotten    I doubt I have any interest in those games
I feel you on that
Im 35 and yeah ps1 is awesome. I even bought an actual system and started collecting again! I agree basically when the xbox one ps4 was launched everything then onward really felt souless and greedy and preachy.the 360 ps3 era started some nasty trends but still had some semblance of heart and soul in the games made. modern gaming sucks ass  is full of microtransactions and sjw lbgtq propaganda. gaming isn t fun is designed to be greedy addictive and boring at the same time. psychologists are hired to make the most addicting microtransactions mechanics possible.
@wade dewell  I haven t played ps1 in forever but parasite eve 2 was one of my favorites
it didn t help that 8th gen had such a rocky start. in terms of fpses destiny was perhaps the biggest disappointment in at least 10 years when it launched  and a lot of devs started to get the idea it was okay to release a barebones product and just add more as they went. I dont need to even speak of how badly the master chief collection failed on launch  and that could have been the penultimate experience for the 10 million halo fans.halo 5 had effectively nothing to show on day 1 and only started to feel like a complete experience by about a year into its release with all the updates. and it really sucks because it was the first time we finally got a custom games browser and with the forge mode being so sick there was so much good content to play but the player base had whittled down immensely by then.titanfall 1 was probably the best out the door but it felt like an incomplete package and luckily the dlc maps rectified some of this  but it never shook the feeling of being a beta with the lack of a real campaign and very little in terms of customization. great gameplay  at least  but man you could burn out on that game fast because modes like attrition were just designed to stimulate adrenaline reactions with how crazy it always was.and then there s battlefield and cod  which I stopped playing cod ages ago but no one was really happy with blops iiI  advanced  or infinite warfare  you shouldn t skip the campaign on that one though if you like scifI  and no one was really happy with a release until the new wave of modern warfare by all impressions Ive seen. battlefield fared much better between 4 and 1  too bad its been awful lately.
couldn t agree more since ps4 gaming been slacking I been waiting to buy next gen but still waiting on just one good game
@kilo  I actually played through the master chief collection a few months ago. playing 1-3 brought back alot of great memories. I stopped at reach. I tried halo 4   when it originally came out and tried again with the master chief collection but I still couldn t get into it.
@tablet 2  Im still on xbox one and honestly there was only a handful of games I even liked with this gen.
@rockosdogspunky  halo 4 does have its issues  the aI are a bit dumber less sophisticated than previous entries which is why the covie dont seem to be as challenging as foes and the promethian enemy types are bullet sponges  they were rectified in 5 but they are definitely annoying in 4 with their lack of any reaction to getting shot. the only mission in 4 I thought really hit the mark was the one on the space station with the composer  that felt like a classic bungie era mission. the other problem is that 4 defaulted too often to a  hit 3 switches to continue  loop. pretty good for a first-time takeover of an ip by a new studio but yeah  not everyone s cup of tea.
@kilo  I definitely fell into the  not my cup of tea  crowd. Imean I didn t hate it or anything like that it was just kinda  meh
@rockosdogspunky  hopefully 2023 is good
killed that darn clown
meh  me and my brother would go much further than that on the original sims all the way back in the 90s  as we d make a new sim family consisting of a single member  typically named after somebody we didn t particularly like at the time  and would build them a shack with a whole bunch of flammable furniture and a phone to invite the rest of the neighborhood over for a party  not to mention the infamous fireplace and when everybody was inside  we d delete the door and light the fireplace and watch as all heck broke loose.yeah  we were a couple of little monsters back then  though the two of us turned out to be quite nice and caring as we got older  so its all good.
@jolis parsec  so yourecognize  killed that darn clown  lol the stupid clown that would show up if somebody died and would teleport out of the room if you tried to burn him. if you did manage to kill him with fire  it took a snapshot of him with the caption  killed that darn clown
@aaron p.  the tragic clown  pretty sure you had to have one of the expansions for him to begin making a physical appearance in the very first sims  though his portrait was already in the base game so I could very well be mistaken.I always avoided him like the plague since my friends told me that if you kept insulting him  one of your sims would wind up getting murdered in their sleep by him later on  though I dunno if thats true or not since I never wanted to find out.
Im one of those.  there s some really creepy stuff you can do with a pool when the points of exit entry are removed.... I have a theory that those who embrace being evil in a game only do so as its a drastic departure from the decent person they are in life.  those who dont understand the appeal of playing a game as the bad guy is only because they are plenty bad in their actual lives.  repeating their personality in a video game seems tedious and a pale imitation compared to living it  while playing the  good guy  is such a departure from the norm that its the more novel and interesting option.
who cares if people get offended  a lot of y all just too soft nowadays
a game is not meant to be for everyone  there is a reason why games have ratings.
thats why you just make the game and not care about all these little wokies feelings.
@lexcore corp  oh Im not offended easily and Im a proud conservative  the problem is ubisoft is also a canadian company in montreal. in the past years trudeau gov put out a bill that for instance  if you miss gender someone on purpose  offend a trans person its now a crime and you can go to jail.its now considered a hate crime. companies have no choice but obey this new set of rules. its more complicated than you think up here. we lost a lot of our freedoms of speech.
@fritzchow  ubisoft is aslo a canadian company in montreal. past years the trudeau government put in laws that we cant miss gender or offend anyone on purpose anymore. its considered a hate crime and it means jail time. companies up here have to obey to these rules which is why everyone up here now has to walk on eggshells. I quitsocial media two years ago if not I d probably be in jail myself
@fritzchow  yet no one ever gave a crap about those ratings did they  how many of us played m games as kids lol
there was a dos game back in the 90 s that I loved called normality  I never thought for a second that its goofy plot would become a reality in any way but here we are.
same deal. went back to some of the classics like the original xcom and was thoroughly impressed despite its age and quirks. modding makes it even better and some total conversion mods completely transform the game. its incredible. honestly  if I never played another good modern game in my lifetime  I d be content because there s so much good shit out there to play and replay.
Im with you man  Im 29 and been around since the ps1 days too and I find myself playing less games these days whereas back in the ps1  2  and 3 days there were a ton of great games to play and a lot of variety  today there s nothing Im interested in and everything just looks like the same game. I have a ps5 basically because I wanted to play gran turismo on it and a few other games  but I only have like 4 or 5 games and I barely even touch it anymore. Im back to play rdr2 now and racing simulators with my wheel setup because thats always fun for me.
its because of microtransactions and pandering to wokies. they figured they didnt have to make the best game to sell a bunch of copies but just ad microtransactions and the people that play will spend more money
@james g  honestly there s been a couple of times Ive been tempted to get a next gen console just to see how great rdr2 looks.
@hyperion  I know what you mean. Ive been back on skyrim recently. Im doing a playthrough without mods but after I finish this one I will probably mod it  as much as one can on a console  and give it another go.
only got a ps4 a few years ago. I dabbled on games here and there  but in the end I only own three games because most games do not grab my attention like it was with every other console I owned like the snes or ps2. I am in no rush to go ps5 even if it was available.
@aegiskhaos  I dont think we ll ever get the sheer amount of great games we got in the ps2 and original xbox era again. thatsucks but it was a great time to be a gamer.
I dunno I thought 2017 was a pretty great year  specifically for jrpgs. 2019 had a bit of resurgence too with some smaller games.
@wade dewell  mgs1 was fairly preachy in its day too
@wade dewell  fighting starbucks dont woke people like starbucks what  the parodies you guys come up with are far more ridiculous than what we actually get
@wade dewell  meryl isnt a very good character in my opinion.not to mention despite the fact solid snake isnt gay really have you seen the amount of fans who love to pretend otacon and him have some serious gay tension there is well that one weird scene in 1 thatsnake acts weird towards otacon its odd.big boss on the other hand is potentially bI considering that kazuhira miller date mission in peace walker.ocelot is some kind of revolver sexual and has a thing for big boss itseems.the series is gay enough sometimes
@wade dewell  I said mgs is preachy not woke like today.it literally preaches about antI nuclear war  antI war and antImilitary messages all the time. its basically the theme of the seriessame as bioshock preaching sort of about antI capitalism and such
@rockosdogspunky  not very different  I dont think they enhanced it  not that it needs any enhancement though  itstill blows my mind how good it looks. if you want proper visuals better than last-gen then get the pc version and max it out  if you can .
@james g  at the moment I cant but I have a friend thats been trying to get me into pc gaming for a minute
this doesnt bother me.ubisoft  electronic arts have already angered me to the point of simply blacklisting them. I dont have an isp. I cant do an update that is more than 2 gigabytes- and their games range between 10- 50 gigabyte updates to repair the game from day 1 releases that are broken alpha builds.I am sick of it. I am done with pretending that their purpose is to do more than micro-transaction people into bankruptcy  and butcher their own stories from day 1  purposefully creating crappy day 1 releases that never had access to the whole of the content to begin with because they planned 1 3rd to 1 2 of the game to be released across multiple dlc  expansions .  edit add  and 90  of the in game items are the microtransactions.
gen x gamer and grew up playing the good stuff  but the past several years Ive been a sucker for a really good  immersive rpg  fallout  dragon age   but there does need to be a nice balance of story telling and gameplay.  if its too easy  I get bored.  so yeah  I play the same old games over and over because the new stuff just isn t cutting it for me.
agree with everything said here. happy you brought up the points about God of war too cause I bring up the same points to people I know and I get told idk what Im talking about  hopefully the industry goes back to what it was and starts listening to its actual fans
two points I agree with 1. most video games focus less on gameplay  demo release and game testing.2. the focus has shifted to fancy video editing this means the higher ups not the devs put more money into cinematic trailers taking away precious resources from the devs themselves.the last game that had actual gameplay in their trailer was metro exodus. ark 2 is just one example of a hyped up cinematic trailer which I wont be buying early till I see some actual gameplay.
dang  melonie... you ve been cracking out fire video after fire video lately! and you ve been dropping the truths that people need to hear!the late  great charles spurgeon once said   truth is not to be hushed up  but proclaimed.  and Im so glad thats what youre working hard to do. keep standing up and speaking out  melonie! the Lord bless thee  and keep thee  the Lord make his face shine upon thee  and be gracious unto thee  the Lord lift up his countenance upon thee  and give thee peace   numbers 6 24-26 .
love your videos melonie!!! you make this crazy world we are living in worth it!! also this  modern audience  they keep referring to does not exist. the audience hasn t changed  its just people are so sensitive.
they have killed so many of my favorites  I hope no-one ever sells the rights to a game to them in the future.r.i.p nightmare creatures.
just saw this story this morning. glad youre talking about it.
video games   help!  they re turning us into simulations with no challenge and pretty images!visual novels   I ll kill  em!
having worked on several ubImtl projects  I cantell you exactly what s going on.ubImakes game with payroll devs. game looks beautiful  doesnt work. ubI flies american server scaling and security devs to fix problems. game works. for honor multiplayer was one that I was hired to unfuck.present day  no jab  cant get into cucknada. american merc devs tell ubI to get bent. ubI cancels projects because canada cant into math. simple as.
Imiss the days where I had to get my dad to rebuild controllers cause I snapped them in half or crushed them cause I lost to a very hard but great game. I would go on to beat it but yeah Imiss those days. or the games that literally lost you friends face to face cause no online existed back then.
Ive never heard of skull and bones but I hope for those who want it that it comes out. but ubisoft has been stepping in it for the last few years and its why I haven t spent a dime on there games  I know its not fair for those developers  but when it attacks my values I cant support them.
damn  I started playing video games back when the colecovision was around. I agree with most if what you say here except the God of war critique. both my son and I find combat in the new iterations much more fun than on the originals.
I usually play the game as the neutral good guy and then rerun as the bad guy but never finish the bad run. goes  too much against my core values even though its a game. just loved that option. either way its all fantasy in the mind and thats what Imiss in new games.playing allot of older releases atm
weell  glad to see you more focused again on games. did not 3xpect ubisoft  s bashing so soon  as their latest games have been trying to add more gameplay  but they sure did not escape @melonie mac  s whack-a-mole hammer  no ma am.
sad hearing about sparks of hope. that is actually a good game and they actually improved upon kingdom battle gameplay wise.
instead  they hire people who hate games and think gamers are bad people.
this is why Im glad thq nordic remade the destroy all humans games. I started playing the sequel last night and its pretty cool. for those who dont know the series  you play as an alien sent to earth and basically take over humans and destroy buildings. on foot with cool weapons and with your flying saucer.not to mention the humor is pretty good.
its not just about  woke  audiences  companies just dont want to take a risk by making unique games due to how expensive they are to make these days  so we just get bland garbage targeted at as big of an audience as possible
I remember a time when game devs fought the media and ignored the loud minority  and they made tons of money. now they bend over backwards to these people and ignore the people that actually buy their products. and this trend to make games easier is getting ridiculous. I remember getting stuck on a puzzle for days and there weren t walk throughs online to tell you what to do  so you just kept trying until you figured it out. then you d be super excited and share what you figured out with your friends. good times.
gen x  too. they dont make games for me haven t played a new console game in years
thats why Ive investing heavily into retro gaming. this modern trash sucks. Im loving my ps1 and all those amazing turn based rpgs! great stories  no microtransactions
@wade dewell  they might put out a new legacy of kain. if they make that woke  Im going to have to settle some shit.
@ieatpaste23  no. at this point  nothing should touch it. kain will always be the example of the protagonist living long enough to be the antagonist.
@zoloft77  they put out a survey on if and what kind of kain game they should make. it was done a few months ago.
@ieatpaste23  genocide! I will join you
that was rendered in the in game engine though.
I am pretty sure the metro exodus thing is bullshit there are plenty of game trailers that do have gameplay and I feel this is a weird overreaction birthed from gamers seeing the initial cinematic trailers which by the way ubisoft and such have done since ac1 and are usually in good games followed by a gameplay trailer and immediately freak out and then a gameplay trailer comes out and no one says shit.or they claim its fake.and they dont know shit if it is because games do in fact look and run better when they are in beta development on a high end pc this is why dying light 2s trailers look amazing while the final game was much less than it couldve been but people on pcs have even restored that look so it proves its there.unless a gameplay trailer isnt shown at all I dont really believe in that anymore.
@chandler burse  thats the main issue no matter how good the game is there needs to be at least a demo before the trailer is released.what metro exodus did was put in a level between the cut scenes  the problem with games now is that they stitch all the cut scenes together creating hype around the game and when the initial game is released the gamer becomes the tester.case in point cyberpunk  ac unity on its first release and the list goes on  ubisoft is a redundant example as they fell with unity yet managed to learn from that  as for dying light you just made my point and my point is the gamer shouldn t have to be the one to resolve major bugs for games  one or two small glitches are fine as those dont require major fixes.the point you are missing is games today mess up because the execs want to push the release date spending more time on trailer release than on letting the devs sort out major bugs.
thank you so much  this means a lot
@melonie mac go boom  Im always here to try and support ya    and Im sure plenty of others feel the same way
I sang the song in my head as I was reading that lol
as a Christian right now I am pretty devoid of peace.massive amount of anxiety and issues and struggles with an addiction its nothing but a damn mess. even though ive been better in the past days nothing but mental strain.
I can sort of see why they put these delays on games like skull bones  every time they advertise that game   I read all the comments just torchking it   the company - the main complaint is that you dont get to do ship skurmishes or much else    maybe they re adding ways to do this
would you have said the said thing about the shenmue games
@gloria thomas  Im just having with fun something melonie said.  lighten up.
I seriously dont get where she s coming from. she keeps saying that games are basically walking simulators with a bunch of cutscenes when thats not even true. games are now basically live services with the focus on multiplayer and microtransactions. its seriously hard to find a good linear game now  they are far few and between. also guess what the biggest games that are out right now warzone  fortnite  apex legends  csgo  etc... they re all multiplayer games with no story whatsoever.
@marquez daniel  maybe she s a gamer who has issues with story mode difficulty.  Im not offended and thats the only way I play.  everyone s entitled to their opinions.
@marquez daniel  people do say games are just movies now God of war and last of us. and a few others are cited for being too cinematic although those are really the only two recently I think most point out.ea and activision sure do keep live service alive but single player games are still challenged for being too movie like.rdr2 is another arguably
@chandler burse  I d say God of war  the last of us and star wars jedI fallen order are most definitely heavy on the cinematics but rdr2 is not a cinematic based game at all. its an open world sandbox game and you can literally spend hours upon hours doing absolutely random things without progressing the main story. God of war  the last of us  and jedI fallen order you cant really do that. other than those 3 games there s really no other game that are walking cinematic simulators and that brings me back to my original point I dont get how she s coming up with this narrative that games are just walking simulators when there s literally nothing to back up her claims. you can just look up the active player base on different platforms playstation  xbox  steam  etc and I guarantee you the top games are mostly multiplayer games that are full of gameplay and not story based. like Imentioned it is hard to find big aaa games that are linear and story driven which is what I like to play but instead the market is flooded with battle royales and games that are live services.
@marquez daniel  rdr2 is critiqued for being too restrictive too linear and relying on movie style cutscenes and pathways.
@marquez daniel  God of war has a decent amount of side quests to be fair
youre such a hero for helping to fix ubI s broken multiplayer games  my dude. having played ghost recon wildlands through game pass  Im appalled at how ubI has left the co-op component  which was and still is considered a major selling point of that game  in such a broken  buggy state to the point where I d be lucky if me and my friend could team up for anything longer than a couple of minutes to go hunt santa blanca cartel members together before the game would crash and we d get inevitably booted back to the title screen.
would like to personally thank you  for honor is my favorite game  but multiplayer was seriously fucked on release.  much better now  so again thank you.
@chris greening  thank you. for honor certainly had a lot of potential to be a great aaa title. top shelf graphics  great concept  fast rendering  fun mechanics  transparent mta s  aimed squarely at the gitgud market. it was like crossing cod multiplayer with dark souls. we just didn t get the call in time for me and my knuckledraggers to fix the mp matching timeouts and lag  and I think that little window was enough to kill it.but hey  at least I ll never have to live with the shame of the immortal my face just hurts memes!
at least youre still alive and not blood clotting all over the place! good on you
then why even start a bad run
these non gamers cant cope   people love playing villains in video games   not just hero s . like with star wars the old republic I always turn to the dark side .
fully agree! one thing I will say though mario rabbids is actually amazing I hate turn based combat games but the first mario rabbids was amazing and I will get to the new one but full disclaimer I still haven t beat the first as I got side tracked in picking up no man s sky on switch lol
ok I know Im supposed to be taking a break from social media. but you did honestly think I would miss one of your video.  some of the games these days feel like telltale games. yes genocide simulator does sound better. you dont always want to play the hero.oh I just noticed your mic looks different. did you get a new mic  I love your passion.thank for always bringing us great content. and keeping us informed on the nerd gaming culture. great video. take care melonie.
its a shame sparks of hope didn t sell better  its a good game and great entry point into xcom style strategy games
its always because of the bosses of aaa studios  they dont know squat about making playing games  but if they catch something trendy  they go down to the devs and say we need that or this that. for instance I remember when fear 3 come out that game was weird the I heard it was developed by some guys making mobile games and it was supposed to be more like cod because some suit wanted it.
I wish I appreciated twisted metal when I was young. great story great grafics and cool characters. awesome endings as well. miss games like that
man hit the nail on the head  and yes we are all playing emulation so we can have those great game experiences.
make games great again!!
one thing about this video I want to mention. mario rabbids is an xcom style rpg that gets really hard half way through it.its a game made for real gamers straight up.
new to the channel and liking your take on things in general thus far. I have been gaming for a very long time. skull and bones actually looks very promising from what I have personally seen. would be sad if it didn t move forward  even though its been in development for a long time. I tend to be a big adventure game person. stuff like last of us  a plague tale  horizon  etc. also like the platformers too. I have been going back and playing a lot of retro games  like the zelda series too.
you are sooo right!!!!!! me and my brother have been real gamers since we were kids  we often find ourselves replaying old games! the used to be good companies like ubisoft  and bioware are all justvtrash now. even mortal kombat went to identity politics by taking away the sexuality of the women which I dont understand  its suppossed to be a fantasy game with hyperactive violence and appeal.  this is not the golden era of gaming that once existed.
I really liked immortals fenyx rising. wish ubisoft would do more games with that ip. mario sparks of hope is a great strategy game idk what you talking about there tho. strategy games are niche and they had unrealistic expectations
there s a reason fromsoft titles keep winning game of the year.
I pray that things get better for us gamers. new games have been more disappointing for me than amazing for awhile. I didn t by a single new game last year and I only bought one in 2021 cause its all that interested me that being resident evil village.
they should take a pill for that disfunction  then they d be called ubihard
Im so glad someone with a platform to the masses understands what is actually happening to our chosen entertainment media.
first  I like to say I love all of the video topics you do  melanie! keep up the work!as for my minI rant  Im also getting tired of ubisoft. they used to be my fav dev. I played bg e originally on ps2 on release  so Im part of that handful who is looking forward to the sequel. ubI be like   let s cancel delay games x  y  and z but continue to churn out new assassin s creed games in every time period in existence...  Im personally also getting tired of those non-gamers not letting fantasy be fantasy. especially when it comes to female armor attire  arguments break out between parties saying that needs to be  realistic .  let s have everything in a game be fictional af with the races  sorcery  gameplay mechanics  etc... but we cant have thicc women  or any of them running around with a midriff and short shorts wielding weapons.  r.i.p old school lara croft appearance.
one of my favorite things to do in skyrim is at the end of a long gaming session  save my game and then go on a rampage for fun and then reload the game as if it never happened.
as a fan of the full on revenge mode kratos  it pains me what they did with several things in the newest game  and Im glad I didn t spend money on it. I didn t even bother with the tomb raider reboot  I have underworld   trilogy on my ps3.
sounds like ubisoft is going broke which means they re going to try to out woke the competition very soon.
case in point  mortal kombat. everybody likes to play as the evil characters.
yes I got a new mic! happy someone noticed haha!  d thank you  3
my bad on that one
Ive been contemplating on getting the game. thats good to know!
haha  came down in the comments to see if anyone else pointed this out.  Ive never played either of the mario   rabbids games  but as a guy who has way to much time in the past two xcom games  I got triggered when melonie called it a non-game.  lol
what kind of games do you like  there is a lot of amazing indie games that have come out lately  -
you made a great choice with resident evil village that game is awesome! did you get the gold edition  its totally worth it if you didn t get it
@nicholas fryer  I got the deluxe edition and yeah its a great game!
@peter h  true thats one reason I want a good pc but its just not in my budget atm
watch dogs legion still unfortunate exists but it isnt in a fictional world and all women of shapes and sizes exist in it and are even playable.I still hate that game personally
the first reboot tomb raider was actually quite fun  ones yourealise your playing an uncharted clone... hehe.I think the only remotely tomb puzzle was a single room  and was dlc.anyhoo  I quite enjoyed it.... it just has nothing to do with lara croft or tomb raiding.the second one I forgot  which is like most games these days  forgettable mainstream trash I guess. I got the third for free on epic  but haven t bothered with it yet.
@commdante  I was never interested because I thought it was an unnecessary reboot  similar to that one specific dmc game that barely anybody liked.
gone are the days when somebody would publish carmageddon. I bought a new video card for that game.
well this sucks. was starting to really like them. what s crazy is when stadia announced google was giving it the grim reaper treatment  ubisoft helped me a lot. the people there made sure all saves were transferred and gave me codes to get the games I d already purchased on there. maybe their social media help team should be put in charge.
Im not even a big gamer but games have taken a huge dip in quality and are easily beaten. so yeah great take miss mac
Im glad to hear someone say God of war isn t that much fun anymore. I could not finish the second one. and I couldn t figure out why I didn t like the first one because itseems amazing. its because the game play s not that much fun lol ready for re4 remake man
Im actually surprised ubisoft hasn t gone back and edited their south park games.
the last game I consider that is a classic for ubisoft is ghost recon wildlands and when I realized that they are pivoting to you have to always be online it clicked in my head that they want their games to be artificially obsolete so they can re sell it to you the next gen
great video today melonie! glad you spoke about this topic and you look great today.
skull and bones is such a cool concept for a game. you just take the awesome naval combat of assassin s creed  flesh it out  and make an entire game out of it. and there is no doubt in my mind that ubisoft is going to manage to screw it up in every possible way.
5 20 I relay want a new star wars game to play as the empire  feel the power!ubisoft sounds like bad management  skull   bones was just going to be a spin off from black flag. a game to come out a year or so later to cash in on the craze  to let itsit in development from 2013 till now was insane.
melonie mac  cutscenes are a rewardxenosaga fans
just dance is the only game series that ubisoft annually puts out on a yearly basis but I think they said that they re gonna treat just dance 2023 differently by adding more to it overtime with the just dance unlimited subscription service meaning that even their yearly game series wont be yearly anymore. its a shame since ubisoft has great ips that they ve essentially buried like rayman  rabbids  to some extent since the only way for them to get used now is for a mario crossover   beyond good and evil  and assassins creed which are series that made the company known cuz rayman put them on the map for crying out loud.
Im a new subscriber to your channel and enjoying your videos especially the hogwarts legacy boycott I pay them no attention. Im not surprised with the 6th delay of skull   bones pre-orders may be so low and there s no adventures on land I lost interest like some other people. come on ubisoft
oh I get tired of all these cut scenes. and slow walk scenes. hey melonie. you look amazing. hope youre well.
meanwhile  ubisoft are yet to release that  prince of persia  sands of time.  let s hope it wont get affected as well with all the social media teasing as of late.
this is why you should love what ms. go boom is doing. point blank zero filter opinions. I completely agree. I dont think beyond good and evil 2 will ever come out at this point. all we ve ever seen is trailers with what was clearly just small portions of gameplay to say   we promise  this game is still a thing.
I am a non-gamer that is more interested in interactive storytelling  so the opposite of melanie  but thats fine because I dont see a problem with studios catering to both audiences. let the gamers have their games  let the story folks have their stories and everyone s happy  conflict avoided.
dishonored 1 and 2 are games that I couldn t help but to knock off anyone and everyone I came into contact with when playing. if you played these two games then you will understand that the outcome for playing like that changes things.
mar rab isn t casual  tactics games in general are just niche. also these game companies have taught us over years   years of abuse to never buy games at full price when their the most expensive  most broken   least content complete  unless youreally care about a franchise .
yay a new melonie mac
what bothers me is that itseems that companies are constantly pushing their budgets higher  monetizing them harder  putting every more pressure on each release. meanwhile  they also have to cater for a bunch of people that dont really play games very much. thats why elden ring was such a big deal - its a challenging game that you simply pay once and play for dozens or hours. it doesnt really get much better than that for actual gamers.
thank you so much!
my boI spitting some game tho
check out the gameplay footage they released. it was awful. it is less than what was included in ac black flag and rogue.
I just wanted them to make a pirate sim that combined black flag  sid meier s pirate  and port royale.
Ive noticed this years ago video games have gotten easier compared to the old ones which are incredibly difficult and changes games that dont make sense like assassins creed origins past was not thankfully mirage and moving on looks more back to roots
the only game that comes to mind for me that could even be counted as a  genocide simulator  is stellaris. cause in that game you can straight up declare war on another empire  kidnap their people  shove them onto a prison planet  and use them as livestock. I love stellaris though its an amazing strategy game and should definitely not just shrugged off.
honestly  these days I welcome the delays. as much as I would love another splinter cell  I want them to make it right or not at all.
thank the game developers that gave us the mod community.
poor mario   rabbids
I ll be honest Im all for a good story game and it not being to challenging because Im playing for the story not the challenge but I do enjoy games that are meant to be challenging and less focused on the story.
I hope Im wrong because I am a long time fan of splintercell.  that announcement of remaking it for a modern audience has me very concerned.
I was really looking forward to beyond good   evil too.
supposedly ubI has a deal with the singapore government. they got money and a tax break for creating the studio and making jobs for the country. part of the deal is a game needs to be released. so if they cancel skull and bones  they have to pay the money back. so they ll eventually put something out to avoid losing even more money  but I dont think the game will make back all the money they been putting into it.
if this keeps happening unregulated games might pop out of the wood work.
genocide simulator   I thought that was the farm spot in elden ring.
the worse is that companies gives free copies to these people and then you hear them give games bad review because it doesnt pander to this or that... and im here like.. I dont care if the main char is not brown like me... I just want to play a darn game with a good story and plot. is that too much to ask these days
I haven t played the new God of war games yet  however  I think people can grow and evolve... so I can easily believe that a destructive force like kratos can change and become a humble dad for his son s sake.
they dont want gamers  they want an  audience they are narcissists creating interactive movies
the problem at its core is budgets. to get on the top selling list on wikipedia  we are talking 20  million units sold. we have seen budgets of aaa games balloon to being several hundred million dollars - and after you account for taxes  store front   cut  promotional discounts  summer   winter sales  bundle deals etc   you probably need to sell 15-20 million to account for a budget of modern aaa games. and considering you are competing with screen time with mmo s like ffxiv  world of warcraft  and such  along with battlefront  call of duty  and on we go with the list of games - you have to stand up to be thatsuccessful.in many ways - this is why smaller studio s can come out with innovations far faster  they can afford to take risks  and in some regards  they have to - without the marketing budgets  they need there game to captivate its audience enough that word of mouth becomes their  low cost  marketing means. and this is how you end up with things like vampire survivors  or minecraft thatseemingly come out of nowhere. it is unlikely that a big aaa studio would take the risk on something like factorio or satisfactory  but they exist.all of this brings us to today  where aaa studio budgets for games have ballooned to a point that failing could ruin the studio  be a big cost to the publisher  and so the choice is made to play things safe  do what is known to be playable by a wide audience  avoid too much risk in trying out styles   formats of play. overall - with the way ue5 is with its lighting engine  and improved tools for creating 3d models Im hopeful that the line between what a big aaa studio can do in terms of image fidelity and such  and what a mid tier studio can afford blurs and we see more innovation that force big studio s to reconsider these giant  we cant afford this to flop  productions. but we will see.
bless you melonie! you won me over!
I did enjoy the new God of war games but damn do I ever miss the kratos of old. play through gow3 again and it feels like the game was made in a different universe. the brutality and viciousness are unrivalled.
very good points on gaming scene today.
my favorite from ubisoft was prince of persia . man that was the game back in the day!
why do I feel like its setting itself up for some kind of acquisition   hey  microsoft  you busy
too
if melonie has a hard time believing that then she clearly doesnt know kratos past or character at all.
they really need to narrow down their market and make and polish great titles. they have some good franchises that could become big with some tlc.
delaying skull in bones because everyone complained that it looked like a mobile game. I hope this means they will add in land combat exploration.
happy wednesday melonie mac!
Ive been playing video games for as long as they ve been invented.  literally now if only I could find friends girlfriend  life would be good.
cutscenes definitely have their place in games  but a smart game knows how to feed you information without making you put down the controller.  cod  world at war and half-life come to mind.
on the accessibility features I usually cannot play video games due to something called tritonopia.I can barely play destiny 2 cause thats the only game thatsupports it. yeah there s glasses for it  but the cheap ones  ones I can afford  block certain color elements that can make objects players elements invisible.I cant afford the real ones.so Im stuck playing games on my phone because I can force the tritonopia color space.other than that I dont disagree with anything else here.btw you should have someone describe what you look like as a  partial  colorblind person  I think you might find it hilarious.from my perspective you look kinda like a bic lighter but dont let that be insulting  I dont have the proper vision to actually judge how you look.
I just hope their star wars open world game  avatar  frontiers of pandora  and beyond good and evil 2 are safe.
preach it melonie!
walking simulator  is what concerns me. it kills the value of overcoming a challenge in any game. when you defeat halo 2 on legendary  you ve actually accomplished something.
you are so right.  Imostly play old games like for example  original tomb raider  star wars jedI outcast 2  original crysis  far cry   ff7.  knights of the old republic etc.  Im having a hard time finding new games that I actually enjoy.  I will only buy modern games when they are on a really good sale because I will most likely not like them enough to play them for more than a couple hours.
these game studios are just becoming so unreliable and need to up their own game if they want the support  which I am beginning to doubt they are no longer interested in making games. they may be more interested in using their skills to support film and movie studiosimo
I feel the problem is deeper than much people think   well they re business for profit  as soon as their profit drops they will get back to sanity . but is not happening  at the contrary we have more and more wokeness infecting the gaming industry...
it looks like the best games we will ever see are behind us.  to make those games again are no longer affordable.
its the fact of many jumped in for the money without understanding what made games games same with a lot of these huge ips. the new generation of players will decide with time if it changes.
most ubI games have become long boring slogs lately  full of people talking to you constantly. not too broken up as long as sam fisher doesnt get destroyed.
I actually did like the first mario   rabbids game so I decided to get the sequel. itstill has half the usual quality of nintendo there so itshouldn t be that easy  and if these journos want an easy game  they should pick up a visual novel. or perhaps play the first level of pac man and only the first level. or even just play tic tac toe by themselves. a true gamer will push themselves even if an obstacle is too tough because you slowly learn how to get better and have fun when you pass the hurdle.
lets hope japanese video game bastion will never fall  subscribed
Im all for having a game with a story  though I would like to still  be a game . I want to advance the story directly due to my prior actions  which should be more then hitting a button labeled  hit x to advance   and sometimes see myself f it up when I do  in fact  f it up. Imay or may not choice to wipe out the race of cuddly orphan rabbits for 2.3 gold pieces  but the morality of the act either way is countered by the very simple fact that its not real! I just never got where the idea that game actions reflect real actions came from  if someone fails to separate a video game from real life  there s something in the person thats mis-wired  not the game thatseveral hundred  other kids are playing without issues.
honestly I loved mario   rabbids sparks of hope but they put a damn level cap that killed the fun.
I wouldn t say that Im  resorting  to playing older games. thatsuggests I would not be playing them if there were new games that are great. I d say all of the doom games are worth playing  but that wont stop me from replaying the original. there are plenty of great newer games  but unless they  properly  remake all of the classic greats  I ll continue to play the old ones. I would say   Im continuing to play old games that are better than most new games.
halo to me always felt like just scI fI cod.and I dont see beating cod as an achievement.
@chandler burse  I can see why you d think that  but its still very reductionistic. and regardless  cod is based on real wars at that.      cod doesnt have a still-existing book fan-base or anywhere nearly as quotable and timeless a script as halo does. there aren t really any action figures worth collecting for cod.     and exactly which titles  aside from their few campaign moments  have had honorable gameplay and community in competitive play for c.o.d. or halo in the last 10 years
@chandler burse  I think the first blackops  mw2 or world at war are my favorite cods.
@beregond  I figured they were the same I couldve sworn the jokes about insulting and mountain dew drinking nerd lobbies were aimed at both.I dont know I dont really care I doubt halo would ever interest me at this point since Imostly abandoned most basic fps at this round whether or not anything I said is true.
I wish there could be a video game producer who could have your opinion on critical theory feminism for games. I want another  tombraider.  have a great rest of week melonie
skull   bones is the name of a secret society   so its good thing that the game keeps getting delayed
gow was going in that direction. look at gow3 where he sees what his hate and vengeance rought. he sacrifices himself to save what s left of greece. ragnarok wasn t the greatest to me but it had a lot of good stuff in it.
investing in an audiance they want but not have
anybody who cant understand the genocide simulator concept has never played a dynasty warriors game  or even know they exist probably . wading into a swarm of enemies and laying waste is one of the most satisfying feelings that reality can never provide to me. games allow us to perform the impossible.
beyond good and evil 2 was never really happening  I am convinced that the trailers we got were only ever thrown out to be a bandage onto ubisofts rep. they hate us!- put out a beyond good and evil 2 trailer news to get them distracted again.  this is from an assassin s creed fan at least the games that are about actual assassins  also dont forgot ubisoft did all that nft nonsense too so that hurt them.
oh bloody hell
I need ubisoft to make a remake or sequel to cold fear
new devs nowadays who doesnt game needs to get checked out in the gaming industry. thats all I saying.
wonder if that price of persia remake has been cancelled
just dance 2023 didn t even have an official physical copy this year from ubisoft! thatshould explain a lot about their extreme budget cuts that are taking place at ubisoft.
sparks of hope  defitnely a great game.
I dont even get excited anymore for any of these games lol. a splinter cell remake ugh nah im good man
as an old school gamer and single full time father  Im making a twitch stream for me and my daughter  7 . we are going to start with hogwarts legacy and throw in some good old megaman and stuff such as that in there.
been playing video games for 35 years  so I went through all kinds of ages. I disagree when people say that video games with a lot of cutscenes aren t video games or that people playing these games aren t gamers. youre missing out on some of the most amazing experiences like God of war  read dead redemption  spider-man  etc. these games have a ton of cutscene  there is definitely a lot of walking  but I ll never forget those stories. neither will I ever forget the first time I beat super mario bros 3. all these games are great in their own way and people playing these games are gamers.
the crew 3 motorfest. guessing that was canceled  if so Im sad.
hope thatstar wars game and the splinter cell remake wont be cancelled.  and being back prince of persia!
fromsoft is coming up and coming up hard  maybe cause of what you spoke about  they are games for gamers  elden ring didn t hold your hand  fromsoft makes no apologies
youre on crack  the 2018 gow was amazing. I haven t played ragnarok yet but hear lots of good things. but as far as 18 kratos goes  he got character progression! they didn t reimagine him  he got older. people change over time. there was a whole subplot about him reclaiming his bloodthirsty ways.
ubisoft quality games arent anything to miss at this point
y all gotta let this tomb raider thing go. its called a reboot for a reason. it ain t suppose to be the same.them -  there s this girl named lara. this is who she is and what she does. you -  boo. thats not the lara I know. them -  thats because its not the lara you know.
@thedarkemissary  the writers are the ones creating the problem. nobody cares what some substandard writer s  artistic vision  is for an established character. if they want to do something new they should introduce new characters. having said that  notice this is exactly what they did for tlou2  and they were punished for creating characters nobody liked or wanted. to me it illustrates what happens when you prioritize  the message  over what your actual paying customers want.
@thedarkemissary  I love the tomb raider reboots but understand why people dont like them and I think melanie said it best...why make a tomb raider game where the tombs are optional...  or something to that effect. also reboots are supposed to be somewhat faithful to source material.
@clerical error  the story didn t help lou2 as well but yeah no once cared to play as  abby and the way joel was killed was bullshit.
@aaron aguilar  there are 86 versions of batman. not all of them are popular. but  none of them are bad simply because they aren t the one you like. same applies to a 3d action adventure game titled tomb raider. I love the originals. I love the reboots. yes. you can do both.
@thedarkemissary  yeah same here I love both versions too. Im just saying I can understand if you grew up on the older stuff and dont like what they did with a reboot. most fans of dmc dont like the ninja theory reboot as well. good or bad is matter of opinion really. I didnt like the batman  for example  for various reasons  speaking of batman. I get what you are saying. the bigger issue and the point of this video is these video game devs publishers are trying to appeal to people who pretend to be gamers and basically want an interactive movie. whats maddening is that there already is a game genre for interactive experiences yet these people still bitch and complain when a popular franchise doesnt bend over backwards to make it  easier  for them to beat.
@thedarkemissary  when the big boobs went away they cant forgive.I guess flat chested or smaller cup sizes is like a sin to people here it feels like
@clerical error  punished  again people say tlou2 did bad but then it also seemed to have done well  I thought it at least sold 10 mill which is pretty good and neil was promoted sony cares about profit foremost so I dont think it tanked as much as people claim but it also didnt do super well as others also claim
@clerical error  abby is liked by a decent amount of the fandom now ive seen quite a bit and yes I know  thats just the minority  they say the same about your side so which should I fucking believe  I just do not care anymore.
@aaron aguilar  joel being killed is bullcrap because he didnt die a hero that he isnt suppose to be  joel cant even get a heros death because tlou1 never meant him to be one but yet people took thatside anyways and refused to see how gray tlou1 is.its why the ending was even good if it was black and white it would have ruined the feeling of tension when joel made his decision without ellies knowledge and lied to her.but people just go on and on and on about how joel was a good person was a good hero.hell at this point nathan drake isnt even much of a damn hero since he provokes conflicts that lead to murdering 100s of men in every game lol.jak and crash are suppose to be heroes joel is just a survivor and he choose what he desired which isnt evil or good.
@chandler burse  thats not really the point I was trying to make but ok. my point was he never would have been killed in the fashion he was going off of the previous game. no one ever said joel is a hero  but that is also subjective you can argue that joel is a hero to ellie. part 2 will never sell as many copies as the original game and thats what matters at the end of the day. also about half of those 10 million copies sold you mentioned were sold at heavily discounted prices. Im willing to bet you if they make a part 3 it will most likely flop or sell even less copies. the brand has been damaged whether yourealize it or not. if you like part 2  abby  and you want to deepthroat druckmann for giving you that experience then cool  good on you. I could honestly care less  however dont sit here and say that it was widely acclaimed and loved because one you would be wrong and lying  2. there is no data that really supports that  so its really a matter of opinion  and 3. the backlash was fucking massive and well documented.
@aaron aguilar  you still have to insult someone for even liking the game still dont you
@aaron aguilar  I never said it was widely acclaimed and loved either
@aaron aguilar  some of the backlash is legit overreaction as I still see people who think abby is trans which she is not some people didnt even play the game and thats obvious many games have had backlash and often arent as terrible as people want to say.I expected the worst of the worse but what I got was just decent at most and not bad at worst.maybe it helps I did like the first game but dont praise it as high as others I dont know. but there are worse games that have ruined brands much more.I still have a tiny bit of resentment thay tlou even exists at all since nd trading jak and daxter for the more serious games really started with tlou.but at the same time people constantly say no one likes this game and that is as much of a lie as saying its loved by everyone.
@aaron aguilar  I dont really know what fashion he wouldve died in your opinion.people say joel was too tough to die that way Imean he is older and honestly joel shouldve died in 1 when he was impaled on a rebar that was arguably as dumb as people think the golf club is. but he only survives that because plot armor and he needs to keep going.games unfortunately suffer from that effect.
@chandler burse  your nathan drake point also makes no damn sense but I cant tell if you were joking or serious when you typed that. first of all nathan drake didn t murder anyone ok  he set out to look for whatever treasure or adventure he was looking for and there was always another group of mercenaries to try and stop him from doing so by trying to kill him  so no nathan drake was defending himself 100  of the time in every game not provoking anyone. just so you know you do have a right to defend yourself if attacked whether provoked or not. I dont know why its all of the sudden a huge problem in this country to defend yourself nowadays  to the point its stigmatized. I ll agree it doesnt really make him a hero but again hero is a very relative term.......
@aaron aguilar  nathan is literally joked about as a murderer among the fandom all the time.he is a mass killer and often he puts himself and his friends in those situations.cmon its mostly a joke based off that
@aaron aguilar  good Lord you seriously took my nathan drake joke that is uncommonly made and turned it into a lesson about the 2nd amendment.jaysus dude.
@chandler burse  lol  like I said I didn t know if you were joking or not my bad....
@aaron aguilar  Imean its fine but its a common joke as far I know based on nate massacring armies and not caring at all.the games never seem to bring up the reasonable ptsd he should have but they are basically the next step for jak and daxter I guess. but even jak ironically sort of had ptsd from the events of inbetween 1 and 2.
@chandler burse  he is to busy counting his money made from escapades to worry about ptsd lol. I see drake as more closer to crash bandicoot to be honest. crash is always running aways from traps in a comical way. drake is always running from mercs trying to kill him and from traps lol.
@aaron aguilar  nate usually if rarely makes money from his adventures at least til the last game he was in.he does canonically keep valuable collectables but 4 confirms he never sold any.
@chandler burse  if I remember correctly I think sulley sneaked off with a small fortune in the first game and gave some to drake but its been years since I played them so I could be mistaken.
@aaron aguilar  I dont know I disliked the first game somewhat never beat it.
@chandler burse  well its dated for sure now. at the time it came out it was cutting edge though.
glad you mentioned spider-man  2018 . its pretty much as a current spidy game from an old ps2 game on spider-man 2 back in 2002. web slinging was the major component of gameplay that the developers at insomniac better get right  esp. traversing around the city .
agreed
she hasn t even played the game  let alone ragnarok. just another grifter desperate for views
@underthegun897  its a playstation game buddy  they play the same.
angrboda is black its woke oh no.youre gonna hear someone say this at some point swear to God
@john bishop  not really  days gone doesnt play the same as God of war I argue.however it does play the same as most other basic survival sandboxes
@john bishop  thanks for telling us you dont play them  buddy
I totally buy kratos s priority shift after maturity and parenthood set in. and honestly its not that different than a lot of great old games in terms of gameplay  such as prince of persia or other closed-world action puzzle games. I think you have some icks about gow that prejudiced you  but its pretty unanimous that its a rock solid game.
when people really dont want to be the  bad guy  all games in the warhammer 40k universe would have no playerbase.
while aaa game companies make  games  for non gamers. it really makes me glad that there are games like the  x  series by egosoft  extremely complicated  simulators that are not even understandable to the layman.
I would argue that dance games are fairly difficult games. at least  I remember dance dance revolution being really difficult.
nothing wrong with rule 34
I highly enjoyed playing manhunt its a stealth kill horror game
back in my day in 199x ubisoft was just a developer synonymous with rayman  the most frivolous but cute game from that period... and now I learned they re from france  the wokest country with the ieast amount of showers. it all makes sense now.
just one giant  yes!  to everything in this video.
gotta do the nft stuff
melonie great to c another video from u have a great day
wtf  mario   rabbids 2 was awesome... its the closest thing ever to a real super mario rpg 2
what games are you calling walking sims  what games are movie games  I have been pretty happy with the new games I have played  Imean there are some I dont like but that is always the case...
Imostly buy ports of old games in steam because its rare that a new game appeals to me. I tried valorant but I saw that they support lghfgtq  and I actively avoid companies thatsupport the alphabet mafia.
skull and bones is the perfect name for ubisoft as a company . I wonder when microsoft will buy them .
when ubisoft stopped taking rayman games seriously I knew they were done for
this is why Ive stop buying games it too easy and not a challenge   and when did game stop u having to thinking about what u are doing  thats  where the fun was for me
Ive been so disappointed in western games for years. I am mostly a jrpg gamer now because of it. and now itseems like cdpr is going western woke with witcher 1 remake and that depresses me more than anything  being a massive witcher fan. Imiss the older game community and games. I agree with you about God of war. I loved the God of war series and thought the 2018 was pretty good  but I cant seem to get through ragnarok. I ended up going back to ffviI remake and crisis core reunion.
wow. when even mario  mario  cant save your butt  you know you have one foot in the grave.
I was looking forward to beyond good and evil.
still wandering about prince of persia..
kratos priority shifted after he saw his homeland plunged into chaos due to his actions.he had no one left to get revenge against why do people think kratos goal is nothing but killing every God  no his goal was to kill zeus but then the fates got in his way so he beat them  hades and posiedontried to stop him so he killed them.he even gave helios a chance to tell him how to defeat zeus and then killed him when he refused. kratos killed Gods he had vendettas against he did not seek out conflicts unless they were slowing him down purposefully.this is why people make those dumb Jesus vs kratos jokes and mean itseriously sometimes. kratos wouldnt even kill Jesus and not because Jesus is like very enlightened or whatever but because as far as Jesus lived he was non violent he wouldnt start conflict with kratos anyways same for other Gods of similar virtues.
paper mario  am I a joke to you!
@hotdice  I like paper mario but its never been anywhere near as good as mario rpg with the exception of 1000 year door
kingdom come  deliverance is probably my favorite game of all time  but Im legitimately worried that thatstudio will go in the same direction.Ive been playing a lot of rpg maker games lately lol
as someone who s never played the original crisis core  ccr is awesome!!
I havent seen anything thatsays witcher 1 remake is woke tho
@chandler burse  they said they are making it for  modern audiences  which 9 times out of 10 means woke. melonie has a video on it.
@missshelbycobra  I dont know is that what they specifically said melonie also said silent hill 2 remake is woke but it did not specifically say that and people there assumed it would remove the mannequin rape scene which the trailer still has and the nurses are still sexy so.we need to see some content first unless geralt is black and the sex cards are gone it cant be too horrible.also the combat has aged poorly so maybe thats for the modern audiences they mean
this has been an issue with almost all modern games outside of a few indie devs and of course fromsoft. it actually drives me nuts because I see no point in playing something thats just an extended movie.
I been gaming sense the nes and I  can call myself a gamer but I can agree   because I cant stand politics in games thats why I quit playing some fighting games
well they likely were making them for  modern audiences  so does it really matter  if you want good games youre likely going to need to go to indie titles.and let s be honest. skull and bones looks terrible. the only reason skull and bones is still coming out is because of the loan they took from a foreign nation to fund it. they re obligated to continue to make it.
Imiss rayman  specifically the 3d games.
cinimatic games are fine if they blend really well with the gameplay. and delays are what we actually want  we want quality  we dont want a rushed product.
is it just me  or do aaa game dev studios have a time management problem
you d think if they keep cancelling all of these games  they d spend some of the money on funding and actual advertising for for honor. yeah  we re still here!
happens to anything that goes mainstream  quality just drops.
if I find out if one of those cancelled games is prince of persia sands of time trilogy remake of the first game I will be entirely dissapointed
I love story driven heavy dialogue games. Ive been a gamer for about 30 and I was always drawn to rpg s and games like metal gear solid. I just wish characters were still allowed to be sexy in video games and that western media would not push their woke agenda on to japanese devs
Ive been gaming since the atarI 2600...I do enjoy games for the play but at the same time I appreciate a good story...ace combat  assassin s creed  not all of them   red dead 2  final fantasy etc...
I wish some other game company would cone along and by the rights to tom clancy and his whole library of games bearing his name
we have a genre for easy mode gaming... visual novels. and for every vn out there you need a dark souls.
every game has its place  even walking simulators. for example  there are some people who are brilliant story tellers but cant rig a 3d model to save their life or animate something. I am speaking of visual novels. yeah  they re  games  but not in the traditional sense. sometimes I want to play yakuza and beat the crap out of a bunch of punks that look at me the wrong way  sometimes I want to play bote simulator  world of warships   other times I want to play a game in which I rob a bank  payday 2   and so on. but the difference between those that make games in each of these  causal  genres and them is that the nu developers dont care for their games  they aren t made with some vision in mind where one game style is superior to another in telling their storyor interacting with the digital world they created  they just want it to be as easy as possible. press forward to win. there s a casual  gatcha game that I play called azur lane. on the surface its waifu bote simulator  but you actually have to look at their skills and equip the best things otherwise you cant complete higher level content and you do have to pay attention to multiple stats  granted you can sort of brute force it  but thats an aside .
been a game for roughly 30 years and I spend far more time on r34 sites than I will ever admit.
I just want a new rayman game
Ive fallen off of the assassin s creed tower  and I didn t land on a pile of hay.I landed in a world too closely connected to the  real  world  and my escape has been hijacked by people who have no imagination.
ubisoft alone have murdered the open world genre elden ring and the God miyazakI saved its life
melonie big fan they need a hitso ubisoft is banking on the avatar open world styled farcry game
it was singapore  right its crazy that they didn t just make their original concept and release it instead of whatever they are doing.
skull and bones only exists because of the success of blackflag.they shouldve just made a sequel to blackflag.its been in development since ac4 came out
your hate for people with physical issues is noted...
almost all games with climbing use color cues.uncharted has always had them same for ghost of tsushima  which is odd since sucker punch made the infamous games which didnt have any cues for what you could climb on because everything was climbable
they should just make a pirate game like ac black flag but without the assassin stuff. thats all that anyone wanted
I dont mind kratos trying to mellow out after all he s done and been through. but the recent 2 games are okay at best. and itsupremely annoys me how some  fans  and even sony themselves downplay the original games to a nauseating degree. especially when the old games actually had a lot of depth and these norse games would be worth nothing if the old games didn t serve as the foundation.
ubisoft lost its special something after the first divison game  never hit the same heights again
like I said there are only few games  aI play anymore. legend of zelda and cyberpunk are my only hopes anymore
my wife is going to be mad thatskull and bones is delayed yet again. she s been so amped up for that game.
I am 60  and I grew up in the video game age from pong to today  and they have gone from games that were fun to games that are all about looks  I loved the first atarI and intellivision or the first nintendo and sega and I still have my playstation 2 and dreamcast but today it is all about money and in that drive they have forgotten how to make just a great game
omg  melonie  I  think this is the first time ever that I disagree with you. the last 2 God of war games were awesome. yes  it had a lot of cutscenes  but they were great  and it also had great gameplay combat to go with it. I dont mind cutscenes as long as they tell a good story while also having great gameplay. cutscenes can make you connect with the characters more  in my opinion. anyway  first time I ever disagreed with you on something  and Ive been following you since you first started youtube back in the day lol
idk...Im a real gamer. Ive been playing since the atarI 2600  owned practically every console  and beat elden ring last year. I enjoy alot of walking simulators. there s room for everything if the market  supports it. also the new harry potter games looks sweet. Ive been looking for a real good genocide simulator game to sink my teeth into. I d imagine ubusoft is actually delaying skull and bones because it looks like dog shit  even after all these previous delays.
this reminds me of the sims franchise now. no gameplay  too much worries about pleasing the public   and money hungry
accessability features are not about making the game easier   just accessable.   I think you are misusing the term there   not sure why fov sliders   colourblind options   subtitle options etc would be a detriment to a game
I hope they dont cancel assassin s creed. that my all time favorite game series. also I hope they dont make more cut scenes and less game play.
they are trying to snuff out the chaos yet still encouraging confusion.
melonie  what you described is not a cinematic experience    walking simulators with pretty cutscenes . tomb raider for the laast 15 years has been a cinematic experience. uncharted 1 - lost legacy are cinematic experiences. pretty much the entire modern sony catalog is exactly that. I do agree that a cinematic experience can be abused in such a way where no substance can be found in a game  but I think youre downplaying them a bit too hard. not everyone wants to live in an open world game for 100 hrs picking through the same bush asset for resources for 60hrs of that play time.as far as ubisoft goes. they ve gone down mtx and live service hell. thats why they are having these issues. they lost their way and just churn out mc donald s cheese burgers for video games and expecting aaa prices or in their own lunacy aaaa prices for games. neither of which they produce. honestly I dont know that anything needs to be done. let them fall a part and sell their ip off to other companies that will use them more responsibly.
I wish ubisoft would go back to making rayman games  I think we re all crying out for more stylized games. that includes beyond good   evil 2  I love the original and still think its one of the coolest adventure games ever made.
I wish ubI would return rainbow six to the old style
I dont play many  if any!  modern games  but what you describe is the same thing that they ve been doing to all fandoms.  dumb down scifI so non scifI fans can get in to it.  make superheroes movies like sitcoms so non comic fans can get in to it.  I could never put my finger on what felt so odd about the 2005 dr who reboot  but it is clear to me now that the whole concept was dumbed down for an audience who were more in to soap operas.  ironic since classic who was essentially a children s show  that it was a lot more focused on its storytelling than the modern version that focuses on feelings  lust  romance  betrayal  etc.
its likely predatory monetization that people are hopefully starting to get wiser to and rejecting. when was the last time a game came out from these triple a companies that felt like it was actually finished  most games come out half assed and unfinished and get the additions trickled in as dlc. only then do we finally get the  complete editions . its just not worth buying games at launch  and these companies are showing their true colors with these  100  complete editions . its going to make people more selective in what they buy.have you played xcom by chance  isn t mario   rabbids supposed to be an xcom clone  more or less
maybe ubisoft forgot how to code lol
oh come on melanie  the 2018 God of war is not woke   the combat is awesome and cut scenes are great  Im mean the combat  you can get screwed up pretty fast   I have a feeling you never played it..  people can change.. and Gods. I dont like this satanic woke movement  but God of war isn t part of it
I think the nicest way to describe kratos in g.o.w is irredeemably evil
omg  I would love this.
@blockmasterscott  thats what they were originally gonna do. I have no idea how they fucked that up so bad.
this is what skull and bones sort of is you know that right  its been development since ac4 came out its been in development hell they wanted to make it because of the success.another ac with pirates would honestly be a better thing
did she see the gameplay footage they released  you d be better off playing ac  black flag or rogue. extremely arcade-y and you dont cant even go ashore except for cut scenes. sid meyers  pirates is better than what they showed  at least it doesnt take itself seriously.
@little sausage  her favorite game of all time is black flag. thats why she was so amped to play skull and bones.
yep  gaming was so much better when it was done by passionate gamer devs back then rather than business bean counters right now. sad thing is some of those bean counters I remember as passionate gamer devs before  back in the day. I wish gaming didn t get so popular at times. we had a lot more value with games before  and now a days we mostly get milked for all we re worth. money is king that overshadows passion when it comes to game design these days  particularly for the bigger companies. can still find some passionate indies  though. thank goodness!
yeah  its a God of war of a different flavor but the combat can be challenging nonetheless  esp. on the highest level . I am still playing the second one  and combat gameplay is what one would expect from a God of war game where to dispatch your foes with the greatest of efficiency will require you to become knowledgeable of your enemies  their strengths and weakness and your collection of skills and moves against them.
honestly 2018 was great.  ragnorok was garbage in all fronts.
@jude ceant  cool  thats your opinion. I disagree
yes tomb raider has been a cinematic experience since 2006  if not 2003. and thats why it isn t tomb raider any more. ruined what was once a legendary gaming experience in its classic days.
@melonie mac go boom  while I can appreciate your love of the pre-legend days of tomb raider  you might want to consider that you have some rose colored glasses on from nostalgia. Im not being facious here  I have the same problem with soul reaver. the age of the block puzzle was pretty rough back then  tr was no stranger too it. I rather enjoy the two reboot trilogies much more than my time with tr. I think its wrong they took your franchise a way from you  I know I d feel the same way if they made uncharted open world  I have my complaints about the new God of war games as much as I enjoy them and praise them as goty material. if they failed I wouldn t be blaming their cinematic nature. honestly would love to talk more about this.I think these two things are also pretty divorced from each other. as I said  ubisoft is failing because of where their company is focused. too busy chasing after mantra s and get rich quick schemes  rather than really making games. thanks for responding. I appreciate it  -
honestly marvel always had an issue with making comics too lighthearted but then they switch it up when dc would also switch it up.unless it was more recent punisher arcs I guess
honestly he s actions would still make him a greek hero in the long run.
I loved ubisofts prince persia games the best trilogy but they have changed so much the woke changed them its sad how deep they fell
ive been buying nothing but indie games for the past 10 years... so I think its fine for the big gaming companies to go bankrupt.
lmao ubI is just throwing in the towel and this point.
I just want to know what was the game that turned melonie into a gamer..
genocide simulator sounds like command and conquer mixed with sim city.
I agree 100 percent!!!!!!!!
genocide simulators are pretty much all I have been playing the past 2 years  ubisoft will be well aware of my kill counts in the last 3 ac games but I enjoy hooking up with anything I can as well  you can do both. ubisoft have always said in ac games since day one  that they are a multicultural team and they have been respectful of the time periods and peoples they use but at the same time we can just wreck everything. the main culprit of these cut scenes games is sony  especially last of us etc its a difficult time people dont have the money to spend on just dance in january 2023. ubisoft are just adjusting to the market as many big companies are having to do. as is said a lot on nerdrotic etc it is money in the end which will make the decisions not angry people on the internet.
what about the sands of time remake
long as we can keep getting stuff like eldon ring from good studios ubI can keep shooting them selves in the foot till they blow it off.
the problem is that the reaction to horrible things going on at ubisoft and blizzard studios is to change the content of their games - not just fire the problematic people. why are gamers being punished for the actions of some of the staff
what happened to being qualified for the job
I am far from woke... but I love the new tomb raiders.. I like the more human  realistic lara. I beat elden ring twice.. so I liked it aswell. God of war rag. was just way more effort.. had a actual story that was good. combat was fun. and kratos is just a bad ass who is fun to play as. maybe because I am a father I find him very relatable.  and I was terrified that the game was going to be a woke disaster and the wokeness was pretty low. I respect that too. Imean there is some wokeness  but it wasn t horrific.  and what are these triple a walking simulators you talking about
what happened to the new mario and rabbids game  didn t that do well or no
unrelated  melonie has fantastic hair.
@meloniemacgoboom 3 40 yeah this is one take of ur melonie  I have to say is half wrong because mario   rabbids  spark of hope is a rpg game and a fun one if Imust say for my self as a rpg gamer. the game only have story cut scence when you are doing the main mission and they last about 3 to 5 min long  meanwhile you are doing puzzle challenges  side mission  and fighting enemies in a rpg kind of style most of the time. I do have to say the puzzles aren t really difficult and the battles are a bit easier than the last game because of the new power system that they added to give you larger options in how to win the battles than the last game.  which you dont use and can beat the game without it   to my opinion calling mario   rabbids  spark of hope a non gamer or not a core gamer game is a bit moronic coming from u when u only read the title and not looked it up or actually play the game to say much about it other than it  being read next to the dance dance game and honeslty its especially moronic really from u since u used to work for gamestop and must have run into games like these that are from nintendo side of the gaming industry. for example by ur standard if much  many and many nintendo games   and even rpg games  are would fit into the non gamers  not core gamers games group like pokemon  kirby  mario  donkey kong   zelda  yoshI  the luigI s mansion series  xenoblade  chronicles  animal crossing  megaman  kid icarus... etc. the mario   rabbids  spark of hope was targetted to nintendo gamers who like the rpg genre that currently is being competing with many and many indie  double a rpg games.
hey melonie Ive have a question for u would u go ontothe reality show special ops I know you had done something like it a year ago or so with gamers.your awesome takecare melonie
they re probably worried about it being heavily pirated.I ll see myself out.
so many of the game studios that used to make great games in the past aren t really making hit great games like they used to. another example is konomi.
my poor gamer s heart can never be satisfied. I ll just console myself with nintendo bootlegs.
for the og rpg fans  ubisoft published evolution  one of the best sega dreamcast rpgs
tomb raider 1 is what first awakened my obsession really  but I was playing video games before that in general. I cant remember the first game I ever played  my brothers and I just always have been gamers ever since we could hold a controller haha
@melonie mac go boom  excellent. have a opinion on the tomb raider remake    not the reboot!
@melonie mac go boom  I was just a young kid of 6 or 7 when the first gaming industry crash  the atarI one  occurred. thank God I didn t know how bad e.t. was. its good to now know I grew up as nintendo began its meteoric rise. many great memories from rbI baseball to legend of zelda. as soon as I got my own pc with my own modifications and upgrades  I got really into space simulators from the x-wing series from lucasarts to freespace series and even the independence war series. I am still very disappointed that its 2023 and no one has tackled a video game based on either babylon 5 or the expanse  even battlestar galactica.
wait wait wait  sparks of hope a non game ! what lol.
I hope they will continue to cancel more games and keep delaying release dates too.
never played the classic God of war games but Ive watched the cutscenes and playthroughs and compared them to the new games and I can confidently say I would take the old games over the new ones.
as an old gamer  having grown up with beachhead   leisure suit larry  you think pixel porn is disgusting  but battlefield slaughter is not the customers can change that with their wallets and by explaining to studios at every opportunity why they dont buy their games targeted at the  modern audience .
id like to see the division 3...
melonie is the best and she spells cancelled with 2 l s..which is how we do it in australia.
I smashed up my wrists badly two and a half years ago so I dont have the ability to use my hands as I used to for console gaming.  I had moderate carpal tunnel syndrome for eight years before that  so Ive not really been good at actual games for a decade or more.  thatsaid  I understand the appeal of interactive stories  but they re not gaming.  so I play more strategy or turn based games now  though Imiss the ridiculous fun of the old doom quake shooters and other games like sid meier s pirates that I used to play that required more manipulative ability than I have now.  even simpler things like mario kart are almost beyond my capability to play  so my switch has sat switched off for a long time now.  alas.interactive story programs are potentially fun  but they shouldn t be labeled as  games  because there s not much of the gaming aspect to them.  as much as I like the cutscene stories from mass effect  andromeda  that I watched on youtube because as much as I enjoyed the original mass effect  even if I never beat it  I wasn t willing to buy a game that I couldn t actually play   the game itself was filled with awful gameplay that gradually got improved with patches.  and thats bs.  if actual gaming companies got actual game players who have actual creative skills for making actual games  then the market would be actually great and I d actually hate not being able to play actual games a heck of a lot more than I do now.  but there s basically a wasteland in the universe of console games right now because game companies are so focused on non-game things instead of games.  so we get interactive novels presented as  games  with lame and or buggy so-called gameplay thats just there to interrupt the cutscenes.  hogwash.maybe I ll win a lottery someday and be able to get my wrists fixed before Im too old for console games  yeah  I turn 55 this year  but let me dream dang it   but seeing the scene today all I ll have to do is pull out the original x-box and boot up pirates  cos it ll be much better than the new  games  available.
youre 36 melonie  you still look gorgeous. now I have some hope that my 40s wont be too bad
gaming will die if we dont stand our ground same with movies and tv .
they need this many people that aren t white   exactly melonie! the industry has become antiwhite
ubisoft already lost me when they decided to shut down servers and access to dlcs back in september. not gonna give them any money...
the problem with ubi-soft is that they have being doing the same game  since far cry 3. now every game must be an open world camp liberator with watchtowers rp game
I haven t played an ubisoft game since king kong back in 2005. fun game.
I agree
I really love the new God of war  the previous God of war makes a great background for a man trying to raise his son to be better than he is. I cant speak on the gameplay  though. still looks fun to me.
ubisoft is imploding harder than activision.
a lot of the white and asian guys that are the actual game lovers and creators of good mechanics and ideas have gone to either indie games or board games
I can understand what you were talking about with just dance  but mario   rabbits not being a real game  its a mario game  that plays like xcom isn t it  I dont really think tactics stops being a game genre just because you be soft made it and put rabbits in it.
I need a new tomb raider now   Imay be crazy I want a strange brigade sequel   must have a new zombie army!
as someone in the industry  there are plenty of talented people making games with a ton of promise. but they are always passed on in favor of things almost nobody wants. most of the devs are gamers  but they dont have the power to make important choices in what they re making.it makes me sad  that actual gamers are being ignored  seemingly in favor of the people who used to bully them for liking games.
I have played them and they are good but I dont think the new ones are worse than them. they compliment each other decently enough and are quite good at progressing the character of kratos.
yes  because p rn actually causes brain damage and turns men into degenerates and incentivises women to be promiscuous  which is also damaging. blowing stuff up in games doesnt have these negative effects
thats fair
true  this happened with tomb raider. the higher ups would deny any attempt at respecting the source
@melonie mac go boom  they should really leave the creative decisions up to the creatives and stick to what they re good at  marketing and money lolI always looked up to characters like lara. she already was a great character for girls to look up to  I dont know why they had to change her at all
woke people arent the ones who bullied people for liking games lol.
@spaghettImobster  people freak out when creators do make their own decisions the last of us 2 was neils concept and he wasnt an exec he was a director who had been with nd since programming for jak 3.still he is problematic to himself I believe
beyond good and evil 2 is never coming out which is a shame the trailers looked cool
when the xbox 360 ps3 generation started gaining mainstream interest  I knew gaming was about to be ruined. along with the big money interests comes their demands  and the big money is ruled by two things. one  making money and hitting as broad a target audience as possible  this was when the  casual gamers  emerged. two  pushing the various political and cultural narratives of the time. games went from being fun and challenging  to being inclusive statements.
ubisoft is the taco bell of video games though. all their games are the same handful of ingredients put together in different combinations.
I was thinking about skull and bones minutes before this video pops up. did youread my mind
I play a game where yourecycle  not only your enemies and body parts to eat  but yourecycle your own crew mates. another game you can decide to purge your pop  to raise happiness with your culture. Im going to buy hogwarts  legacy just to support it. never cared for harry potter  but just to thumb my nose at the nay sayers  why note.
couldn t have said it better
why did you throw accessibility options in as a bad thing  3 22 ... not every gamer who wants to play will meet your definition of perfect health  and accessibility is always something that is good to have.
melonie  lets start a development company with kara lynne and make real ganes
hey hey hey  I agree with everything ya said. but lets leave the the game corn alone yeah. its not their fault xd
I think kratos is still a God mudering crazy man but trying to raise a son to not be him  or am I wrong
thats why I still ps3 and back. I have a theory that all the best games have already been made. same with music and movies.
oh wow  ubisoft still exists. hope they release the new skyrim game soon  or something.
1 31 I kinda disagree. I think for the past decade theyve been focusing on multiplayer  games as a service . literally ppl ate up guardians of the galaxy because even tho the gameplay was basic  the mechanics subpar  and the overall product is below its ps3 predecessors its not  marvels avengers  so it got great reviews.
one name  linkle. she may wind up being zelda cannon.
I thought it was the only one that didn t like constant cutscenes and video games anymore. thats kind of why I got rid of my ps5 because most of sony s games nowadays are mainly just movies disguised as video games. youreally cant find games nowadays that are just gameplay based unless you just want to play an arcade type game. even the new need for speed that I just bought has constant cutscenes and constant talking its like shut up and just let me play the game already lol
I agree w you--the new God of war is  ok. but the originals were way more fun.
Im gonna disagree about God of war  I thought it was pretty interesting to see him try not to be a bloodthirsty monster. but  I still love the older titles.
cant wait for splinter cell reeeemake
that  non-gamer  you mentioned is basically dsp in a nutshell...
ubisoft as a company makes games solely to make money. all their games are  manufactured  in a sense to draw in as many people as possible. those things apply to all games generally. but ubisoft does it aggregiously to a point where its just a turn off.
looool
genocide simulator  serious sam vibes
not a fan of ubisoft  but Im holding out hope for the open world star wars game only because they re building it off the snowdrop engine and using the division series as the template.  considering many of the issues I  and others  had with thatseries was based off it being set in a  real world  environment  Im hoping the sci-fI nature of star wars will fix much of the cognitive dissonance  1 000 bullets to kill a human enemy for example  issues of the division series.
and the chain of games being ruined by non-gamers continues.....I have been a gamer for 30 years now and todays gaming is shocking! identity politics has taken over good and immersive stories in games  amazing gameplay and phenomenal character writing.....I am generally back playing jrpgs like ffviI  viiI and ix and older series now. assassins creed 1 and 2....the .hack series  shadow hearts  the tales games and the original 2 fallout games. back when games were good and not full of sjw nonsense
skull n bones delayed 6x  cancelled!
genocide simulator   I get to be a bad guy in a game  wreck havoc in a fantasy world   I like it!! wonder if your character gets a cool backstory on how they chose the  road to evil  type journey.
its gotta be all those high-budget games right
one of the funniest and fun old game was postal 2  most people forgot about this classic
ubisoft peaked right around when splinter cell 2 and rainbow six 3 game out. after that they slowly died  even though splinter cell 3 was probably their best game ever made.as soon as assassins creed came  they killed splinter cell and started to use the ac formula on literally every single game they put out.
yeah I bet those lizzo sized body positivity   gamers   loved just dance 2023   ubI - soft is getting what it deserves and asking for seconds by cancelling those projects that might ve given it a lifeline
disagree about God of war comment. ive played all three originals and the first entry of the reimagining  and the gameplay first and foremost was fantastic. the graphics and cutscenes are just icing. kratos is much older now and has someone that depends on him. character development happens  and characters can change with time. I am not a fan boy  I enjoyed the games for what they are  fun action packed games.
dungeon keeper and overLord is my favorite because you got to be the bad guy also I play the skull and bones beta and didn t like like it at all also it going for 70 dollars all you do is sail and upgrade your ship. also games for non gamers are the same people going to stream it  on twitch you know the the type of non gamers who s going to stream it a person with less cleavage and brain cells
never trust a company with an esg score
as a consumer you have two choices  buy  not buyorbecome a producer and... make your own.
yes  ubisoft has been off for years going back to 2009 area.
kratos changing  his attitude as he gets older and showing maturity and to be better.. I dont see that as woke and wanting his son not to walk the dark path that his father  thats not woke
walking simulator... death stranding heavy breathing
I am a 31 year old that has gamed all his live  and although I agree that the  modernizing  of games ruins a lot of games I did like both the rebooted tomb raider and the new gow games. and I get what you mean but if you take away graphics and story from any games you dont have anything left.
Im still waiting for rayman 4
maybe we could make fishing something cool so they hijack that and go away and hijack that  I think it wouldn t bother fishers that much  because there isn t that much to destroy. they will fail anyway  so they wont even harm a single fish  for sure
same as  the game mw2.. the call signs  there are 29 call signs  and 22 of them are pride flags.. but not one country flag..
I can assure you  no no one forgot about valves old games they are still talked about especially half life and portal
@chandler burse  indeed I remember being in awe when I got half life back in the day!
a lot of games are excellent at telling a good story. the story is a big reason to play those games and they are no less  games  because of it. people who enjoy them are no less gamers because of it. story content is not the problem. the woke stuff is the problem. I understand what youre saying  but I think you might need to reframe or rephrase your argument about what makes a  real  gamer. the way you ve been saying it  even with the occasional caveat  largely comes off sounding like the same kind of exclusionary superiority the woke people suffer from  even if thats not how you mean for it to sound. just something to think about.
I wouldn t call mario rabbids a non-game  its a tactical strategy-game
which is better combat gameplay wise.. God of war  or God of war 2018
I disagree with mario   rabbids being a  non game   if anything  it requires a bit more thinking than the average gamer wants to use while playing
game play is king.
hey now  Ivery much prefer the pacifist style in gaming!......Imean yeah  every now and then if an npc says something rude to me  I ll swipe my sword at  em just to check but still!
they re also remaking their remake of prince of persia  the sands of time. weird they haven t mentioned it in a while.
they can cancel skull and bones as well. might as well cancel their business too.
that mario game is mario x-com. not sure I would put it in the same non-gamer category as just dance 2023. itseems like more of the  gamer  games are happening in the indie space.
Ive all but given up on s b since the first delay.
knew a guy once that I could guarantee you  the bigger  longer and more unnecessary the cutscenes  the more likely he d spew forth the games praises. never understood it myself. still dont. and this was back in the late  90s early  00s.
glad you brought up the obsession with accessibility options. its so cringe.
they need to cancel splinter cell before they phuk it up.
Im done buying games or mtxs until the woke era of gaming is over. as long as money keeps coming into the industry  even if its for woke-lite games  the status quo will continue. eventually  in the face of losing money  someone will do market research beyond just checking twitter and discover they are catering to activists rather than customers. until then  we need to let their stock lose value and their games underperform  waiting to reward whoever wakes up first. like most gamers  I already own a ton of games I never had time to finish  so Im out nothing by waiting.
must be why retro gaming is so expensive to buy in today and you can find tons of  2-5 dvds and 6  month old games at the bins of wal-mart and dollar stores. the common people are speaking with their wallets
ive hope they wont cancel the prince of persia renake
I understand your argument about games being closer to movies with long pretty cutscenes but I would say that is more relevant to sony   the exclusives they ve been releasing as they re heavily story based. with ubisoft the examples of just dance   the mario   rabbids you used  just dance only appeals to a particular audience which is casual   mario   rabbids I think most people on nintendo are casuals anyways. their main games with assassin s creed  far cry  the division    watch dogs are all pretty similar to each other   thats part of the problem  that   then each sequel is also much of a copy   paste job with changes to scenery. then when they make a new ip or something different it doesnt appeal to many people in general  also none of their games are more focused on gameplay than story at least to me  like assassin s creed valhalla was so over saturated with content I couldn t really tell you what the story was about.
vr hasnt become this thirty dollar headsets yet... I have an online girlfriend came to the u s. long ago and went straight to major cities and turned into pat mcafee is your friend  which is ok
it makes sense that in a world of participation awards that games would become softcore  diversity p0rn  which face the adversity of a pov for a baby s rattle and the difficulty to match. because who knew trying to target people who dont game by making games to low ball dumb people by making them feel smart by completing dumb tasks would be a failing business model.
ubisoft let s make make a pirate game without the ability to leave the ship and do any actual pirate related activities. also ubisoft why is everyone canceling their preorders
yeah I got it mixed up with the party game
thats because those games didnt sell well early on games that did are still higher priced thats why gta 5 and rdr2 are still somehow in the 30 to 40 dollar range and usually not in bins
retro games did terribly or were ignored arent worth much today either unless they are just priced for the vintage
I just wish they d make games fun again  instead of making rushed woke garbage.
is there anything good thats going on in gaming like seriously I haven t heard anything good coming up in the near future of games
remember when gaming was about fun and no one cared about politics  good times.
how did I not see your channel till now
its called hentaI and it is art everything else I agree with especially  genocide simulator  makes a game sound better.
talk thatshit mel
when will they realise that they cant monetise tweets  they should start catering to people who actually buy the games
ubisoft needs a correction. they seem to have little concept of why one entry is well received and why another isn t. they go from a positively received  strong selling title then flip 180 in the next entry by swapping out all the features players actually liked. ac flips from good to bad every other entry. farcry titles have become basically carbon copies of one another set in different locales while the story largely remains the same. with the recession  canceling titles isn t a bad move. if those titles would sell poorly or couldn t find an audience. putting their efforts into their core ips  ac  farcry  splinter cell  r6  is a protective strategy to weather the economic storm. these ips will sell  they have strong customer bases. pretty resources into new ips or low selling filler titles would bleed them dry during the recession.
keep making game for the minority of target audienceon path of going bankruptsurprise pikachu face
kratos went on a killing spree for revenge for his family. this time he goes on a killing spree to fulfill his wifes final wish and protect his son.they didn t change his character at all.
two reasons ubisoft is losing money hand over fist 1  get woke go broke.2  come up with new property  then proceed to milk the property with 20 sequels for 20 years that dont change much about the gameplay at all.
ive been playing video games since 2004 I was 4 even though im 22 I also dont like how games are becoming now
I respect your opinion  however  I completely disagree with you on the new God of war games. the whole point was to show kratos s journey and how he has changed from the murderous  rampaging  God to one who is trying to be and do better. by doing so he has learned to control his wrath and not let it affect his decision making. its cool if you dont like that direction that it went in but to say its not a real game is completely left field. if you are talking about it not presenting a challenge you can always play it on a harder difficulty as well.
thid is what happens when people havw no lives. back when I grew up you didnt read or hear from companies ever. when you saw a game you just bought it or didnt. now all people do is sit an read every little thing and shyt on companies when they have been doing this type of stuff for hundreds of years. we just never knew it.
man I agree with you so much mel the new God of war games are weak as hell in comparison to the original trilogy. Im sorry but kratos was a fucking badass in the original trilogy he literally ripped the heads off of Gods but in ragnarok they wont even let this man kill dat bitch freya who s constantly trying to kill him. like seriously when did kratos get so bitch. man Im so glad you see it too mel like damn  cant stand the new God of war games at all really tried with ragnarok but gave up its just not nearly as good as the original trilogy.
gaming is in such a bad state. so many franchises are being dismantled   having the fun sucked out of them. us gamers played games as escapism from the politics of the world   now the scene has been saturated  I fear we will never see far out   twisted games like dante s inferno or the devil may cry reboot again or for a long time.
wtf happened to beyond good and evil  I haven t heard anything about it for a long  long  lonnnnnng time.
games are a joke now. if I was to win the lottery  we all say that every now and then  I would buy a lot of old school stand up arcade games like donkey kong  pac man  space invaders  and many others from the very late 70s into the mid 80s and be content with that. no wokeism and those games are generally a lot harder than modern games are. I would have an in home arcade with the neon lights and it would be awesome.
they better stay away from the  dark brotherhood ... or my crew  the morag tong.  dont mess wit da tongs!
I remember back around 2010-2015 we were all excited about ubisoft and triple a games like splinter cell  driver  tom clancy  far cry  donald duck goin  quackers......but ghost recon you canthrow that in the trash. snoozeville!   but bring back driver at least!
to be fair  nintendo has the market cornered on gameplay. when you buy a nintendo game  youre buying it because of the gameplay. sony realized that they cant compete with nintendo on their own terms  which is why sony started focusing on games with movie-like experiences. and microsoft  since learning the same lesson after buying rare and failing to bring nintendo-like games to its consoles  has been trying to ride the line between the two. this is how the three companies offer something different from the competition  which is why its good to have all three. I do love your points  though  and its definitely not good for a aaa publisher such as ubisoft to focus on one more than the other. they should find a balance somehow  unless they can make a lot of money from a fortnite-type of venture  like epic games does.
why would kratos kill freya hes character isnt a insane murderer all the time.he killed most of the olympians for trying to stop him from killing zeus he wouldve spared helios if he told him how to kill him.and kratos has a sense of honor he didnt kill deimos his brother for trying to kill him at first why would he kill freya one of his few allies that helped save his own son you guys want basic bloodshed which I get its cool but they dont have to ruin the damn character and reasonings in order for it
kratos explains why he doesnt want to kill her.you insult her a lot but remember kratos killed her child and why exactly did kratos want to kill ares and zeus  for many trespasses against him one of them being the murder of his own first child.he understands her motivations more than anyone and the fact you cant see thatsays you dont even understand his character.complaining about gameplay changes is one thing but the takes you have here are just odd even terrible.
@chandler burse  no I understand kratos s character plenty its clear you dont understand him tho and neither do the new writers. kratos is a vengeful mortal who was wronged by the Gods he is blood thirsty and angry. they ruined his character in thos new series he has been severely nutered. the only terrible take here is these new games. they took the angriest man in video games and basically bitched him out. its a shame really.
I loved the devil may cry reboot. not everything about it works  but what does is fantastic.
I haven t even thought about ubisoft lately...why waste my effort
these people cant separate reality from fiction thats the problem
the only thing that will work is voting with your wallet.  do not buy games that pander to this new normal.  support indie developers that are still making games for gamers.  big studios need to be taught a lesson.
rainbow six siege is all I care about and they are doing fine .
the only time I enjoy playing as the bad guy is when Im darth vader then I ll happily reek havoc!...or that one time as venom...
listen listen  all good points but mario v rabbids was actually pretty good   its an xcom spyroish hybrid and has some decent gameplay
walked away from ubI some time back
the only reason game developers dont hire quadriplegics is out of hate.  diversity  representation  equity  equality
for me ubisoft died when they put mutants in tom clancy s  rainbow six.
only part I d disagree on is mario rabbids not being a  real game.  its definitely more for the nintendo audience and family friendly  but its a strategy game and not fully in line with mainline non-gamer tastes. other than that  everything else is right on the money. one has to remember that ubisoft has been chasing trends for a long time  were one of the first to embrace  the message   and have a lot of internal corruption with harassment and generally treating anyone not in the blub like garbage. like many  they were fantastic until they went mainstream with public investors  at which point creativity is left at the wayside for the latest money trend. of course they fail at them hilariously  from nft s to live service games. oh  and not really holding out hope for splinter cell. the modern audience curse is in full effect with this company.
I have to say. the witcher 3 was great for game play and the cutscenes were magnificent. the story line was supreme. witcher 3 wildhunt is everything you could want in an rpg game. another good game with great cutscenes and great playabilty  hellsword senua s sacrifice. I believe that both gameplay and great cinematic cutscenes can be done but the game companies are being paid by lobbyists  who are being funded by the governments of the world  to push their political agendas. lets face it....social agendas are political nowdays. just my thoughts.
thank you
this walking simulator narrative is not even remotely true. in fact I d argue games have way too much gameplay and are over 30 plus hours of non stop grinding  gameplay . it is seriously hard for me to find a game that is mainly focused on story telling which is my cup of tea now a days. it has mainly become a games for service industry.
oh well. I have no hope in the aaa companies. I dont care what a person s skin color is I just want a good game to play.
if gaming was still gaming  this year s second goty would be signalis. sorry people  I loved God of war  but its just simple button mashing between cutscenes.
5 05  have played evil genius  mass effect  full renegade run   and many star wars games and gone down the dark side path  kotor  just to name a few.  sometime being the bad guy makes for great entertainment.
mel you would have a good time playing video games with me I got the old school splinter cells I got splinter cell blacklist I got almost all the assassin s creed games from the first one all the way to valhalla
also a longtime gamer here  35 yo  and ive been following your vids for some months now  and they are all very accurate. whilst playing gow ragnarok even my girlfriend mentions the non-gameplay issues and changes of kratos and yes  also the wokieeness. first time I was tricked by reviews too  I kinda liked gow 2018 but ragnarok was so exhausting and just plain... not a videogame.
hey  Ive been hoping they d go belly-up for years...
this is because the real core of gamers is not only aging  but it was never as big as companies made it up to be. its not enough to sustain a bloated company like ubisoft  let alone whatever xbox is becoming. the culture wars are of course making it worse by shifting attention to audiences that never buy games and dead end anti-gamer causes.
canceling in-development games is nothing unusual especially game studios making cuts in light of the current economy. ever heard of the term  sunk cost and record capcom and sega themselves have also cancelled a slate of in-development.
one reason as to why I am a big fan of the old tie fighter game from lucasarts as well as the legacy of kain series as kain.
exactly  plenty of games in development and getting announced. especially sony  they have so much in play right now  tlou factions 2  horizon multiplayer and vr  spider-man 2  wolverine  forspoken  its crazy to be so negative and try to spin news like this to push your own agenda
5 secs in me   in pirate voice  arrrrrrrrgh matey...til never see the light of day
when talking about wokeness and identity politics the God of war franchise is not the example you want to use  kratos  change is a natural progression from where he ends in gow 3
well  what would you expect from ubisoft. frankly  supporting them and their practices are almost equally egregious.
the last game I played from ubisoft was tom clancy s h.a.w.x. it wasn t as good as the ace combat series.
we are not in 2010 anymore!!! just dance  of course its 24th game will be underperforming.
wasn t the last good game from ubisoft south park  the fractured but whole
ubisoft creativity died long before they went woke
I used to think I was growing out of games. over the past couple years I realized its not me  its them. games just suck now. the only game I have been able to really get into has been a pc game called oxygen not included. so many games these days have gotten too easy  too stupid  and or too boring. Imiss the days when I would spend months going platinum trophy hunting on ps3 and then ps4. the worst part of new games is all the dlc they attach that just try to milk people for every cent they can. they cant just make a good game anymore. they need to sale you part of a game and slowly drip out the rest of it at for a price. or go the episodic route and have you pay for 3 games thatshould just be 1.
when did the frag dolls get based
if people actually played all the God of war games  psp included  they should know that kratos personality actually didn t change that much. compared to the last two games.
you know they re degenerates when they started  shipping  redxiiI and barrett wallace.
this is the major problem with gen z gamers. they aren t gamers  they are activists posing as fans. they dont like games for the gameplay but for the social messaging they can display to others. they have appropriated our games to use as symbols for their social values. millennial gamers actually grew up in an area where gamers were still seen as  dorks  and  nerds . millennials were the ones who broke the mold and made gaming  cool . for gen z and beyond  gaming is just another mainstream form of media. its not a subculture like it was 15 years ago. same thing happened with comic books at about the same time and is now slowly starting to happen with anime.
genocide simulator... have you ever played a shooter... someone is getting killed in droves... but the gamer wins  so we are the good guys right  well except far cry 3  we are clearly the bad guy by the end. which I am okay with it was a great game  gotta love some ludonarrative dissonance.
maybe they will be the new joke like duke nukem.
Im not particularly interested in playing a harry potter game  the original ones on ps1 were great with 8 bit hagrid. although a  transphobic genocide simulator magic rpg  does sound like a nice change of pace
can I just have another prince of persia game   geez ubisoft.  really.
here s my 2 cents  you can make money catering to  non-gamers .but you know who s going to cut spending on  gaming  as soon as the money get tight  non-gamers   because gaming is literally non essential for them  even less important than netflix an other form of entertainment.gamers on the other hand will keep spending money on game even when money get tight because gaming is their main source of entertainment.
ubisoft is actually worse than ea at being good to its customers.
skull and bones  aww shit  we gonna play the bush dynasty in assassin s creed  american conspiracy.
yet they seem to colorized some aspect of norse mythology that doesnt make sense. I never heard of angrboda  atreus  gal pal  being looking black. itseems to a trend in the current entertainment industry and makes me wonder if the established media and hollywood has a zaddy fetish or has some diversters working for them.for the record  Im dark skinned too.
his personality wasnt ever this mindless killing machine he was always complex and was once a father before I argue kratos in 2018 is more truer to his self before he was indebted to ares and lost his family of course he is mentioned to be a glory seeker then but thats it mostly.
@chandler burse  indeed  but somehow people forget this. or just never played the games and understood them.
thissss!
I first saw this in the gaming media where one ign reviews ace combat 7 and gave it a rather average score citing on how difficult it was for him to complete the objectives while not getting shot down and was so tiring of dying over and over again to realize this........ all while playing the game on an easy mode control scheme.most of real gamer reviews and content creators here said that game was ace combat being back to true form.
I got to defend mario rabidz  it is a children s game.  it tries to replicate old school rgps with mario action.  it prepared my nephew for zelda breath of the wild.
yup  they wanted in on our fun when they were the type who laughed at us for playing. now it actually is mostly brain dead walk sims. nothing to play  not a game! not made for playing.thats the same term I use  they high jacked our games and hobbies.
I wonder if the change to more cutscenes is because its less coding  cutscenes require no little input from the controller so it makes it easier to develop and hence cuts the cost while also appealing to wider audience because nobody has to be a gamer to enjoy it  idk lol just a thought. costs less to make more and thats all they care about
all the cut scenes for these games are like watching avatar 1   2 a million times.
ubisoft has been disappointing lately.
I feel like you didn t really play the new gow games. there is 100  hours worth of content in each game. I have platinum on both.
stock price tanked as a result
skull and bones will probably release after I die  Im 45  having a big statue doesnt make you a massive fan
Im 47 so when I started playing games  it was not accepted by a large majority of people  and since Ive grown into adulthood  it really has become more accepted but I enjoy games that other people are saying are not games. for instance  I really enjoyed valhalla while I understand a lot of people did not like that game and thats fair. I spent a large amount of time with it and really enjoyed it. I played a lot of different types of games and I dont really care if one person likes this game or that game as long as they re having fun but I do understand why you dont want all games to be like whatever so not saying that youre gatekeeping  but I know all types of people that play games just like there s all types of people that watch movies and tv shows or whatever so thats just my opinion.
did prince of persia get canceled
Im not defending the act  but I know plenty of hardcore gamers that enjoy their cartoon corn. they do the weekly raids and hardest endgame content. it really is just professional activists that ruin gaming. I am sure anita sarkeesian doesnt touch cartoon corn.
just a question why is your facecam a lot bigger than most people  do you ever feel like it blocks the screen
this really does explain why people ask for more gay trans character  traits that adds nothing to a game or a nonsexual story  they just want to make fuel for their r34 fantasies. even now we got people trying to push the idea that luigI is gay for bowser in the mario movie all from a scene where bowser  though comically  was clearing torturing luigI for info on mario. Im all for some good adult fun but there has to be some boundaries or something.
well  it looks like skull and bones is not going to happen. I wonder if ubisoft is going out of business  well  they probably deserve it for their whole woke crap.
they refused to fix soft locks on the original mario rabbids... I reported them... wonder why no one bought the second one  after the tutorial and handholding  you got like 2 hours solo at the end...
I wouldn t say mario rabbids its a non-game its pretty hard you have to use a lot of your brain for it
it would be fine with me if ubisoft went broke. I have been done with them since they revealed watchdogs legion. that one made it pretty clear that they care more about pushing a political agenda than they do about making quality games.
honestly I usually agree with you melonie. but as far as God of war..  those games made the character grow into a positive strong male father. Im ok with that. the guy literally killed his first family  was kind of a shit father to atreus at first and showed him grow. and this is coming from a 41yr old gaming since atarI 2600  still love your content tho! agree to disagree!
having to witness this first hand and the type of games they do have active its honestly upsetting... crazy that the majority of the community involved with ubisoft games could care less about their views. quit forcing it onto a community that genuinely doesnt care. produce better quality games and quit pushing your agenda holy smokes... so many games gone to waste because they are pushing their agenda... smh
I couldn t agree more what you said about gow  kratos damn near close to being beta male.
I was bored to tears from the 2018 one  gameplay was too monotonous with no real substance. too much focus on story
Im the same. started gaming with pong. seen it all. played games with enough challenge that make me laugh at the  souls players . the real  gatekeepers  of gaming should be the ones who got socially ostracized for gaming back in the  80s and  90s if you ask me   but I digress. seems the younger generation dont appreciate adventure games. guess they dont see the merits in story telling and puzzle solving. now Im hearing people say a turned based strategy is a  nongame   mario   rabids   they might be a little too narrow minded in what they think gameplay is  turned based strategy is way more game than those action adventures they re all into anytime . kind of strange  because video games have become so eclectic these days  and thats what they ve mostly grown up with. I personally like games like the telltale variety that I guess they refer to as  movies . had a lot of fun making the worse decisions in the walking dead to screw up clementine as much as possible for laughs. felt like a game to me. but then I remember marveling over king s quest as a kid. its strange to me hearing this generation speak so narrowly about gaming  and do so like they have a clue what the  good ol  days  actually is  with total obliviousness of gaming history.
this video took a while to get out today  must be polished.  what is interesting in the world today
nobody wants to make a good game thatsells well. they want to make a game thatsells amazingly and quality is a distant secondary concern. also  what is this modern era of gamers  Im 42 and have played video games since I was 5. we never needed to be coddled. we never worried about the gender race sexuality of anyone involved. or needed political and social agendas crammed on us. we just wanted a fun game with a good story.
5 30 mass effect is a genocide simulator  in each installment of the trilogy you have a chance for either mass genocide or the genocide of an entire species.  me1 - rachnI  me2 - batarians   geth  me3 - all synthetic life
if you want to play an older  genocide  simulator  play hotline miamI 1 and 2.
we need elon to buy these companies so he can set it right. also  new gow is not gow. we have a Goddess of beauty who looks like a 50-year-old hippie. he doesnt get to be a good dad  he killed his daughter twice.
let them stop making games  or delays see where it takes them  they think they have us by the balls and we er sitting there in anticipation there s thousands of games we can still enjoy playing dont need ubI  matter fact many are tired of ubisoft  bs
its obvious they ve never played hatred
personally I just listen to what games the woke says is racist  sexist  homophobic  and all around toxic  because I personally take that as a ringing endorsement that Im going to have a great time playing whatever game they dont want me to play. basically the same thing rocky does with his girlfriend.  d
holy shit I just realized michael does life has been saying this for years and people think he s trolling
part of reason might be bleeding money on microtransactions people dont want and changing up the assassins creed formula to basically generic rpg
mario   rabbids under performed ...huh...didn t seem like it.
from reading your replies  it  seems to me that you dislike games that are too much story driven. so you basically want gamers  to read  an entire seperate blog post to  understand what the game s story lore  is actually all about . but  isnt the purpose of game play telling a story through the character that they are playing . that are then  added with challenges and making players feel rewarded for  completing them.   I see many people talking about game play and storytelling  as if they  are mutually exclusive. I think both play an important rol when making a game
03 12 this is another reason why  inclusion  is an anti-virtue. it turns the focus from quality -- which is enticing to all people -- toward completing an increasingly fractured and impossible checklist of partisan  tribal identity markers.  this in addition to the broader cause of decay  that including more and more intrinsically necessitates lowering standards.  exclusive  is a synonym for  elite  or  top quality  for very good reason.
is it too much to ask for a remaster of splinter cells 1-3 ..
does anyone know what the outro song is  I want to add the song to my playlist
majority of games are genocide simulators. you the player massacres thousands of enemies in a single playthrough. so yeah  genocide simulator sounds legit.
imagine if airplane companies started hiring people for identity politics instead of comptetences resulting in airplane crashes. and then if you complain about the crash you are a ist or a obe
hold on there miss mac go boom!mario   rabbids is a game  a challenging  fun game!
tbh  when then said  for modern audience  for splinter cell  I basically said   another  great franchise that is gonna get destroy by the woke cult  I have no expectation for this remake  now. thats the sad part. splinter cell is my favorite franchise from ubisoft.all aaa gaming companies went woke and or making basically the same game  just with a different skin on it. farcry3 and 4 are my faveswildlands was great. breakpoint was garbage. thats the sad part. rainbow six vegas 2 was the last great r6 gameassassin s creed up to syndicate are great  for me personally. origin  odyssey  valhalla are not part of the ac franchise. its their onw game.  black flag is the best now  Im mostly playing early access games  phasmophobia  sandrock  satisfactory  forewarned.playing jrpg  deep rock galactic and yeah!
well there goes rayman 4.
when do we genocide batarians in 2
@chandler burse  arrival dlc  300 000 batarian deaths due to shepard s actions. keep in mind Im not saying what shepard did was wrong it was a fucked situation but still 300 000 deaths I would say counts as genocide.
airplanes companies probably have done this but they would only still hire people who have actually learned how to pilot a damn plane.
@chandler burse  that d be reassuring  we never how far madness can go
@chandler burse  well I sure hope they dont. I want the best of the best  no matter the ethnicity or sexual orientation  especially for critical jobs such as airplane monitoring. I just dont know what to think after witnessing bad decision making driven by a woke narrative in american corporations
@romuald dussart  we already hire terrible people for police officers so yeah
if we were getting that though. rayman had been relegated to mobile games and apple arcade. although  what would have been his next mainline game
but  man  is such a problematic term  and they re not doing thatstuff anymore.it ll be  ray-person  or  ray-them  or something stupid to pander to the 1
wokeism takes alot of the spaces that we used to enjoy and turns them into echo chambers for their degenerate opinions. I used to love the old fable games where the best way to make money was to kill the villagers to buy up the npc property  sometimes being the villian is really fun.
big mistake to cancel splinter cells instead of skull and nobody cares.. if nothing else  this really shows how out of touch they are! altho one good thing in no sc reworks is that they cant ruin our fond memories with their  modern take on a classic  and other bs! I really hope yves will be forced to step down  I feel like he is one of the biggest reason why ubI is in a downward spiral!
the sex erasure replaced with body type sickness along with white erasure and overt black washing are why I pirate most of my games
first off genecide simulator does sound great but many games could have that tag.  how many koopas and goombas did mario snuff out  gears of war can b boiled down to two sides trying to completely eliminate each other  heck gow   og trilogy  kratos was on a murderous rampage of hate to kill all olympic Gods and I could go on. second I couldn t agreemore on the current state of gaming.  years ago I was saying that the cod  madden  fifa only players were casual.  hardcore gamers played many titles across genres but if you only buy cod u were casual even if u played it 10 hours daily.  but I would rather take those type gamers over a lot of the kind we have now. like you said   gaming becamecool so people whohated games tried to take it over. nerds used to b very open to share and talk about their hobby  sadly this allowed these people to come inand change it completely.sadly Im only 36and have regulated topretty much nintendo only gaming.  im willing to pass on games I want bc if a company produces three woke bs crapfests and insults fans but then makes 1 really interesting game doesnt mean Im willing to buy it.
just make rayman 4 ubisoft!!
the new hogwarts game could have been good. but seriously we need to boycott it because the devs gave in and added woke identity politics to the character creation in that game.
imagine how badass it would be if gta 6 actually made fun of woke liberals.
I dont care as long as the next ac doesnt make me pray for death 30 hours in.
I havent played anything ubisoft released since assassins creed odyssey. there is nothing they released since 2018 that interested me and nothing they are going to release looks interesting or even when it does I know they will f it up. the settlers 2023 one of my favourite oldschool series looks like nightmare and any aaa singleplayer game ubisoft releases has microtransactions. I just dont care. tencent will probably buy them in the future.
hey  I haven t play prince of persia  the sands of time  warrior within   the two thrones for the ps2   the assassin s creed series for the ps3   ps4 yet.hey captain optimistic  cut me some slack  will ya
skull and bones wasn t that a gamey game as a service  make your own fun game  you also seem to miss understand kratos. he was more of a tool than anything.
searching for skull and bones lead to a lot of male bikinI ads.... I hate you google.
I do not like the new ac games  they strayed from feeling like assasins and the developer even quoted...  people will still love it even without assassins.  there are gamers who love gameplay but also love a good story  but I think there needs to be a good balance. I love things like mass effect and dragon age but hated mass effect andromeda... I will play laid back games that are just things like house flipper and things... just if I want to take a break from killing things or the sims. I am looking forward to hogwarts legacy and I am not even a fan of harry potter. but the story and gameplay look so awesome... but because of outrage people almost lost the game for switch  xbox one and ps4. but a new article came out saying it is coming out now. if a game lets u choose ur own story  I always play the bad guy and kill everyone I come across. lol
I gotta say  mario rabbids 2 is amazing. but holy shit  they killed just dance with this 2023 version. got it for my daughter for xmas. its a dlc code in the case  40 blah songs   and you cant use your unlimited account. it needs a new sub  called just dance plus. terrible practice to a game my 9yr old loves
I stopped buying ubisoft games  years ago. even before the woke pandering  their games became stale  and stagnant.  the last few games I have from them  came with hardware purchases.
Imean... I have a separate save file to commit genocide eveytime I play an open world game.
you could really tell what ubisoft s beliefs were if you look at their games  especially in assassin s creed. if you look at the very first game you play a muslim assassin fighting Christians. in assassin s creed syndicate you have to save or help charles darwin and karl marx the founder of communism. I hope this company either goes completely broke or they leave this communist woke ideology that they have been peddling for so long!!!!!
find this to be the result when everyone thinks they re a  kojima ...
meanwhile Im playing through the mass effect trilogy for the first time  and its really brought to light how western game developers have been dropping the ball
they are making  samantha fischer  a transspecieal  omnisexual  non gender-confirming  atheistic anarchist poc the primary protagonist for the new splinter cell.
the choker looks really good on you.
the hogwarts game is weird one...its an rpg. protagonist shouldn t be a good guy necessarily. what s a problem with introducing let s say terrorist goblin faction that fights for goblin rights  at least its not as dull as  voldemort is evil cause he s evil . its so much better for the woke movement to have that in the game cause some players will relate to that. yes they are  villains  cause they associated themselves with dark magicians or what not  from what I understand at least  but they fight for something thatshould be granted.oh geez  moral dilemma in my game ! not on my watch! just make player fight for goblins cause thats what we like! no thinking needed!!! or I ll call you antisemitic!what a stupid take.
its better this way less ubI games   better life
actors  real actors  have said for years playing a well written villain is much more fun than playing the hero.   so it makes sense gamers would like to play the villain once in a while. 5 18
I stopped caring about assassins creed after origins. feel like all the main characters have no personality to meet the woke cults ideals. as for the accessibility argument thats dumb I have aspergers and a learning disability and was able to play video games since I was 6 in 1986.
I just to trade the ubisoft  stocks. now I dont even trust ubisoft any more to make a proper game.
lol the person that made that comment has never played mortal combat and pulled someone s spinal column out of there body
since ubisoft feels like cancelling things I have some suggestions...ubisoft connect ...its the worst. get rid of it.pre-game virtue signaling ...we dont care how many marginalized people were involved in making the game. we just want the game to start. get on with it!epilepsy warnings ...really  I can appreciate your trying to protect the 6 or 10 gamers out there who might be triggered by a flashing screen  but at least give the 11 billion of us who dont suffer from it the option of hitting the escape key.
we need to erase the word gamers from the vocabulary.this is why the pcmr existed.now we have a bunch of xbot s and sony ponies that never belonged on a pc in the first place. they are indoctrinated in the xbox live pay to play to pay to play the game you ve already paid for.I firmly believe that if all the console kiddies never built pcs in the last seven or so years  we would still have games that were actual games.take cyberjunk for instance. the game was completely destroyed because they wanted to make it for consoles itshould have never been even released for in the first place.that game completely confirmed the reality that they dont make actual full release games anymore.Imean  if youre old enough to remember super nintendo or even ps1. if youreleased one bad game on snes  your studio and you were never heard from again.imagine if they released a game as groundbreaking as the first ghost recons or the first assassin s creed.unfortunately games are rapidly becoming all pay to win mobile trash in disguise.look at the menu for modern warfare 2 mw22. that was designed by mobile game designers if you look at it.it makes absolutely no sense on a pc but it fits perfectly into the mold of turning all new games into incomplete at launch that you then have to pay for the features they leave out spending another 60 to  70 on a game you ve already spent  70 on just youremain relevant
its not that I disagree about modern aaa games being boring as hell  indie games been dope as shit lately though so people need to just go play a good boomer shooter like ion fury  amid evil  or postal brain damage  but I will say that whole rant felt so out of place with the article sighting the failings of mario   rabbids  the xcom clone for baby gamers  and just dance  the game for twitch thots to please their simps with  since those dont really line up with the cinematic games   bad narrative you got going still dont disagree but still.
what kind of gamer does not know what rule 34 is
because of all the these weirdos talking trying to tell everyone not to buy the game because it doesnt completely conform to their demands and because of something that the author spoke her opinion Im gonna preorder it as my way to flip a double birdie at them because Im sick and tired of them trying to tell me how to think and what I can and can not say  I for one truly believe in freedom of speech and if I dont agree with someone Im big enough to accept that and move on  what I dont do is try to force my opinions on anyone else and when people who cant accept thatsomeone has different opinions than them start verbally attacking me instead of having a mature conversation I just block them and forget about them
I dont agree with the opinion about kratos. he didn t  changed   he  matured . makes little sense he be the kratos he was now that he has a kid  and how he lost his first family. he would never let that happens again.it would go against his character to be who he was now he is a father again.
mechanics matter most.
cig and star citizen are the last bastion of gameplay innovation and healthy dev culture.
they dont even know what gamers like. thats just awkward and embarassing. they dont know anything about fun  about jokes  about irony  about entertainment overall. just sad  how empty their lifes must be. but they should stop to take others stuff away  and get a real life and a hobby instead. I feel bad for them for having such a sad and empty life  but it doesnt justify destroying every form of entertainment ever invented in human history.
not only they make cinematic experiences but their stories suck.I want fallout to have a great dreading atmosphere and important story again  and the main character not shouting  shawn  every secondI want mass effect to be able to be finished without money-heads pressuring the development team and making them release it without an ending.I want game s stories to not be bad. storywriters must be gamers as well. this is the witcher netflix effect all over again. writers mocking the material and doing whatever to cash in  resulting in bad stories for games.I want fun games focused on gameplay  without pay to win microtransactions.  loot boxes must be removed.I want competitive games to have real  identification measures and anticheat that works  with active administrators ingame to resolve issues and ban cheaters on the spot.one can only dream.
I rolled my eyes when they made female eivor canon in ac valhalla. everybody agreed that male eivor was better and it made sense because male eivor was more accurate to history. female eivor sounded like somebody thatsmoked 24 7 for 50 years straight. they may as well make the female option the only option in future games cause there isn t a point with the male option if they are just going to go with female.plus its so stupid they waited until the content was done with valhalla to add the option to have a hood on all the time  in a assassin s creed game!!!!!!!!!
I think the change with God of war is fine cuz he had a kid and before when he had a kid he lost said kid the kids of things that can all change a man
could you imagaine if they played    soldier of fortune
Im on about hogwarts legacy
he s not supposed to be a father tho... he is the God of war. he doesnt get to have a mortal s life.
@raymond karl veasey  I wouldn t want the same treatment done to kain in the legacy of kain series. Im more forgiving of kratos being a father but the current industry better not  f ck around with kain or raziel.
@raymond karl veasey  but all he wanted is a family. thats why he turned into the God of war in the first place  because of what happened to his family.its only natural that he  after settling down  would try to build a family again. and make sure this time  things would be different.
I agree. if any female should have been canon itshould have been kassandra  she was cool. female eivor was more like eibore
this is how I feel about bioware usually making male shep seemingly canon I dont think they ever did. but jennifer hale is just a better shepard than mark meer in my opinion.
also why even have a canon character  most games like this often say  its your choice  and just try to write around that in the later games.
just like vocaloid alienating real singers  aI art alienating artists  phone camera tech and apps alienating photograpers. dumbing down and enforcing accessibility in game is where you alienate core gamers in favor of a more subjective of casuals.  when something goes mainstream  so does its principles . its all about the massive   now.
they have been beating the assassin s creed horse to death. and they cant seem to come out of any other project. and they try to go woke with any that do come out. skull and bones could be a great pirate game but they want to just make itship battles online which is lame.
glad to see someone else call out the new God of war games  I dont even consider 2018 or ragnarok  God of war  they re just complete toned down versions specifically for modern audiences that are too soft to handle the older games  the classics were far better than the new ones.
the first  ass ass in screed  was rubbish. when I reached a new area  I just scanned the entire area like the beam of an old crt tv  murdering everyone and interacting with every icon except for the guy who d tell me what to do. after cleansing the entire town I d finally meet my boss who d send me to fight the boss right away
one of these days this push agenda s things and dont care about a game. when they lose money with this approach they ll learn.I have no clue how it hasn t happened yet. quit giving them your money. you give splinter cell the people that will make it right. not suits. but yeah ubisoft is terrible right now. rayman is forgotten by these suits. gaming is gonna downfall till they get it together pretty soon. this goes for every company including crystal dynamics and etc.
I would love to comment my full feelings about these weak minded cry babies but there isn t enough room. lol but as a guy with a few years gaming  I started with the atarI 2600  I fully back mel s take. she s not wrong in the slightest.
I used to want to play beyond wokie evil 2.   but that project seems soo off track. I ll stick to avatar  and the new starwars game.
all industry needs to go back to a meritocracy ideology and ditch this whole  for lack of a better term   woke  ideology. your skills  talents and accomplishments should be what matters not the  diversity checklist . itshouldn t matter if you identify as a non binary toaster  your skills and experience should be what matter.
I rather have more gameplay and less cutscenes lmao
remember what happened with cuphead
you just dont understand  that weird 40 year old guy who dresses like a japanese school girl and plays with little girl toys is their target audience.
they should cancel beyond good and evil 2.  I have been waiting for this sequel since ronald raegan left office.
another problem with modern games is the endless exposition from characters that makes you play the game in a meandering way where you dont want to do anything until the dialouge is finished so you dont accidentally cut off the characters and miss lore or something interesting  looking at you God of soy . also characters sperging out about puzzle solutions. waste my time more whydontcha -_-
current western video game developers have also handed over their writing rooms to the woke cult. stories are terrible right now. even generally lauded games like horizon forbidden west   God of war ragnarok have crap narratives full of woke tropes like passive men  condescending women  mary sues    leftist political ideals  colonialism  environmentalism  identity politics . we are just so beaten down  we think we ve won when the writers arent spitting in our face  and merely subtly giving us the middle finger. totally agree with you about God of war.
skull   bones is doathe big reveal was a massive disappointment
as a conservative.  God of war ragnarok is an excellent game.  play it.  you wont regret it.
its go broke  get woke. its all about esg. they no longer care about the customer. they care about their social creditscore.
at this point can we just get a woke game that just takes itso ridiculously far it becomes hilariously entertaining   I would play as a lesbian male to female who identifies as a rabbit and the goal of the game is to sneak around a post apocalyptic world where 90  of the land is used as vegan farmland and since the fascist conservative farmers stole our habitat we have to sneak in to steal carrots while dodging confederate flag poles thrown at us like spears.  oh and the rabbit is indigenous.  almost clicked send without proofreading for privilege  sorry.
I loved assassins creed since the first one and longer than I probably should have. I didn t even hate origins or odyssey  though they are nothing like the original. black flag and rogue were the last ones I actually had fun with  mostly for the ship combat  even though they were deeply flawed. I just got valhalla on deep discount  I think I am finally done with the franchise. I am not even going to finish it. the story is boring  I skip all the cut scenes  the gameplay is a buggy mess and there is nothing remotely entertaining about it. I am not a tomb raider fan in particular  its ok I just never got into it  but it is the same feeling as I think you have. it hurts to see something you loved bastardized into an unrecognizable mess.
lost faith in ubisoft after far cry 6
I played the older ones and quite frankly on easy mode they are a bit more difficult than the new ones but I cant even deal with regular enemies on the harder modes in any of them including the new ones.beyond removing platforming and a bunch of items.the structure is overall the same except more cinematic now. you adventure solve basic puzzles and then fight a large amount of sometimes repetitive enemies  albeit 2018 suffers the most from this my biggest complaint is that they made the executions in 2018 a thing that only occurs with certain enemies and you cant choose the execution method anymore.
I wont deny it  I think horizon has fantastic art direction and world design  and it really seems to emphasize gameplay over just being endless cut scenes. it can really put up a fight if youre faced with a slaughterspine  thunderjaw  stormbird  etc. however  the ending to forbidden west was awful.I remember zero dawn s ending got me excited for the sequel  especially the scene where sylens gets ahold of the hades a.i. but what happens at the end of forbidden west  turns out elisabet was a lesbian  and or bisexual  all along  because writing is hard    and she was in a relationship with far zenith member  tilda. but elisabet eventually turned tilda down and tilda never got over it........ even after a thousand years. lol wut  what  what even is this then when tilda learns aloy is elisabet s biological descendant  she basically wants to kidnap aloy into space and essentially groom aloy.what. the. actual. heck. guerilla. unnecessary lgbtp  pandering. grooming. even needlessly killing strong male characters like varl. forbidden west was pretty fun  but then lost its mind at the end.
also spoilers  but since the game went so woke at the end  who even cares
nah Im good  hated the one before it. bored to tears
@melonie mac go boom  this one is different.  way better writing.  I promise.  I like ragnarok better than the last one.  just curious  do you prefer ps5 or xbox   no fan war.
@david abrams  its an interesting take on norse mythology. I still wished the gameplay was good with the too human game all those years back to warrant a sequel. I d like to see ragnar k in that game.while I can forgive kratos being a father  I absolutely do not want the current gaming industry to change or alter what made playing kain or raziel from the legacy of kain series so fun. I still love playing a pure anti-hero.
imagine only playing games that align with your political beliefs tho. are youreally that fragile and need to live in a bubble
@zoloft77  maybe its because Im about to become a father.  but I get what your saying.  yes we cant let the older gameplay style die as well.  just like mario 3d and 2d
@underthegun897 woke should be banned in gaming and movies.  someone has to make that a law.  some gaming has woke and a lot doesnt.  movies could be beyond if.
I stopped much of the assassin s creed upon knowing the developers stopped their lead-up with the protagonist and the factions facing juno since her release in the third game.
splinter cell is going to be a a complete flop. everyone knows that ubisoft is going to gender race swap sam fisher  the story is going to be generic  and the gameplay is going to be dumbed down and boring for all of the mouth breathing aretards at kotaku and reset ere. this is the reason why if I even play games anymore  its something from over 10 years ago in my steam library. there hasn t been anything worth my buck in recent memory except for rr2  and gow.
alot of what you say is why the indie market is booming!!
kratos doesnt even  collect   red orbs from women anymore
I believe the character arc kratos goes on is superb and doesnt fully fall under the umbrella description of  activism ruined another character . but I do understand your point of activism ruining alot of characters
splinter cell 1 and 2 the best
you raise good points on woke shit ruining games but I disagree that thats what they did with God of war. in og God of war he was tricked into killing his daughter and wife which threw him into the rage we saw in the first 3 games. he wanted aries power to defend his land. he is the same loving dad he was before but this time he actually has something to lose. he has to be a wholesome dad because he doesnt want atreus to turn into him
have 0 hope for skull   bones at this stage.
I just disagree with you about kratos  he s the same he s always been  kratos has always been a family man since the old ps2 games  he killed the God who tricked him into killing his own daughter and wife in order to make him    the perfect warrior    the scene of his dead family in his own arms haunted him so much that he tried to kill himself by jumping from a cliff after the Gods denied to free him from the memories of that night. also  in gow chains of olympus kratos is willing to give up on everything just to stay with calliope in the elysium but he realizes its not possible because a mad Goddess wants to destroy the whole world including the underworld  so he just pushes her away as she hugs him and do what has to be done.to sum up  he s always been a family guy who loved them above anything else and when they were taken away from him he burned down an entire pantheon on his own just to avenge their death  he s just become wiser and more mature over the years.
yeah - where gow2018 was a somewhat believable character arch for kratos  realizing the repeating cycle he s part of can be a choice . ragnarok however was not kratos.
Ive find this unfair
yeah  your take on the new God of war games is insanely bad. lolfirst  if you  take away  the graphics  story and cutscenes of any game  youre not left with much  substance.  so that right there is a ridiculous argument.second  kratos has changed as a character. he has learned from his past that being the antI hero he was  wasn t the best way to live his life. sure he was a badass  but he still is now too. he has grown as a character and now was trying to leave his past behind  love his wife and son and live a fulfilling life.youre talking like they ve retconned him into this character or just outright changed him on a whim and thats simply not the case.
genocide simulator tag could be applied to many games. when I think about it  in most of the games that I played I comitted genocide. I slew thousands of orks  bandits  cultists  soldiers  beasts etc. I eradicated whole tribes  even countries  and persecuted foreign religions and cultures. I was exterminating sick people. and all this in the name of the greater good or for arbitrary goal. the same with capitalism tag. I was even participating in organ trade and in slave trade. and most of money I earned in games was from killing people.
honestly  you are confusing things here. I am a gamer  and I am a game dev for a big publisher. you telling me  that the games Imade are not desined for core gamers is quite the insult. please dont pack everyone on the same shelf  by generalizing them. especially pulling people from outside with their comments in the same pot as the people actually making the game. you are doing a huge disservice towards people  who show their engagement and commitment during development. the artists  who put their sweat and blood into making assets and animations look incredible  for example. try to draw a line there and put some more thoughts into it.
on anothet note  I dont understand why you hate cinematic games so much  Im doubly confused at why you blame games urinalists for their increased popularity  totally has nothing to do with technology and gaming both evolving in tandem with one another . just because dean takahashI sucks at cuphead doesnt mean I cant enjoy uncharted  detroit become human  and other games with similar approaches to storytelling.
what s a non gamer if they play video games   I play every genre under the sun.  anything from sims to dark souls.  literally everything in between. so if you play games aren t you then a gamer   what is a  legit gamer
this is why we should go back to gate keeping our hobbies. too many normies and woke npcs have infected the industry. I haven t enjoyed a unbisoft game since the prince of persia trilogy and assassin s creed 2.
here my friends in lies the problems. think about it for a second  we  the real gamers are disappointed by the crap they re pushing yet this crap keeps selling...  why  simple  because the average person can now get in because of the difficulty reductions in the name of accessibility. not saying this is a bad thing  as if done right it can bring us all together  give those hardcore pros a chance to help those less skilled  but nope... instead the aaa industry want to pander to woketivists for social clout. now  as a note to my accessibility complaints  the  accessibility features  they re getting so much praise for implementing are simple enough things that they could have done them years ago  and in some cases  did do them years ago but were ignored for doing so. for context  Im a legally blind individual who has been gaming since the days of the atarI 2600 so if anyone wants to have a little chat about accessibility in mainstream games Im more than happy to do so  but in most cases these aaa studios are either going too far with accessibility or not far enough. tlou2 goes too far because by the end of setting everything up you could have a game that quite literally plays itself and at that point why bother buying a video game  the new God of war doesnt go far enough because while they do use color to mark important things  what about people who are color blind  and dont even get me started on those crappy full screen  color blind filters...  the woketivists are using accessibility as a crutch argument here. yes  there are people like me pushing for accessibility in gaming but what we want is the opportunity to play and overcome the same challenges as everyone else  not to have those challenges simplified for us. I get it  some disabilities do require some concessions but thats why minor assists can exist. celeste is honestly a game that does accessibility right. even if you turn on every assist option  you still need some mechanical skill to complete each level  the game wont play itself.
gow 3 was stupid and a complete deviation of his character while God of war 2018 was closer to the character that we got in the backstory of God of war 1 and chains of olympus. people thatsay kratos was always simply just a bad guy and a murderer only jumped into God of war series on God of war 3  which site know God of war 3 head the least amount of content
I agree with 99  of what you say  but I am kind of surprised that as a Christian you are against accessibility. I have talked with some of the people pushing for accessibility in games and they are just people with some kind of disability who want to play games. unless you are referring to a different kind of accessibility push I am not aware of.matthew 25 40 niv the king will reply   truly I tell you  whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine  you did for me.
can we get an updated rainbow 6
what fucking activism  a man who once genocided Gods and fell to a cycle of killing his father who did the same to his and realizes that he cannot let fate and cycle control him. nor should he let conflicts occur without his own efforts what activism is melonie on about  did she even play these games theres definitely some messages but kratos arc doesnt feel like an activist and it fits his character even from the originals such as understanding why freya wants to kill him and he wouldve done the same as he did do. and he is honorable and wouldnt kill someone who helped him as greatly as her. but people just see that and go  dur dur feminist sjw messaginginginging! its irritating.
I dont really know ragnarok was somewhat lackluster to my expectations but I was fine with kratos arc.
oh man  I usually agree with you but I have to hard disagree that real gamers dont want a game with a lot of gorgeous cut scenes. those kind of games are not just skin deep  there s been a lot of really moving moments in some beautiful cut scenes that have absolutely made the game for me. im actually kind of stunned by this take
cancel everything and make a new prince of persia.
genocide simulator  so dynasty warriors
u can not tell me what I cannot saaaaay
people upset at the  genocide simulator  thing obviously never played sim city.
why  why are they doing this
its like the gamers have to become the developers cause they sold out. anybody wanna pay for my 400 000 tuition
sooo japan  whatcha got coming next
she looks so gorgeous
they kill my favorite game  prince of persia and dont make any rayman anymore
beyond good and evil spinliter cell are probably been cancelled for the woke.
Im not gonna buy it
they may be gamers but they are mostly abusers.
gaming companies need to hire people who played almost every genre in video games that  want to be in the industry . not non-gamers who dont the what the fuck parkour is and use their political ideology to influence children.
prototype
are you getting the new tomb raider game by amazon
but joel isn t a good guy at the end of the last of us  he killed all the people at the end that was trying to save humanity for his selfish gains  yea he wanted to protect her but its still quite evil.
what happened with the stalker
who else would buy a game called  genocide simulator   xd
so your one of the people who shoots me on red dead online lol.
hard disagree with your hard disagree. gamers enjoy gameplay. movie-watchers enjoy movie-scenes. movies are not games.
@bouitaz  thats... not even remotely true. a game can be a combination of both. Im not going to argue about what makes someone a gamer since there are a ton of different kinds of gamers  and being one type does not exclude you from being a gamer. the reality is that gaming has expanded beyond polygons climbing ladders and platforming.
90  sure I will not  it would take a miracle for me to want anything to do with it. tomb raider has been desecrated
@melonie mac go boom  I wish I could be as sure as you. I cant resist a tomb raider game even though I hate the changes they made to her over the past decades... Imight not get it though if they go too far with the desecration of my beloved lara croft.
cops are still handling it  I dont really have updates at the moment tho
genocide simulator does sound like fun.
altogether too woke programmers.
I dont agree with you on the God of war part Ive played all of them. there was nothing woke about God of war. like in the older ones  kratos did show some emotion. in the new ones had just as much action an chaos in it.  but also telling a story about father and son. and kratos trying to raise his son to be a strong man. but I get what youre saying but I disagree still love your content.
why do I keep getting an ad from a pron actress talking about her stepson in the beginning of your videos
game these day are more like how much political crap I put in the game and force my ideals to the gamers. most aaa game aren t fun anymore it just about trying to ignore all the idealism while trying to just play a game to just joy it.
ubisoft used to make decent games back in the day. but over the past 8 or so years they have been trying to turn games into a fast food item. none of their games have any passion or innovation  its all cookie cutter garbage.
ubisoft is canceling games  for what
dont let efap hear your slander of gow
whoa you dont even look 36  thats good jeans
mel mac  a.l.f. s home planet
goooooo boooom  d
there is progression in the God of war games. people can change just as kratos changed. did not see your point or correlation when bringing up gow. gameplay is also not one of the most important things. how are characters  and story too  there are a few things there that make games great not just one thing.
ubisoft should have cancelled s b instead.
no! mebehard!
its all gone
modern gaming is the death of gaming.we re done  its over.been fun.see ya in the next renaissance.
with the cost of living crisis and the energy crisis  where do these execs think the money is coming from  of course sales are falling  people can barely afford to heat their homes  never mind spend upwards of 50 on a game. and thats before you get into the woke shit turning customers off.
go woke go broke I stopped buying anything from these guys long ago just like square enix
mario and rabbids 3 and maybe dlc is canned. the second is considered a failure
even the games with stories arent as good as they were ... best game with stories are also coming from japan ... f.e by exemple
because their social-justice lectures are losing them money.they re finding out virtue doesnt pay the bills
meh  the only franchise I follow from them is... wait  there is not a single franchise from ubI that I like.
ubisoft has gotten worst over the years...
skull and bones is gonna be a shitshow. they would cancel it  nut they cant because the took money from the singapore government.
boycottwokegames
Im curious what your thoughts on the last of us 1. strip that off the story and you d see the gameplay is lame and subpar.
so if they do like comics   tv and movies  its simple...... they will lose sales. tough sh!t for them. get woke go out of business and hope indie comicsgate types start making games.
ubisoft is going hard into mobile games that requires less work more mtx more sheeps spending their parents money more profit for ubisoft.
keep on hiring people who dont have any knowledge of gaming history or any type of background that actually contributes to creating a game and youre not going to have any customers all the true gamers are going to just leave and you ll be another company shut down you will be looking like disney losing money and being screwed because you want to cater to people who dont even buy your games and dont meet a damn thing because they want to shove their agenda down people s throats so keep up the good work because sooner or later you going to fall too
youre 36!  I thought youre 27 or 28
Im 47 years old  Imiss just turning on whatever console system I had back then  turned the system  and just play the whatever fucking game I was playing back then. now I have I have to give my blood type number  my dna id number  the name I have to give to my 3rd vertebrae near my back of my neck  or wherever it is. dont forget to u up load  and update the fucking game just to start playing the fucking game.
who to blame sony  ubisoft  activision blizzard and I like their games from both sides  ea  embracer  square enix because of greed and 2k sucks.
people are getting too judgy and knit picky. and too woke. I think its time for society to hit reboot. we are shooting ourselves in the foot
I hope the splinter cell remake gets cancelled.  I dont want to see that masterful franchise remade for the  modern audience.
basically if there s no gay people  they re worried it wont sell  when in reality it wont sell if thats one of the selling points.
the word youre looking for is porn  not corn
eh  haven t bought from ubisoft in about 9 or 10 years.
skull and bones looks like garbage.  I was hoping being able to go out on land and do stuff with my ship crew like old school sid meirs pirates.
you wanna talk sometime ! ! positive energy only  but constructive criticism is acceptable.
I think ubisoft has been shit long before the woke stuff started to permeate the gaming sphere.
melonie mac so cute
agree
looks like youre unaware of how youtube will demonetize people for using words lol
@melonie mac go boom  I am aware  I just wanted to express that I loathe censorship
I feel bad for the people that like ubisoft  but in my opinion they haven t had a good game in awhile. its all just check lists of nothing with weak gameplay.
go woke go broke .
beautiful graphics.. please  kick behind combat gameplay
checklists over merit and bending the knee to a small psycho portion of society. needs to change.
but if activists just want to see the characters on rule34 then why do they push for females to look grotesque this worlds timeline is confusing lol
look at kindafunny they got rid of colin and thats when I stopped watching them
so Im a non gamer for liking cinematic games like uncharted or the last of us
lol skull and bones is dead on arrival.
ubisoft is french isn t it  pandering and being  woke  makes perfect sense.
accessibility is really for gamers that cant play normally. now playstation making thier own accessibility controllers for gamers who are disabled.  hopefully all these companies stop with this gimmick for marketing
were my boy rayman
go retro. where the proper games are.
speculations are just speculations
ubisoft wants diversity and inclusion
the last of us 2 was so bad. Im still mad over joel s death. I canceled my preorder when the leak happened. sucks there was a leak but Im happy it happened so I didn t waste my money.
the only things I dont like about last of us  is when people talk about joel.
youre 36    I thought you were like 25.
wow! youre 36  youre beautiful.
your not talking about the last of us. your not talking about uncharted.your not talking about God of war.your not talking about horizon.nobody ever called assassin s creed a walking simulator.
sob looked shit when someone leaked it from a play test.
like I said in the video  if thats all you play then yeah lol
retro is almost all I play any more
@melonie mac go boom  same. old fighting games from capcom  mgs  and fromsofts stuff.
still got my snes plugged in too
25-36 is a blur. all good if you keep yourself healthy!
their games of late are underwhelming anyways
oooof extremely wrong take on sparks of  hope
its ok from software will always be good because american woke politics cant get involved.
you know God of war is more gameplay then story right
haven t brought a ubisoft game since 360 days and Im gonna keep it that way this company is garbage
hImelonie.
I like mario rabbids  wasn t terrible  but at the same time theres no real way to push identity politics into those games. which is still better than woke games. just saying
games now a days have gone woke straight garbage.
ubisoft lost all my good will when they did whatever the hell they did to beyond good and evil 2.looks like some california zoomer trash.
I really hope they didn t cancel prince of persia
they say that gaming is hijacked   d by who  woke people. wokeness is a desease  it is a force of quality reduction.
real simple  stop pandering to the rainbow mafia and make great fun games especially if it offends the screamers who dont buy your products
Im the stalker
Im just gonna say it.  ubisoft died after ac iv.
ubisoft died long ago I dont care if they cancelled there games and stuff as I have most of there older games.
I only care about assassin s creed  ghost recon  far cry  splinter cell  watch dogs
the only game I give a fuck bout from ubisoft is the splinter cell remake the put in production as an apology for making that battle royale tom clancy bullshit and the splinter cell remake is still in prototype stage so still have no game direction lol
its gonna be a black female samantha fisher.
after assassin s creed valhalla... when thay made odin a women but advertised it with him as a man...... yeah ubI can get lost.
playstation has been pretty successful with their games so I have to disagree with you. their big games sell no less than 5 million copies within a year aka gow  horizon  got and tlou. holy I disagree so much with what u consider a game. ubisoft is in this situation because their management is bad  not because their games are bad.
not very good gameplay. I got so bored.
video games peaked with 16-bit and 32-bitthis new stuff is a bore fest
idc about any of this.where is beyond good and evil 2
sheeit  to hell with aaa games.  haven t bought one in years.  I ll just keep playing wreckfest.
aaa gaming will be dead in the next 10 years  it has already been in shambles for a while now and its only getting worse year by year...
you think sam fisher was cool  wait until you see his final form  samantha fisher. she is a stunning and brave demisexual transgender woman. she is also the stealthiest woman to ever don a pair of heels.
costs money to add women  trans  non binary  and furries to every game.   thatsaid  immortals fenyx rising was the best game they ve made in years and itsold like sh t.
ubisoft was the pioneer of shit gaming  how could anyone be surprised
play elden ring and shut up!  b
thats what you get for liking anything except cod.
maybe ubisoft needs to stop making bloated open world games and stuffing them full of microtransactions. I cant stand their games anymore  its like cancer in videogame form.
well  let s be honest here.  we are talking about ubisoft  one of the worst game publishers on the planet.  so really  who cares
mario   rabbids is a non game  tell me you have no clue what you are talking about. a tactics rpg a really challenging one at that is a non game now. riiiiight. the only complaints reviews had was it was too hard
I have the perfect business model for gaming  fire all the mbas and promote the nerdy asian guys wearing plaid shirts to work every day to director positions. print billions and repeat.
stopped caring about ubisoft games. they re open world side quest slogs that are uninteresting  bland   soul-less rinse and repeat titles.Im sure there are people out there that absolutely love ubisoft  but sorry  Im not one of them. no offense.
mel says the word gaymer for 15 minutes.
they dont make good games. it doesnt matter. I haven t liked any of their games since the division 1.
mario plus rabbids was their last good game. they haven t been really good since the 2000s.
lots of people like the story telling adventure  walking simulators  but the stories are sjw ass
your right but Imassively disagree with you on God of war
last semI decent ubisoft game I played was origins  its been going downhill since and Im glad  they deserve to burn
I got it mixed up with the party game  probably one reason why it didn t sell well lol
wait a minutedid you just call mario rabbids a non-game angry nintendo-fan screeching
wokies have ruined gaming for sure. im hoping the dead space remake isnt super woke because they are adding dialogue and a bunch of stuff  they already changed character models and made isaacs gf look old and ugly as hell
the only game I enjoyed from them is  immortals fenyx rising . they are meh. not big of a loss.
thats what you get for getting more busy making diversity departments instead of games
good should just stop entirely black flag should have been the end
skull and bones was gonna be woke trash tho. good riddance.
no good
I want to play video games not movies I really wish these video game companies would just do what they re best at make video games. stop listening to fake gamers who dont even play games also stop listening to reviewers and critics and actually listen to your own real customers
they need to delay their assassin creed franchise. valhalla was a hot pile of shit
wow you are so pretty
wow  I was with you right up until you said the new God of war games have no substance lmao you must be high
first
I wish they would cancel assassins creed already thatseries has turned to shit
Imean does anyone really want to play skull   bones  it looks terrible...
ubisoft sucks anyway so whatever
those are not games they are called  interactive movies   they are meant for other demographic not gamers.
I think western game developer should stop making video games and just let japanese make video game because japanese developer know what they want
imagine saying God of ragnarok is woke lol. you literally got thor and kratos two alpha chads destroying their surrondings in the game lol. I dont like woke stuff but this is just complaining for the sake of complaining. youre no different than the woke mob. kratos being a dad is wholesome tbh he has more character development than most male characters today who are ruined by identity politics. so dont say oh him being a dad sucks now because in todays society dads are demonized but God of war ragnarok showed a positive side to that relationship
fake gamers  what exactly is a fake gamer  lol hahaha
off topic why is arkane  a studio full of white people  making a game based in the whitest islands in the country  and excluding white people as playable characters amung 4 choices
I thought it was the party game  not tactics one. that was my bad lol!
@melonie mac go boom  okI accept your apoligy
aw thank you
we been playing  genocide simulators  since the 8 bit days.  p whether it be people  alien  or monster  male or female  we dont discriminate.  p
nobody cares about you ubisoft so nobody cares that these games are cancelled
ubisoft games suck anyway so no loss.
ubisoft is a terrible company. all of their games from the last 5 to 8 years are generic and just boring. whoever enjoys their crap has a very low standard...
hey  why dont you unblock me. Imiss showing my support and positive energy ! !
hey melanie  guess who s b-day celebration is on the 7th  its me hit me back with a reply
fake gamers  oh you mean the chickens that wear boob shirts for tips on twitch .
the God of war games are not really good  the fact that you dont get a chance to do the puzzles without the game telling you how to solve it. terrible.  it looks good tho.
normies and posers always ruining the good stuff..........
games are basically movies now. so lame.
farcry 6 was woke garbage with stupid story   tras characters and bad gameplay
ubisoft games are now dull copy n paste every time. only games im looking forward too are  like a dragon  ishin!  hogwarts.. 2x copies plz    manor Lords  stalker 2 and kingdom come deliverance 2. not interested in anything woke  or limp wristed. iv cancelled disney  binned witcher off  thrown up on lotr  set fire fire to velma trailer and wiped my arse on willow. new dragon age is going to be a massive massive massive massive woke cess pit of woke shite you watch.
new God of war game are too woke and boring and kratos become too soft and female chracters soo ugly what happen to santa monica are they hate women soo much
cope.if you have to call yourself a  real gamer  and put down how other people prefer their games... youre not a real gamer. lol
yea God of war ragnarok was also garbage boring and who defends this game is willing to embrace everything because they have no standards anymore
