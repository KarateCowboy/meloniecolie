disney s steadfast dedication in its efforts to achieve absolute failure is almost admirable....
well  it has to  be updated for a modern audience  and  reflect the world we live in . you know  what you can expect from an animated movie set in mythological greece.
the phrase  inspired by tiktok  should never be a thing
I think writers take  write what you know  a little too literally nowadays. ernest hemingway knew about the spanish civil war because he was a medic in it and his stories in thatsetting have stood the test of time  if a writer immediately thinks of tiktok as inspiration  what does thatsay about that writer
how much do you want to be hated disney  yes
sounds like made for a  modern audience.  and we know what that means. so far the animated versions have been better imo. this movie sounds like its going to be a mess. oh you are so right  it does sound like they are threatened by content creators. you are making so many good point with this video.great video. and again congrats on 90k. you look gorgeous melonie. have fun today.
we should all agree that disney is a lost cause at this point.  aside from that  I hope you enjoyed your movie date with your father! keep up the good work mel.
inspired by tiktok  is another way of saying disney fired most of its writers.
whereas many of disney s recent live-action remakes have been faulted for sticking too closely to the source material words never before said by anyone. ever.
geesus. . . this just confirms disney is dead to me. I was really disliking a lot of their movie decisions but after she-hulk  insulting fans and viewers with out a care of what anyone thinks just made me give up and quit on them completely.  I dont see myself paying for anything disney related ever again. now inspired by tiktok  ya. . . Im truly done for sure.
Ive always liked the mystery of a  celebrity . now  I view them as they need to be relevant . I dont mind the youtube series into their life  but tiktok - I literally view tiktok as trash. I have younger siblings and believe it or not  thats where they get all of their news  and most of it it incorrect  information. I try my best to educate them and try my best to get them off it  but they re glued to it and say they re  busy
if you were going to make a live action hercules movie  why not do it with nuance and make the characters multI layered. show hercules to be a flawed hero  because in greek mythology they gave their heroes and God s very human qualities. show zeus and hades to be estranged brothers  each with their own justifiable issues  but ultimately finding a common ground. have hercules be the one who finally brings them together  this showing that despite our flaws and differences we have a common goal and can achieve it together. but that would make sense.
they re going to cast a tiktoker in the role  you ll see. if they re inspired by  what s gonna stop them casting one
disney   we re gonna remake cinderella but make her and the step sisters into guys. on the night of the party he is transformed into how he feels on the inside  a woman. let s call it cinderfella . like no thought process goes into these pitches and itscary how realistic that fake pitch I just made might be.
from zero to zero. I think this is a time james woods would actually turn down the role of hades if offered. and I think he s been the only guy who has voiced hades in all forms of media  I could be wrong .
couldn t have said it better myself melonie.your interpretation of hollywood actors not being normal people or knowing how the normal world functions is right on the money.
what passes me off is that even as a kid I wasn t a big disney fan but hercules and the lion king are 2 of my favorite animated films ever. my brother when I was 8 or 9 took me to see hercules and bcuz of that movie I fell in love with greek mythology
I cant even finish this video hercules is my very favorite movie  followed by snow white. disney just keeps ruining everything they built and breaking my heart
this channel and overLord dvd are the 2 best channels Ive found recently. love your takes  because you keep it real!
oh  disney lost their mind many years ago.  inspired by tiktok  may as well be  geared towards modern audiences
well I ll give them that at least thier commited to self destruction
so true
no. there s method in their madness. they are talking to their target audience  and by that Imean everyone because almost everyone  all ages  is on tiktok already.
@colin morgan  true
I will never understand their obsession with shooting themselves in the foot.
@thiago dias  they must think its fascinating to do...
mc will be black fmc will be   pick one
@shane douglas  its soo quirky ...
I laughed pretty hard at this. well done my friend
which part of the world do we live in  and if they want to be respectful  they re not   modern greece is still vastly white.
uh... greece has greeks  which are close to italians and not all of them are white. many are brown or olive skinned. also Ive seen known portaricans and african americans who appeared to look white  but weren t ethnically  so what s the problem  exactly
@marcus aurelius  my point was its ok to have white people in a film about greece. it doesnt have to be people of color specific like wakanda. asguard should be white specific however since its nors mythology and historically didn t have people of color  due to its harsh  cold  climate.
@nick  northern mediterranean peoples are generally classified as white regardless of how bronzed they are.
@ayaya farow  youre right. thats why itshouldn t be so bad if they are white  but they could be people of color and it would make sense. if changes make sense its fine. when they dont and just make one side happy and another side isolated and the story is sacrificed thats when changes are bad. hercules should be white  but can be a person of color. he just needs to retain core character elements  not be completely different  but use the hercules name. disney hollywood in general tend to not only change the race of a character  but their overall character traits  resulting in a brand new character with a familiar name for a cheap buck. this is just going to be another cash grab that dumps all over another legacy character. get woke go broke hollywood.
the movie already had modern jokes
as  catered for the modern audiences  shouldn t been a statement whatsoever.
tiktok should be banned.
tiktok is a psy-op
needs more pink sauce
@austin koeppen  someone tried to banned it. but voters preferred dementia  criminality  racial tensions and international disasters to mean tweet..
it is concentrated  hello  fellow youth .
@andrew s.  the guy who tried to ban it  was he the guy behind the platinum plan  I prefer keeping the first amendment  thank you very much. no more rinos.
@diogenes dworkinson  banning a platform owned by the chinese government is not a 1a violation
@austin koeppen  because americans should only be able to speak on platforms under the thumb of the us government and not where they choose  interesting logic  libbie...
this genocide of prominent tim tokkers was inspired by tik tok context matters  I d watch that.
inspired by facebook
the moment I saw those words I yelled two words to the skies   aw fuck
no  this phrase dont even exists
unless you are explaining toture tools.
never
its the worst combination of words Ive ever seen
@alejandro alvarez  honestly they shouldn t exist together
hercules with today s sensibilities wont be saving her because she dont need no strong man and he ll be dumb as a box of rocks so she can explain everything to him. the acting will be bad and not the original story. probably more of the same trash  we have been getting for years
exactly. the disney movies from the 90s that were successful were because someone that was involved with theatre decided that musical theatre and animation go well together. why cant they just do the same thing with this ! its times like this that I especially miss howard ashman and people like him.  riphowardashman
@heather verhagen  they dont have anything original anymore
unless its meant to be terrible. some april fools type movie
@austin mccormick8  unfortunately its probably nog
people dont know anything of value nowadays which is why most  entertainment  is so awful.
@joshua kolton  its hilarious  you look at these writers and yourealize they have had no life experiences whatsoever. taking inspiration from tiktok is like getting dinner from an outhouse.
@john smith  pretty much
Ive stood on the side of a rural chinese highway watching a car I just dove out of while moving as it burned down to the frame.played baseball in taiwan.hiked six 14k mountains in colorado.got lost in the swiss alps and had to eat random berries for a night hoping I didn t get sick.lived in three foreign counties.seen a person shot in front of me.mauled by a dog. twice.drove across country on the backroads. three times.drove through an active riot. by my grandfather. on purpose. to teach me the importance of taking education seriously.been thrown off an atv  snowmobile and a horse.saved a 3 year old from drowning.kicked a gator going after a dog.dodged being t-boned in my car by inches.yet Ive got nothing on hemingway and many other of the classic authors in life experience.
what does itsay  non-existent attention span  for one thing  I d imagine. blatant pandering and cringe is another thing to think of  maybe. blatant attempts at attention getting  for sure as well. in other words  it doesnt say much good about the writer in question at all.
that if you put your ear up to theirs  you can hear a dial tone
@john smith  for a moment there my sleep deprivation and hunger made understand outhouse as outback  the restaurant  and I was ready to go to war with you but luckily I looked twice. excellent comparison now that I can see it clearer.
@ltnetjak  tl dr
notice they cite the animated movie as their source  not the legends of hercules. same thing happened with rings of power -- the showrunners said they d be  true to the original movies . and the star wars garbage sequels -- they were based on the first six movies  rather than on the space opera and serials that inspired lucas.modern hollywood seems to have no background deeper than the latest movies. the writers dont seem to read anything but twitter.
write your own shit  its the only way
its going to lean heavily into lgbtq themes since ancient greece had a lot of it going on.
drinker just made a video talking about that
a lost cause  perhaps  but either way  like a bloated whale corpse  it ll be around a while yet still
ever notice how disney re-arranged is snidey   I just did  when reading your comment.  never realised that before.
just realized that  they have been a dead cause since star wars.
@lex ruptor  lol!
@lovise ricachii  haha truth
they fired all the good ones. they have plenty of hacks
@marco genovesi  pretty much
I think you have been watching too many anime. they are not going to put that kind of effort to it.
@raximus3000  I actually dont watch anime  but I do agree with you that they d never put in that kind of effort
it digusts me that I see tiktok ads in my city on digital billboards
except  cinderfella  is a 1960 jerry lewis movie...
I d watch that
he has  and I agree that he would likely turn this role down.
they were always glorified jesters. the reson is many people saw them and so they got rich.
the studios used to try to protect the actors from themselves by controlling their public images. the collapse of that has led to the garbage celebrities we have today.
thank you so much!
disparu  critical drinker  and nitpicking nerd major grin are better for analysis.
@bruce  yea... but doomcock
@bandofbrothers235  all hail doomcock!
nooooo! the last untouched movie from my childhood. Im truly saddened by this news  I never saw myself in this character physically. but his feets of bravery honesty and integrity are what inspired me to become a soldier.
we re really living in this remake era aren t we
hercules is probably my favorite movie of all time  I cant explain how mad I am that disney is about to destroy it.
this is going to hurt me so badly.  hercules was my favorite disney movie from the renaissance.  I loved the style or the art with the sharp angles and swirling details  and I loved the greek story  being half greek myself.
isn t this how they approached the new pinocchio live action film       that turned out fantastic!!!
the only thing I will say is that guy ritchie isn t very woke friendly in his films  he s very crass with his humor so Im actually excited about this. I love his recent work so hopefully it wont be too awful
8 35 this is a perfect example of how and why terrifier and terrifier 2 have higher ratings despite having quite literally 1  of the budget of most movies in the past 5 years. and yet  significantly better story  visuals  acting etc. down with the big studios
what works in animated cartoons does not necessarily work live.also  one of the most frightening english phrases is  this time its different.   also  going back more than a few years  the canadian comedy duo wayne   shuster had a half-hour spoof of the trojan horse.wayne  to shuster  who has just presented the idea of a wooden horse  a wooden horse   a wooden horse   just how is this different from your wooden donkey  your wooden cow  your wooden three-tier wedding cake ! !
when I heard this  all I could imagine was hercules going to fight a monster and then dropping into a tiktok dance.
its like disney saying we will remake atalantis and make it inspired by vaush and breadtube
new video!!! and melonie looks insanely cute today!
aside from just being a cringey concept in general  I really dont think it will work  trying to take a shortform of entertainment and translating it into longform. hell  I remember hearing not too long ago thatsome artist who got famous primarily through tiktok got his first live concert  and nobody in the audience knew his songs apart from the chorus.
I dunno how chapek thinks disney will survive the next 100 yrs when they keep churning out garbage like this. as always fantastic insights melonie.
yay!!! congrats on 90k melonie. you look beautiful
if disney s pulling inspiration from tiktok  then they ve lost all creative integrity
just brilliant!  I have never heard a more brilliant idea.  the whole live action movie will be hercules doing tiktok videos and uploading them to the internet.  brilliant!  not serious .
at this point  disney isn t even trying to pretend that these remakes are made for the lowest common denominator.
please dont do this to my boy herc. please...
the one thing I think they should do is more accurate to the actual source before the animated movie. like I d watch the live action little mermaid if it followed the book where the prince is cruel and makes her dance with bleeding legs and she turns to foam at the end. thats worth watching imo.
yeah im more entertained by you and jeramy from the quartering than any hollywood stuff. I would watch movies if they made anything worth watching but they dont.and by the way I do enjoy yours and jeremys content very much so thank you melonie.
one part I dislike about the original was the way itslandered men  especially from meg. if anything like that was said about a woman  then it would have been instantly cancelled
@raximus3000  rewatch the original disney version.
@jumpyman_thegamer  more like their entire 90s catalogue  it is good.

thatseems inevitable
 fast
I cant even get angry anymore  at this stage Im apathetic with disney and will just ignore what they do from now on.
I think they should do a live action hercules telling the story of the actual greek myths! so much there! from his birth as son of zeus   a human woman  resulting in hera s curse  through the labors of hercules   the resulting drama   humor. the king hiding when hercules completes one of the labors by bringing him cerberus  the guard dog of the underworld - comedy gold in the right hands. Im thinking of jeff goldblum as the king  now that could be fun.
instead of basing it on a book they re just using the characters and basing it on tik tok if you took the mental capacity of all the life forms running disney and converted it into energy you might be able to burn some toast.holy crap!
just as I predicted since 2020. once the superhero craze had been milk to death. the next venture is influencer inspired stuff.cant wait for hercules in a content hype house with hades and zeus. lmaobet hercules will be emasculated by the girl or he s into men.
I stopped paying attention to disney several years ago. best decision Ive ever made
once again  another childhood favorite about to be butchered.
hercules the legendary journeys starring kevin sorbo is the best live action hercules adaptation. modern hollywood will not be able to top that.
I guess it was fitting that I said to you the other day that I was getting meg vibes  and now this video.any who  have fun with your mom today.
Ive started playing a game called guess the complaint when a live action disney movie is announced I guess what these lunatics complaints will be. for hercules Im calling it now  its gonna be that he s only doing the hero thing to get a reward.
so in order to become a hero  hercules is going to have to do cringy tiktok dances and challenges.
hercules is one of my favorite animated movies.Imight just let cerberus consume me in the underworld. please disney  leave your classics alone.
inspired by tiktok  means it comes in 3 minute chunks  you have to buy a ticket for each one  and your popcorn and pop come in espresso glass sized cups. just so you get the  full movie experience  for each one.
a greek tale turned into a tiktok musical  we all know hercules will have a crush on hermes  or hephaistos  he will hate his dad and will convince hares to stop doing bad things by an open heart talk...
maybe rather than hitting hercules again for movie material  movie makers can harvest the other rich stories in greek mythology.I could enjoy the story of hades and persephone as a story  as long as hades is not just made a lustful villain . persephone and her mother demeter apparently used to be Goddesses of a cult around the underworld  they were so respected and feared during that era of ancient greece that their very names were cloaked in mystery. hades became king of the underworld much later and persephone and demeter got a facelift  even if persephone ended up returning to her role as queen of the underworld. written well  persephone could be given a lot of  agency . for example tired of always being around an overbearing mother  persephone is taken by the hades as much as he is with her. driven by a desire to get away from demeter and return to a long-forgotten past as a God of the underworld  she plots to get with hades  and to make itseem like his idea. simultaneously   and unbeknownst to persephone as she plans to seize her own happiness  hades is asking her father zeus for persephone s hand  which is immediately granted. persephone   rather proud of her clever plans go to win for herself the king of the underworld   allows herself to be  kidnapped  after having waited forever for hades to notice thatshe and the water nymphs pals are just hanging around. she is a bit embarrassed to find upon talking to hades that all her scheming was for nothing  zeus had granted permission for their marriage and it wasn t a true kidnapping. the couple laugh about it and settle into their new lives together.when demeter sulks about persephone s kidnapping  bringing about a perpetual winter  zeus tries to convince hades to return persephone to her mother. hades  dismayed  doesnt want to lose his wife. he loves her and feels like she s made the underworld feel more homey  he even feels like he s made some headway on convincing her to let him borrow one of the other multi-headed dogs so thatshe can have a multi-headed puppy like he has cerberus. persephone  for her part  panics. she likes being queen of the underworld. she has a husband who adores her  even if they will not be getting a puppy  and would do just about anything for her. returning to her controlling mother is unappealing. but people are dying from the constant winter caused by demeter s sulk and zeus is begging her to think of their worshippers. she is playing with a pomegranate as she agonizes about this. she suddenly freezes and hades  and her eyes meet. they both smile slowly. deliberately  she bites into the pomegranate  swallowing its seeds. she kisses hades goodbye  no puppy while Im gone.  as hades watches her go  he debates contacting echidna to at least open talks about obtaining one of the other multi-headed dogs to mate with cerberus. for later  like around persephone s birthday. once persephone actually holds a wriggling little multi-headed dog  she couldn t possibly resist falling in love and keeping him demeter  meanwhile  greets persephone with joy and spring comes to life around them. then demeter sees persephone s stained mouth and freezes.  oh   persephone says nonchalantly   do I have some on my face  its such a long trip from the underworld. dear hades and I just had to catch a quick snack together before I left. distraught  demeter begins to weep and a freezing rain begins to fall as persephone searches for something to wipe her face with. zeus comes down right away. the winter had gone away briefly  why was it back  did hades  oh  hI  persephone.zeus is grim when he hears that persephone ate food from the underworld. she has to return  once a person has partaken of the food of the underworld  they have to stay there. demeter wails and it begins to hail. panicked   even the head God of the greek pantheon is terrified when a Goddess cry s   zeus dispatches hermes to collect hades for a family meeting. after long and loud negotiations  zeus decides on a compromise where everyone gets a bit of what they want and where no one is happy about the solution. persephone will stay in the underworld ruling with hades for half the year  during which demeter will inevitably sulk  bringing about fall and winter. the other half of the year  persephone will spend with her mother   who is equally incapable of hiding her joy as she is her grief  ushering in spring and summer.the decision isn t ideal  but spending only half the year with demeter will probably actually help draw them closer  persephone consoles herself. she and hades embrace and she wistfully watches his lonely progress back to the underworld without her as winter once more melts into spring. end of credits scene  persephone returns to the underworld only to be knocked over by cerberus  who rubs his wet noses on her and gives her sloppy kisses any one if not all of his dog heads.  cerberus! off!  laughing  she pushes him off. its good to be home. she stands up and heads deeper into the underworld  cerberus trotting behind her.  hades  she glides past various prisoners like tantalus  ignoring them. she smiles when she almost reaches her and hades  thrown room and she hears his voice. she is almost in and opens her mouth to speak  when 3 high yips and barks reach her.her eyes widen.  hades! fade to black.
wish you had some content covering positive stuff. nothing these companies do anymore surprises me  its so tiresome.
I like how she paused at  reimagined   Ive only ever met 1 person who liked any of the remakes with it being the lion king. if you like them then please enjoy it. I just dont like how disney does rl adaptaions and see them putting their own feet in their mouth. great vid on bad bo
I think people are getting tired of what hollywood is offering us  but I would say they are getting tired of most forms of corporate entertainment in general  more so than just hollywood alone. I do agree with your sentiment  regardless
they ve made this movie.  its called hercules in new york.  and itstars an absolute gigachad real man called arnold schwarzenegger
disney bod   our stock price is still too high for us to grab up.  we need to cause it to free-fall.also bod   wont that really tick off shareholders also bod   after the fire sale  we will be the only shareholders.
Im surprised you didn t react to the part about  staying too close to the source material.
there was a tv series that was likely more faithful to the legends than disney will be.
@rob crawford  is that the one that was out around the same time as xena warrior princess  I didn t watch either   I dont remember when they came out  Imay have too young or not born yet   but they are iconic in those roles.I think that hercules plays in a lot of Christian movies now
I also did but after I heard of the stupid things they been doing I came back to see what s up
and they gonna make meg twerk like she hulk.
you know hercules gonna be some toxic male villain because God forbid that a straight  masculine male is a hero to  them. and of course meg is gonna be of course is gonna be some entitled misandrist lesbian mary sue.
@dlairdiablo  yeah  and I will say it again hades will be the obligatory  first gay disney character .
@yuri-sama   Im willing to bet they re going to make a megan thee stallion reference in the movie now  because they re just that pathetic.
thats he ll be welcomed home to the tik tok version of olympus...
cant wait for them to make nightmare fuel live action lilo and stitch!
you guys are the new superstars.
translation  disney still got money to burn in a dumpster fire.
nothing could make me avoid a film or show faster than mentioning the word tiktok or woke.
faulted for sticking too closely to the source material  said by absolutely no one.
considering there are some really good tiktoks. I guess I will wait till it comes out.
gee  I like the animated hercules. I think I ll give the tik tok inspired live action remake a pass and just watch the animated one again.
that  made in heaven  button is looking really tempting right now
one of the new jobs for hercules is gonna be him eating a meal with pink sauce and doing the devious lick.
I thought they learned their lesson from the live action mulan about taking the movie in a different direction
I cant really say much about disney doing remakes of there own movies  but what I can say is anytime  any body dose a remake its not the same  and is less enjoyable. I also agree most actors dont know how to act normal. Imean maybe kiana reves might be the only one in holly wood that can act normal  but I dont think most can.
if you want to watch a good reimagining of hercules just watch the rock s take on it. pretty good movie  fun to watch. follows the original relatively closely while adding the twist that hercules is just a conman taking advantage of the legends.not a spoiler  btw.
fingers crossed I have high hopes. they did infinity war  end game and extraction.
james woods was genius as hades. there s no way they could improve on it
not the one  disney movie I actually liked
hImelonie Im glad for u spending sometime seeing a movie with your dad.Im not so surprised know hearing all these ideas are really bad.
oh man  I can only imagine the reaction on this former  buddy  of mine s face when she watches the film. she once boldly stated that hercules is her favorite disney film ever  and she was also a self-proclaimed  raging leftist  and openly admitted to being woke  so yeah... if we were still talking  which we thankfully aren t  Im certain she d defend this live-action film regardless of how bad its very likely to be. haha
Im lost.   in what parallel messed up universe is  inspired by tiktok  a thing
canthey have it be more experimental  by experimenting with the idea that it accurately follows the story of heracles
I hope they do even more  I want them to lose lots and lots of money.
no dont do it!
the lou ferrigno 1984  hercules  is so over the top itshould be a cult classic.
I thought it was alright hollywood pulled a double and made 2 hercules movies at the same time. I think I liked the legend of hercules a bit more. I just checked the ratings and feel a bit off. the rock one has a 6 10 while this one has a 4.2 10. I remember liking it is all Im saying. it also had the guy who took up the role of spartacus after andy died. it has no lore whatsoever though I believe.
@themichaelmyth  take a look at the classics.  steve reeves was hercules.  1950 s sword and sandal classics.  defined the genre and inspired the modern body building craze of the 80 s and 90 s.
to be honest  I d rather just any other studio make that more accurate movie  because you know they d barely research into it and half do it
because I love that idea too much to let disney say they ll do it  similar to mulan  and not try at all
we dont need a live action hercules  just stream hercules  the legendary journeys with kevin sorbo.
a live action hercules from disney will be a glorious dumpster fire hercules doesnt need to be rebooted
omg I am already picturing hercules doing tiktok shorts and weird cringe dance clips
hercules is my favorite animated disney movie.I think the russo bros might be able to do something here but I think its more likely to be cringe
experimental in tone  means they ran out of ideas and decided to roll the dice and let tik tok do the work that their writing team should ve done.
hercules might be my favorite disney animated movie. its like disney is really eager to rape and desecrate my childhood that badly.
still missing the verse of the day  mel.
it means that its time for disney to ruin my favorite disney movie
keep it up disney. keep on showing just how out of touch you are with all of the audience
melonie mac is like pokimane if pokimane actually reacted to media news or reacted to anything in general or even talk about conversations that even make sense
if I paid attention to what others were thinking the heart inside me would ve died  but I was just too stubborn to ever be governed by enforced insanity  bob dylan  up to me ..still my favorite line https   youtu.be dqq7f67syi0
noooo I will not let them ruin megara.
I love guy ritchie movies because they were colorful action and crime films he is above making a hercules film
hollywood is a blackhole of creativity!!!!  o
tiktok did not exist in ancient greece
should have kevin sorbo as zeus would be a great cookie and he would look the part.
instead of remakes  if they really want to rely on existing ip and do the live action thing  I think they would be better off doing gritty live action sequels for an older audience.  as a kid you get a fun cartoon and then grow up and watch a more mature film but with familiar characters
hey melonie I just wanted to tell you that I think that they made it for young older adults growing ups like you and me and everyone else who is young mature young adults and not for young kids and small kids bc they are trying to make it to be so real that young small kids wont understand what it is about and young small kids will be asking their parents about what the movie is about and why they put it on tiktok website for us older young adults to watch and understand what they are talking about and what its really about  ok melonie. anyway thats what I wanted to say bout this video topic of the video and I just wanted to tell you that to have a wonderful and great blessed day today with your mother for girls day out and hope you have a wonderful and great blessed day and evening with your parents and have a wonderful and great blessed weekend too melonie.
so they are going to take a timeless story and make it instantly outdated as soon as it releases. how do you even do that
I just realized the tattoo above your elbow says gojira and yes.
or like if pokemaine were pretty..
especially with hercules  Imean if they want to make a version close to the actual myth it would be shocking enough  you know herc having an harem after killing a lion  killing his kids with megara after an hera induced rage  doing the 12 jobs  fucking his nephew  having 2 wives after that  dying via poisoned cloth and becoming a God  having a 3rd  4th    marriage with the daughter of hera and zeus  his half sister
at least hercules is more ripe for live adaptation due to the legend and all. while I have no faith in it  there s at least potential for it to be somewhat original
didn t they already do a live action remake with the rock years ago
anything to do with tiktok is a huge burning red flag.
you know youre on a sinking ship when your target audience is narrowed down to impressionable woke teens on tiktok.  good luck taking their lunch money  disney.
did you here about the new casting of the live-action hercules
anyone who pays disney money for anything should really have a good think about what type of people they are supporting.
the only thing that could save this is if kevin sorbo reprised the role. otherwise its a hard pass for me lol
hollywood still busy convincing me to not watch anything they produce
well naturally  because when people mention hercules and ancient greece the first thing that comes to everyone s mind is tiktok.
inspired by tiktok better mean casting ideas like danny devito as phil
Im convinced disney is being propped up with money from the anitChrist. that is the only explanation for their actions. warner brothers is trying to course-correct. why disney thinks their audience will give in before they run out of money is anyone s guess.
give disney an f for respecting the greeks and hercules
the only tiktok I want to see them emulate is that one lady that eats butter...what was her name again
holding too closely to the source material  they gave mulan superpowers  took out main characters  and got rid of the music. they changed ariel s race  getting rid of the prince  and changing the whole story. they are getting in trouble for not holding close enough  and ruining the stories.
sticking to close to the source material  when did that happen
looking boom  she-dunk!hope you say modern audience
you look really great in your white shirt. holy crap.
hercules is going to have hippocrates doing covid dances calling it now
anything thats says its  made for modern audiences  or  a reflection of the world we live in today  have a track record for being horrific especially when its a remake  adaption or anything banking off a more successful legacy movie  show or book series
I d say let  em do it. they ll smite themselves

that was back in 2014  and there were actually two different hercules movies that year...both of them bad. considering this is greek mythology  you cant really call them remakes. each one is a different adaptation. its just sad that the ones from italy are more entertaining  for films anyway  tv is another story .
I think a live action adaption has incredible cultural potential but it would have to take itself seriously. not like zach snyder  seriously  in a dark way  but to actually tell an inspiring and heroic story for young boys. but disney cant aim at inspiring young boys toward heroic masculinity. their not just out of practice  its now against their ideology. the animation pulled off musical and comedic elements  but that would just translate as campy. add tiktok to itsomehow and we re approaching toxic levels of camp. it could be good  it wont tho.
they have not been faulted for sticking too close to the source material or to the original animated film. they were  faulted for deviating in places where deviating was not required.
I hope this inspiration from tiktok means the department of justice takes down disney... wishful thinking  I know... rip z-lib
hercules is one of the oldest characters in western culture. they cant possibly do him justice and stay true to modern hollywood politics.
disney is destroying our history of what was good bad
it would be great if you would make a version that would stick to the myths. hades is not evil and not the antagonist. I really hate that hades is always portrayed as the evil one  this has nothing to do with the myths. hercule s opponent is hera. but we all know how likely this is.
mickey mouse should no longer be disney s mascot. goofy now needs to be the mascot
whole concept giving off big  hey there fellow kids  energy.
takes out woke bing I call that hercules will remain to be superficial and somehow the bad guy
pat mc namara or grizzly for hercules if its social media inspired
agbo - attorney general of body odor. also  I predict that this remake will introduce the world to an entirely new level of suck.
sticking too close to the original animated films  I wasn t aware mulan was so much like the original film. if only they took a few drastic steps away from the original  it would have been praised. oh  wait...
what tangent    lolfirst thing I saw about this was herc his  horse  and the word experimentation.   well  in  today s disney .... that made me nervous.    pIm not sure how many tax write-offs disney needs  they seem to be overdoing it lately.    one major  multi-million dollar flop after another.
cant wait to watch a greek hero inspired by a chinese app.
many street walkers have taken inspiration from tiktok and raised their prices.
the word salad headlines that these marketing bottom feeders conjure reduces my braincell count
art is just an algorithm to these people.
what next lilo and stitch live action remake inspired by instagram
how do y all feel about elon musk making twitter used who have blue ticks to pay a monthly subscriptions  I d personally copy and paste the icon in my bio - there Im verified haha
is this going to be a dragonball evolution situation
well there goes another animated movie I loved as a kid being ruined. this movie and God of war made me fall in love with greek mythology. hades is still my favourite disney villain ever. this is just depressing that the so called family company is so hell bent on destroying the child hood memories of millennials.
hey russos  do be sure to race swap hercules. thanks  lol!
we have couple dozen live action movies and a tv show that lasted seven seasons
they re the guys that made captain america winter solider  civil war  infinity war  and endgame. winter solider is one of my favourite mcu movies - so far I wrote a paper on when I was in university
so get this. I commented on this topic on instagram and all I said was   dumb already.  and they said my comment may be toxic or racist and that if I choose to post my comment anyway they could suspend me.honestly if instagram cant handle a comment about this particular topic being dumb  and trust me it is  they really wont be able to handle my review of it. if my instagram did get shut down I ll just do a youtube review  most likely  just blasting disney and tiktok for making garbage  yet again  and than I ll mock instagram for being whittle babies!
its weird that the russo brothers are doing this. given the whole marvel thing  except for captain marvel  leading up to and including endgame was theirs.
bet they ll make him some deluded narcissistic fool and make megata the hero  or worse  make her a mary sue and mess up the original idea thatshe was playing him because hades. as a kingdom hearts fan  if they ruin herc  I ll be pissed...
ooooh boy... I cant wait to watch the dumpster this live action will be without actually watching it
if they re actually gonna do this  at least give the people a muscular man that looks close enough to portray him  not some toothpick tiktok zoomer.
disney producers 2022  I was scooping my dog s business yesterday and I was hit with inspiration for no less than 8 remakes and 7 tv shows.
the people running disney today are pure ideological maniacs  investors should drop thatstock like a hot potato.
makes you wonder  is the whole  representation  push a misinterpretation that people watch youtube channels etc that look like them whilst ignoring that we tend to watch things we can relate to on some level. eg I ll watch people who enjoy good stories  or people who make compelling arguments  or present current events. the person on the screen doesnt have to resemble me  they just have to be stable in terms of their own brand  eg quentin tarantino makes fun over the top films  thats his brand
short answer  yes  yes they ve lost it.
hercules isn t even a disney property  its a 2000 year old story  like most of their most popular films are just adaptations of public domain stories.there s plenty of old stories that you can still mess up for free  disney.
inspired by tik tok really isn t the selling point they think it is.
4 things that my autistic brain cant comprehend   modern disney  making a  live-action hercules  by using  tiktok  as their  inspiration . in the wise words from a successful black man always said  dead on arrival . lastly  why not a  spin-off  of hercules to explore on hades   meg s chemistry  they briefly explained they had history from the animated hercules movie which would be interesting .
I dont think disney marvel purposely made she-hulk bad. disney marvel spent what ...  75m on 3 episodes  thats a lot of money to just throw away for any company. I dont believe it at all.
theyll be doing dances while reading your angel numbers and playing that guitar riff that isnt real
it probably wont be good  but at least they re doing something new with it  instead of just making the same thing as the animated film just worse like the others have been. makes its existence a little more justifiable.
based off of tiktok eh ! they might as well change the title from hercules to cringules!
but seriously  if they re so concerned about representation  why dont they research african mythology and tell a story most americans haven t heard before  that would actually be cool.
russo brothers have done some good work for disney in the past  but I dont think this is going to land the way they want.also   live action  hercules is just hercules. trying to make cartoon hercules in the uncanny valley is a misstep.
I read the headline and wanted to rip my eyes out
so  let me get this straight  a grown woman who yammers about video games and comic book movies 24 7  surrounded by stuffed animals and action figures  thinks something like this is ridiculous. okay.
these companies just never learn
another frustrating thing about the disney company these days is when a show like the owl house is successful  it gets cancelled. this is a show that has elements such as representation  but the story and characters take priority and thus it has been generally beloved  much like arcane which had those elements but still focussed on a good story and characters . however  it was cancelled as if they were in favor of trying and failing miserably at other projects like star wars and marvel. they had a golden goose with owl house  but they only wanted it on their terms  which are pretty garbage. vote with your money  dont go see these movies. these hacks need to be cycled out.
the original hercules myth is a sort of cautionary tale for men  as hercules suffered greatly as a result of his impulsive violence   lack of self control.they could make a film about  dare I say it  toxic mascinity  that might even be good  but a tiktok influencer hero musical  no thanks.
what is the expectation of a tiktok audience from a musical  to not last more than a few minutes  thats what they expect. jeezus on a pogo stick  the balls these hacks have to try to  cater to newer audiences  without understanding that the newer audiences dont want movies alltogether
it means that hercules is going to be a weak  indecisive simp who needs to be rescued by the strong female replacement character.
inspired by tiktok  so they ll aggressively spy on every singe person that goes to the theater to see this abomination.
dont worry about hercules being a white lead  hercules has red hair so by the rules of wokism he wont be allowed to be played by a white actor
if they race change any of the main charcaters in this live action remake  I bet the people of greece will go crazy. I would be extremely disrespectful for them to race swap legendary  figures in greek culture. but I wouldn t be surpised if they do. its either that or they will make herclues a simp beta bitch.
if they make him like those creeps on tiktoks that preys on kids hell no
unless james woods is hades  its going to suck. granted it will probably suck anyway but at least with him it will be entertaining.
disney is the fast food of movie studios now. they just pump out garbage after garbage and hoping something sticks to the wall. tiktok is the worst place to draw inspiration.
saying that the live-action remake disney films failed  because they stayed too close to the originals  is pretty laughable when you actually look at how far away these live-action films are from the originals in many ways. in terms of quality  writing  etc. these films are pretty much just live-action bootlegs to the originals. and the fact that their latest one is going to be inspired by a tiktok  yeah this film is doomed to do a nose dive into the underworld s rivers but someone somehow drained the river dry. there is no chance in hell that this new film is going to even get close to breaking even.great video  keep up the great work.
Imean greeks aren t always white  less so then  usually pretty tanned due to the climate especially in the times of ancient greece before people spread through other cultures  I agree  a new animated show movie would be tolerable  a remake would be dumb
think they ll bring back james woods
disney is fully committed to digging its own grave.
its going to look like highschool musical meets greek mythology
technicaly it already was. greek mythology is too hardcore for a family movie.
Ive come to believe live-action adaptations of animated properties are almost always a bad idea  cough  cowboy bebop  cough . animation or graphic illustration adds an element of fantasy and distance that live-action lacks. superman is just some clown in blue tights  red underpants worn outside  and a freakin  cape. as live-action its just silly. as animation or comic  he s one of the most enduring  universally recognized superheroes ever.the stories that endure are the timeless ones. in contrast  imagine a movie made about key people on myspace. thats what this will be in a decade or so. another forgotten attempt to capture the interest of a culture they are apparently utterly clueless about. I used to have a lot of regard for disney  but they ve sunk to being just another corporation run by morons and stockholders. no disney  for me!
for someone so young you are certainly one of the most cynical people I have ever seen on youtube  melonie.  I like your enthusiasm  though.  so tell me  just what exactly is it that you would want hollywood to do with regard to their content   you seem to have an idea of what you want to see.  you should check out the following movies   victor victoria.  myra breckenridge.  the valley of the dolls and beyond the valley of the dolls.
I suspect its gonna be a shitshow knowing they are inspired by tiktok instead of greek mythology.
I love lots of guy ritchie films but this is one Im not looking forward to. member revolver  lock  stock and two smoking barrels  member snatch  member layer cake
yep disney is def giving all their success n red carpet to warner bros lol
Ive long considered disney a lost cause. I saw the writing on the wall with the first live-action remakes. why does something timeless need a remake  as for tiktok  I wont even entertain an opinion thatsays its anything other than trash. I know opinions are subjective and everyone has the right to do what they want to do. but tiktok is filled with nothing but people desperate for attention  challenges that can be a real danger to people s lives and society  and has also shortened the attention span of the average person even lower than it was. it has done nothing but harm. you couldn t convince me tiktok has done a single beneficial thing for society or humanity at large.
inspired by tiktok   like   a full feature length movie for 60 second attention spans now
dude.. wtf is disney doing  like seriously
I think its more because they re creatively bankrupt. they have no new ideas and their stagnation is killing them. thats why they are seeking out creators and stealing their ideas. buying them out essentially.
I better see nikocado avocado as phil
seriously!  disney has lost it  they ll be their own ruin.
as I haven been saying since star wars.... disney can go bankrupt for all I care. now Im just seeing how low canthey go
inspired by tiktok  so does this mean it will be a 22 second short film with crap choreography and boobs
disney lost their minds a while ago.... did you see the star wars movies  I saw 2...and have they actually seen tik tok  that is not something you want.......
so if they re taking inspired from tik tok  does that mean the whole  movie  would be a 1 minute long  lol
let disney go broke while saving money and laugh at them for free.
its for  modern audiences  though mel lol...
well  let s hope its only 60 seconds long.
I love you sis  but their family name is pronounced  ru so  their two brothers who make movies some of which most people have seen
nice one melonie.
it will be released in 100 weekly installments on the starbucks website
all I can say is vote with your wallet.
if kevin sorbo isn t hercules in this it wont be worth making.
inspired by tiktok  oh so does that mean I ll lose brain cells watching it and it will cause psychological problems
these guys are the same people who made the avengers movies
criticised for sticking to source material show me the receipts  when do hollywood ever stick to the plot without just rewriting everything
hey melonie and your cool dogs  so disney inspired by tiktok its going to be hilarious  or too weird.
there is only one live action hercules and his name is kevin sorbo.
disney s creativity is gone
elon musk is going to buy disney next.
Im terrified  and halloween is over and exam time hasn t started yet
disney is really desperate.
tiktok is an influence for a multimillion dollar disney movie. this is truly the end of hollywood.
no  dont you dare touch hunkules!!!!
influenced by tiktok  so its going to have a runtime of less than 2 minutes
I ll just do what I did when the lebron james space jam came out. I watched the michael jordan space jam instead to try and mess up hbo max s metrics.
I was going to say  let dwayne johnson play hercules!  then I remembered he already has  and that version was not good.
Im also inspired by tiktok  going to keep on scrolling.
that must be an april fools joke.
disney going down so fast they re gonna wake up a balrog
as far as the russo company goes  how about agrossbodyodorkeeping itsimple.
live-action abominations
im assuming inspired by tik tok means the chinese government is calling the shots
its going to be a series of 5 to 15 second long clips specifically designed by a gambling addiction expert
this sounds like the actual worst idea ever...they really gonna ruin every property they made great originally  this is one of my favourites too...fk disney  they need to fire everyone. who put crack in the russo s coffee  wtf has  happened to them
they will go that way shill will go the distance cut thy slong renamed hera son
.... faulted  for sticking too closely to the source material.....   thatsays it all right there.  they have zero clue what the audience wants  its just what they want.
in hercules leans into meta humor period  then they will fail. and they will...
they already lost their minds long ago.
2 19 that doesnt sound like disney
the only thing I want to see in the future referring to based on the tiktok story is a film about Lord musk putting these people to the wall
I agree that this live action stuff is crap and that it wont go well like the rest of them but the thing Im curious about is why you say russo the way that you do lol . I dont think Ive ever heard it pronounced like that
inspired by tiktok means it ll have loads of woke crap. so hercules will be gay  and black with two moms  and zeus will be the  evil  dad because he lost his wife to another woman and doesnt like that his son is gay  so this means he ll be not only evil  but dumb as well.
Im already predicting annoying over used tiktok and fan fiction from this...
that means they found a new way to ruin movies and properties  congratulations disney
cant wait to see herc chug a tide pod and then douse himself with ice water before banging a centaur. -  herc  herc! its helena! helena! she s twerking! twerking!
...experimental...   is that the new buzz word in hollywood for cr p
disney proving again that they make nothing new.
this is where you say disney has gone insane its not how they desecrated marvel and lucas arts
the next movie is gonna be cinderella inspired by tumblr
ridlle me this if disney did acually achive diffrent rsult for once  in form of commercialisation of chanise crimes aganist humanity apart from making a real bad film  canthey still be defined as insane
where is the mods when you need em
arnold will gonna time travel lol
and herk is a red head
hercules gonna like dudes
youreally have to be at a low point to remake a classic film and have tik tok as inspiration
hollywood magic
since when has anything good been created within tiktok thats isnt disturbing.
there s only so much money disney can flush down the toilet before they start to run into financial trouble. I wonder how much longer they can continue on their current trajectory before something gives.
getting a million followers on tiktok is going to be one of the 12 labours.also stop  fixing  things that isn t broken.
itsounds like its going to be boring. Im glad Im not a child in this day and age. I think I would be super depressed.
parents protect your children
tiktok already a red flag
from hero to zero
inspired by tiktok  more like doa.
disney   we re gonna remake 101 dalmatians  but make it about the consequences of outlawing abortion
disney hasn t gotten anything right since the 2000s
if every disney movie was based on tinder and tiktok every male character would be a 10 and every female character would be a sub 5 with mental disorders or obesity issues and a bad attitude . ps  I dont use online dating apps as you can guess
10 07 will smith has entered the chat
disney s hercules is a redhead. thats enough to know what they ll do to him.
sounds more like  twerkules  lol
the only live action movies that need to be adapted from animation or anything like that is either treasure planet or the iron giant if youre not bringing me either one of those dont even sit at the f     negotiating table
ok well I will not be watching the live action and probably not be able to watch the original anymore
inspired by tiktok  oooh so the whole cast will be chinese lol
criticized for staying too close to the source material  really  did that happen
this could be the epitome of making something dumbed-down for dumb-people s sake.
creative bankruptcy  says it alldrops mic
for what I am hearing... this is going to be a dragon ball evolution all over again. source material fuck it this is a school drama with some action in between thats what works righ  right !
alright guys Im going to one up disney. Im remaking the emperor s new groove and its inspired by 4chan
when has a live action disney remake ever been successful  why keeping making them ...take the hint disney
live action movies based off of disney s classic animation  their record is the worst.
not another one..... when will they learn!
its pronounced  rue-so   not  russ-so.
a musical  inspired by tiktok!   what would that look like 20 second swatches of song and dance   white man bad  eat the rich!  preformed in greek.
God help us all
at this rate disney marvel will be bankrupt in a few years  if not less.
disney went downhill in the 2000s with the teen shows the older cartoons.were better when it was walt disney
cool
no  it means hercules will be a short  thin  black woman who identifies as  zir  zim  and as a poly-animal.
no no no no no no. Im 30 years old!! Ive never tik tok d in my life. am I really too old to be marketed to   a lifelong hardcore comic fan this is such a bad idea I cant watch this video anymore. sorry ms mac. your the best
it only makes sense where live action would add spectacle  but cgI has effectively killed movie magic  oh another fake explosion  oh another green screen
stopthegreekhate
and with that megara will be a man-hater.  and hades will be the next obligatory  first gay disney character .
oh God no.   wait they stuck to the source material    mulan was so far from the source it could have been called something else and it would have made it a better movie
Im sure hercules will be an east-asian woman.
cant wait to see pegasus as a gay unicorn
are we all ready for black hercules and lesbian megara
unless they set it in modern day...
so instead of being greek hercules will be black  donning a rainbow flag toga  have pink and blue mullet hair  a doorknocker nose ring  and a blm face tat  all while dancing to the most annoying sounds people consider music
they finally decided to get creative with a remake  and its a horrible  horrible idea.
what the hell  is hercules gonna behead the hydra and take a selfie   and who tf complained the live action movies were too close to the source!  Im pretty sure we hated mulan because it didn t follow the source material... what the fuck
agree
go boom.
disney is boken.
what does this even mean   will it only be 15 seconds long
do you all remember the last annoying bad hercules live action movie with dwayne rock johnson  me neither!
peakweimar
I refuse these grown human beings has brain cells
twerkules
where do I sign up to not watch this
disney doesnt know how to create.  only destroy.
they do live action movies because they ran out of story ideas a long time ago.
let s experiment with....... pick a subject  and change everything. how does that work out every time
oh my loooooooooool!!!!!!!!
@melonie mac go boom
only disney can find a formula that cant be touched by anyone and then absolutly destroy it. they need to stop messing up thier classics.
inauthenticity always fails in the end... at least that will be entertaining to watch.
if its going to be 4th wall breaking .. well  I wasn t going to watch it anyway.
go home  disney  youre drunk.
hercules will be a trans-gender poly sexual half hispanic  half jamaican star
inspired by tiktok  count me out. out.
criticised for being too close to the source material uhh... what  disney  pretty sure its been the opposite for over a decade.
I predict a light skinned black actor as hercules and everyone else  middle eastern  asian and spanish decent.
obviously the main character will identify as a woman. it is in the name after all  hercules.
a reimagination of a  reimagination. what s the point  many people  if not everyone  know hercules outside of disney.
I am done with disney. I ended my subscription and told them where to go. doe paying for garbage.
this  for modern audiences  thing needs to stop  modern audiences are influenced by shit like tiktok  why are we catering for that in things that last longer than 10 seconds
already sounds awful  and I doubt it ll have james woods seeing as he s apparently been blacklisted by hollywood. a great actor like him blacklisted is honestly a crime...I hope this reverse-mccarthyism in hollywood ends soon.
why on earth should they make a movie about ancient times with modern technology ! Imean  thats not what works in hercules! not to mention its going to put in social media  by force! you dont need to put in something that reflects to today! at least it ll be different to the original film  but I still dont like the idea of it referencing modern technology  in a story all about hercules  set in the ancient times!
follow to close to source material wtf
love you
@meloniemacgoboom
I dont get itso instead of the black soul singer women it will be a public relations team or something   lol
so the she-hulk creators created a terrible show on purpose to own the critics  and then promptly get owned by the critics because the show is bad.  lmao
we all know hercules is going to be gay and black or a black female lesbian bI and gender fluid
that might happen lol
mel mel! disney is one of those companies that thought  hey! we are for the fans!  but they chose the wrong  fans  to listen to. I dont think a musical is bad but its the same shit where someone in production is just okaying things because they may lose there job. the worst thing is the people in the company who want to go against them know that if they re fired  they will be replaced with a tri-color haired wierdo. honestly anything disney says they are doing I cant help but hear these words now brave    stunning    updated for a modern audience . like stop doing this dumb shat disneyyyyyyy.
they re going back to all the cartoon movies where the straight white guy gets the girl and changing the story for the live adaptation to where he doesnt. Imean this with no disrespect towards people who aren t straight white males btw. look at these upcoming little mermaid and snow white movies already putting that fact upfront to the press. wait for it  this is what they re doing here again
I dont see the problem  it is just  updated for modern audiences .how do I get off this planet
dear God please dont let them. hercules nemo and beauty and the beast were my favorite  they already ruined beauty and the beast
greece is going to be even madder.
hercules will be a bumbling idiot and megara will have to cut her hair  put on some pants and fight hades to save hercules.
well .... hello there.
I think what it means is disney really likes the ccp.
wokecules
megara is the hottest disney princes  change my mind.but Im sure they will make her transgenderd or a bbw for inclusive reasons.

why do u think disney is failing !   they re failing in entertainment but in their eyes they re winning. they love to hate the fanbase.
twercules
so meg is going to complain about men.
inspired by tik tok  so it ll be filled with porn  anti-white racism  screaming fake guiraists  and bad sound mixing we got a hit folks!
hercules will be black.Im calling it now.
inspired by tik tok  disney has truly given up on originality...
ugh  live action remakes need to stop. I like the idea  but disney ruins everything.
audiences have been trained by tiktok   what  just make a magical good story. stop modernising!!
as some with greek heritage let me just say  they will butcher the story.
inspired by tiktok  a.k.a if you watch it you ll be less intelligent than you were before.
Im sick of these people. if you think youre going to improve upon a story that has literally stood the test of time by surviving thousands of years via word of mouth  you need your ego checked. hard.
mulan  the animated movie was great. the live-action which was a complete 180 from the source sucked!
its just the easiest and legal way to steal people s ideas and use it as their own.
inspired by tiktok  ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooohhhhhhhhhhh boy
it means the characters will all be intellectually stunted weaklings with self-diagnosed psychiatric disorders.
pleeeeeeaaaaaaase! make itstooooop!!  no more!!
the original hercules wasn t even that good. hades was the best part of the original. also cant wait for  latinx  hercules or whatever bs they do for  diversity and inclusion . at this point  Im just hoping more people see the trash being fed to them and disney just outright dies as a company.
agbo   ass gas body odor
inspired by tik tok  thatsounds absolutely horrid.
disney is super cringe and all  but how much you bench bro
gen z doesnt go to movies so they are attempting to market to them and it will fail
so hercules is a black dude who watches videos on his smartphone
anthony s gay body odor
nobody asked for it   you obviously aren t on disneys board.by the way is there anyone out there that can pull off what walter white did in a jail in 180 seconds in that boardroom   just kidding. obviously I agree with you that no customer is asking for this and itsounds like an abomination
roo-so
hades is gonna be a flamboyant gay man  isn t he
so... they want to make a movie for a modern audience  but are too scared to use original characters and a more original story. instead they re piggy-backing on established characters based on another nation s mythology  but inject their own ideology.  is this how you avoid plagiarising your own studio s work
the russo brothers really lost it after completely annihilating  steve roger s character in endgame. they re complete woke incels with no care for source material.
didn t disney fire a bunch of the progressive writers because they weren t making enough money  guess they didn t get all of them.
baaah
russ-o  did u even marvel
inspired by tik tok    terrible camera work
paying disney for their new shit is embarrassing.
ancient guys body odor
this is yet another  hello fellow kids  bs move. its going to be inspired by  whatever is the kids watch   what is that  dunno
agbo   anime girl body odor
disney movies are pretty much dead to me now. I cant anymore with disney. marvel movies were the only thing holding me to them and now even thats starting to wane.  all of hollywood today...  except tom cruise - top gun maverick  are garbage.
russo  rooso
what s the point of remaking a movie or video game if your just gonna make fun and drive old fans away thats loves the original oh wait they want to update them for modern audiences well when these people do that and want to add their own political views and race swap some characters not only they changed the nature of the show or movie you ve also ruined the fans fundamentally on how they view the characters and show.
Jesus loves you so love him
what the hell...
I have never been on tiktok and am proud of it
analytics
hercules is going to be a shitstorm.ain t no doubt.
if people wanted a real life movie about animals or historical mystical people  then they would have a better experience from a different company.... people liked disney for family and toons type movies not woke crap. just have hercules be a trans women  the horse be a oddball over the top black guy  the love connection can be a trans man
its stupid to make a live action remake at all. make something new  which disney is doing anyway. why cram the market with product just for the sake of it  pinocchio was a bomb. the lady and the tramp disappeared. so what s the point
2 46 greeks aren t white
nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
- disney ceo bob chapek    we  disney  aren t woke. - us   rolls eyes
when will disney learn that this is all just a huge waste of money and crappy content
rofl!
bro  if  experimental  means something like what the rock did when he played hercules  then Im already out. he basically just copy pasted his performance from that movie into black adam  only more emo ngl
please stop. some of us like animation and comics and anime. we dont need or want every single cartoon and comic as a live action. they have been trying for decades now and failing badly. please  just leave our animation alone. can someone convince disney thatsomething else makes money so everyone can jump on that bandwagon and go and ruin someone elses hobby for a while.
oh boy another lamb to the slaughter of adapting a classic story to  modern audiences .
it means its gonna be trash
Im calling it  all black cast.
....ok  I got it.okokokok I do !not wanna pay 25 million to a guy. we can not ownwe pay  this kid....2 ...3million. give em  a pizza party....medal !....I just saved the company....34.....39 million ! eh  what is the commission on 39000000000  oh  5 million  oops....vay.....cay.....
yes the animated originals are superior  the remakes dont even compare they truly are the lesser versions they have worse music  they tend to make the characters worst versions of themselves and sometimes  they re just mary sue s like mulan  the acting is forgettable or downright bad not to mention the feminist propaganda thatseems to be in all or most of these disney princess remakes.
so you wanna be hero kid
kid  you dont know
is meg gonna be a biological male  disney has lost their minds and can no longer make anything worth watching.
you are being either na ve or overly optimistic to believe disney will keep hercules as a white male lead.
the only reason to remake a perfectly good movie  is to inject it with a woke agenda...especially prequels.
more experimental  aka more lgbt propaganda being crammed in  I imagine  the original version of this is considered classic 90 s disney for a reason. why mess with the...oh  wait. muh lgbt muh diversity. never mind.
why am I not surprised they re doing a live action hercules remake  will hercules be a black  trans  autistic  nonbinary  gay  muslim I wonder if kevin sorbo or arnold schwartzenegger will make an appearance.
so it will flop alright thanks.
