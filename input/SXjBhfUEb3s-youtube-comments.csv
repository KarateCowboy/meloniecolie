soooo excited for the rippaverse. first comic books Ive ever bought.
I love how positive this community is
it wasn t just the woke stories but the quality of the art in a lot of mainstream comics that caused me to stop buying them. Im impressed by the quality of the art that Im seeing here. I hope the stories are just as good.as far as  the message  goes  there s nothing more toxic. if you accept yourself as a victim  it just creates hatred for yourself and everyone else around you.
melonie  as an atheist  I cantell you that your verse of the day segments have not nor will not deter me from following your content. its a part of who you are  and you shouldn t make compromises about stuff like that.
melonie  continue being proud of your faith. the verse of the day is at the end of your video  so people are free to click away without missing the main content  but by continuing to include the verse you may be giving someone exactly what the needed to hear. you never know.
great comments. Im a black man who had been a marvel and dc comic book fan since the 70s. I stopped reading comics and watching superhero movies over the last five years when wokeism took over those companies. I am so glad for the rippaverse. I have already bought the first edition and cant wait for more. long live the rippaverse.
holy balls rippa is starting his own comic brand  new billionaire coming through in a decade.
Im agnostic myself but having a character that follows a faith can be used very well in a story. first one that comes to mind is netflix s daredevil being very catholic. the struggles that brought to the character made for very engaging viewing
my favourite part about this whole comic was the reaction of the twitter crowd.Ive never seen so many people with blm in their bio call a black man the n word
honestly this really makes me want to get into writing. instead of complaining about the trash thats been released make something that is actually good. the future is looking just a little brighter
I love comics  which is why I haven t bought any for years.  rippaverse is changing that for me and a shit ton of other people. this is super-exciting  wishing all the best for eric july and his team.
thanks for covering our project! Im so happy with the positive reception we got so far. thanks as part of eric s team!
love the massive support we ve seen for eric. cant wait to get my books next month.
hey mel. thank you for covering this. I am one of rippa s subscribers and have bought into the rippaverse  collecting everything eric has to offer. let me say this. he is onto something huge. the energy and sizzle fans have for something new and authentic is ridiculous. we re all so stoked for the man s success and none of us care that he or his character are black.woke narratives are being dismantled right in front of them and they dont know how to act!
melonie the rippaverse reminds me of image comics 90s producing kickass titles like witchblade darkness and tombraider
let s hope this brings back the era of great american comics
I love how rippa has long said   our side of the internet . the man really is about our nerdy communal space and invites everyone that feels left out into the fold. I have been a fan since he started backwordz  but he rekindled that love for comics I had as a kid over the years with his show for canons sake. which led me to nerdrotic  which led me to g g  which  led me to this channel  so on and so forth. I am super happy for  our side of the internet  as eric so endearingly calls it.
I like that people like you and razorfist are showing some love to the rippaverse. just bought a copy of his comic. even though Ive been more into manga than comics lately.
plus I love that you brought back the verse of the day. youre the best and we love you.
this is so amazing. something really good. not all this woke crap. I support erik 100  I hope this goes far.
awesome
excited too.  haven t bought anything comic related since the early 90s
it is certainly refreshing.
proton
agree. for now. at some point someone will ruin a great and positive thing. it is the way of the butthurt.
Im a victim of being handsome and brave.
I feel like digital panels just dont do it for me.
totally will you man. the artwork in modern comic books sucks today. they act like its a crime to draw superheroines who look like beautiful women. and they act like women s breasts have to constantly be hidden to avert the male gaze.
my sister is not that good of an artist. but she has drawn better art than a few comic artists since she was 10.
thank you so much  this really is encouraging and means a lot
Im gonna second that. include the verses  anyone who is repelled by that wouldn t support your channel in the first place.
another atheist here who agrees  also there is still wisdom in many Bible verses even if you do not believe they were handed down by a divine creator.
@melonie mac go boom  another atheist checking in. I agree you should talk about whatever you want on your channel. Im here for your tomb raider content.  -  fwiw the verse of the day doesnt feel forced and there s nothing wrong with sharing insights that inspire you  whatever the source.
as an atheist as well  I also appreciate them. I grew up in a Christian household and see the value in religion. just because I dont view the events in the Bible as literally true doesnt mean the entire religion is worthless. religion is incredibly beneifical to society  and I respect it.besides  plenty of Christians dont literally think the Bible is factual. most of the stories are modal lessons  life advice  thatsort of thing. thats useful to anyone.
she uses it as a talking point we can all relate to and I think exposure to people different from us is important for us to remain loving to one another. God bless mac
have any atheists in this thread heard the gospel before
@casey chupinski  probably most of us have. and we made our decision of what to believe thusly. its not like people just go into itsaying  yeah no I dont believe in God  they hear both sides of the argument  and make a decision.I have noticed however that the number of people who have read the entire Bible almost always end up converting to Christianity  compared to the number who read the Bible and still reject it. this could be that you were already primed to be a Christian and that lead you to being willing to read the book in the first place  so maybe its designed to indoctrinate a specific mindset of person  but it could also just be that the Bible is truly  the way  and everyone who has not read it is unfortunately ignorant.because Im telling you  the Bible has an insanely high success rate. it has a better recruitment rate than isis  though at a slower pace.I also notice that theres very few atheists who actually side with conservatives politically. I refer to it as  the Christian right  because that pretty much sums up the vast majority of the conservative spectrum. but there are a few of us who dont accept God and still fight for conservative values. in fact  I support your right to have your Bible  and prayer  and teachings in school even if I dont believe in it.
I guess I ll jump on the atheist train. Im a subscriber. I do duck at verses. but they are totally up to you to continue.
1
atheist here too. I will say that while I do leave at the verse part  I wouldn t want you to feel the need to stop sharing what you believe based on people like me. its what you enjoy and feel inspired to share  I would never want to make you feel like you should stop. I love your content otherwise  that part is just not for me and that is okay.
you guys are great feeling the

same here. agnostic.
@casey chupinski  yes. I was a Christian like my parents but reading the whole Bible from start to the end made me an atheist after I saw all the evil in that book and how evil and twisted and sadistic Bible God is. if he was a real God we as a humanity should fight against him and destroy him. it is good that he is just a jewish and Christian mythology.
@kugrox  you could always ask why I believe instead of assuming you know that much about me. I hated God until he made his presence known to me in the darkest hour of my life. you  and every other atheist should at least read or watch  the case for Christ  by lee strobel. he s one of many atheists who went the full distance to  prove  that Christianity was false  and ended up becoming one of the most prolific evangelists.people make the choice to do stupid stuff  or really whatever suits their own ends every day  but few are willing to accept the truth that there is much more evidence for Jesus being the son of God than they want to admit. the idea of moral accountability is scary  and despite Jesus doing all the work on our behalf  people still throw it in Gods face.as an atheist  do you honestly believe that nothing created everything  atheism is a scientific impossibility  and gives no account for where all the matter in the universe comes from  or where good and evil come from. if there is no objective moral yardstick separate from people  then our ideas of good and evil are totally meaningless. you might think rape is evil  but rapists dont  and if good and evil come from people  they re actually just as justified as anyone else doing what they believe is  good . think about it.
@zarddin  youre wrong about that. you ve never read what the Bible says  you ve read how you feel into it. you dont understand how bad people are  yet you admit that no one is a paragon of morality. Im not going to try and convince you out of what you believe  youre pretty rude and we re called to not throw pearls of wisdom before swine  or rather people who willfully dont want to get it. far be it from me to speak to you about a God that tells us to love our enemies  pray for those who persecute us  help people that cannot help themselves  or reach out to a world that hates us for what we believe. but if you only want to do a surface level reading of the most verified book in history  and decide to use your own meaning  instead of what the Bible actually says  then thats on you  and youre going to have to live with the consequences of your actions. I hope you change your mind before judgement day  because up until that time Jesus wants to offer you the forgiveness he offers everyone else. its up to you to take him up on that  or not.
@kugrox  could you tell me what the gospel is  then
@casey chupinski  as long as you pick only the nice clean parts of the mythology you believe in everyt5hing will be fine. most verified book in history  - this is just a lie and Christians should not lie.I wont change my mind about any of the 500 mythologies and Gods sorry. fear is what drives you and forces you to believe in this mythology and the fear you feel is based on how this God is about murdering and torturing people. sorry but Im not afraid like you - mythologies and Gods do not make me feel fear - only people who follow them do.have a good day.
@zarddin  its actually not a lie at all  but heaven forbid you find out the Bible is true  you might have to admit that your wrong  and there s a strong chance that you ll be held morally accountable to God himself. I think thatscares you. if you jump out of a plane and dont believe in gravity  it really doesnt matter. youre going to hit the ground at full speed  and you ll only have yourself to blame. its much more likely that you get your ideas of the Bible from pop culture  I really dont think you ve read any of it at all  and thats kind of sad that you would let a world that hates you do all the thinking for you.fear didn t make me cry out to God in my darkest hour  when I didn t believe in him. and fear didn t make me believe in him when he showed me how compassionate he is  despite my preconceived ideas about his character.and what  nice clean parts  would there be  I look at the word of God as a whole  no Christian cherry picks. we all understand exactly what itsays  and are humbled by how gracious God has really been to us.historical evidence of the Bible s veracity is actually so overwhelming  that your take is literally nothing but ignorance. do youreally think if it wasn t verified  it wouldn t be hard to disprove  tell you what  why dont you  prove  it isn t real. you would be rich overnight  and probably be the most famous person in history. its not like a ton of people have tried to do just that and all of them wound up as believers  or anything.you too  God bless you.
@zarddin  you know what  Im sorry. it really cant be easy to be you. I dont want to be mean to you  but none of us are perfect. if you have issues  I shouldn t make it worse by drawing attention to them. I ll be praying for you  that yourealize the truth  and turn from the lies of the world. talking to stubborn people doesnt do any good  no matter how right you are. I do hope you get saved one day  seriously. God bless you  and adios.
@casey chupinski  the irony and straw men and red herring are sweet.pray for me. I will think for you.
in a decade  nah  2-3 years. people are tired.
just shows the wolves in sheep s clothing all along
go and write. it would be nice to see more people be creative and not be afraid. who knows where you might go...
fuck it  you guys are awesome. Im going to try and see what I can come up with. to give a hint  I like mythology  breserk  and the souls series
may  I recommend the anatomy of story by john trubyalso when executing an action or event in a story on the micro and macro levels the order issetup  situation   twist  resolution and then new equilibrium.
@theonewhitefalcon  go for it follow your passion talent.
aprille r I haven t bought new comics or been in a comic shop since 2006 just been buying back issues.Im also buying eric s comics.
@powerbad696  I cant wait for my isom book to come in
being anti-woke is as big a money maker as being pro-woke. possibly more so.with crowd funding basically everyone is just throwing money at things that oppose their enemies  and thats probably the correct thing to do.
the rippaverse is not  anti-woke   its just non-woke... big difference
and yeah  just because you become a Christian doesnt mean you wont ever sin again. but as a Christian  you should be striving to do better. and be an example of Christ to others. and if you say youre a Christian but there is no evidence of Christ in your life  then maybe youre not  and you need to talk to God about that.
even as someone who has never been spiritual or religious at all  I can still appreciate the Bible verse sections  as itstill often contains ideas that are helpful in everyday life  especially with a personal interpretation added on top. it also adds something to differentiate you from other channels  if all I was looking for was    anti-woke    videos there are countless channels I could turn to  but many I subscribe to have something that makes them stand out from each other  which is what makes me enjoy watching. plus  not all content needs to be for everyone  thats part of the problem with  woke  content is that it tries to appeal to everyone but ends up appealing to no one. your unique perspective on an otherwise similar idea is what makes you interesting to watch  instead of another npc talking head
just so you know  I found your channel by accident and enjoyed everything you said about eric and the rippaverse. but it was your  verse of the day  that made me subscribe.
excellent vod  mel! Im agnostic and I always liked hearing your verse of the day. I personally believe that the Bible s stories are merely symbolic that teach valuable lessons. Imay not be religious but I do have Christian-like beliefs   views. this is an interesting comic that I believe will be good and I hope this goes far. I love the massive support erik has been receiving. ofc the woke crowd that treat marginalized groups as victims   pretend to support said groups are attacking him and his comic just because he isn t acting like a victim nor being woke. they always call us non-woke racist  misogynist  homophobe  etc  when in reality they are and they prove it all the time. they truly dont want marginalized people to succeed in life.
let me tell you that the biggest surprise when I first watched one of your vids was the Bible verses. I can go out and find other vids regarding today s topic  and I have seen plenty of vids praising the success of rippaverse  but you sharing your faith through these verses is what makes this channel stand out. thank you for being thoughtful to your viewers  and I get this is not meant to be a  Christian channel   but I think what you are doing is fine  and that is me understating this.
good for rippa. the hacks need to know their place.
just ordered issue  1  thanks for the encouragement! dont worry about what others think  if you want or need to share a verse  do it!
they always say find dont be our customers or make your own. when somebody does like they say they will still talk bad so these people are the most unhappiest people alive they will literally run you out of a fandom and follow you to where ever you go its sad
great stuff melonie  Im glad eric is doing this and succeeding
as to these claims that we shouldn t be pushing a message in our media  I would say we need to since we are enveloped in a world pushing its own agenda on us constantly so I dont see a problem with eric doing itso long as it isn t obnoxious. I just personally think that is where we are at right now and kudos to eric for doing what he is. I bought a signed copy after watching your video because it makes me happy. good video as always and keep it up!
originally was going to just buy 1 copy to support him but after the little bit on info about the comic s universe got me more hyped that I got a signed copy to collect   a shirt too.
Im excited for a project thatstands on its own  and the quality advertized looks peak.  seen some youngrippa videos  but I never knew he had this up his sleeve!  immediately bought in.melonie  thanks for bringing in a verse at the end.  Im not a very rigorous Christian  but I like that you include these in your videos.  when something really speaks to you I hope you ll always share it.
Im pretty excited. I tried getting into comics a few years ago and fell off after 2 separate series. even if I dont end up getting into this  my son can learn to read with them if it works out for the long run.
this is awesome  a lot of people have said it but it really does remind me of when image started out and you had talented artists and writers breaking away from the big two and doing their own thing. it would be awesome if isom could be the next spawn
this will be the first comic book Ive ever bought in my life  really looking forward to reading it and seeing how the rippaverse develops.
you ve certainly thought alot about getting that balance between time spent with Bible verse of the day segments and your social commentary topics - I love everything about your channel   and that was a great verse of the day  which I needed to hear - also  mad respect to youngrippa!
I love this!!!! I have been watching your channel for several months  and am sooooo happy to see a beautiful woman with brains and a level head in today s world! thank you for giving us single men  and everyone else watching  some hope and showing us great examples of how traditional values can come back! keep it up!
its hilarious to see the true villains out here reaching with their lies and slander towards something good . everything will come to light .
so proud for eric july and the rippaverse!!! Im all for supporting him  and did!
bought cover a the day pre-orders went live. bought cover b friday. will be buying cover c as well. the indie comics scene is gradually refueling my passion for western comics.
2.5 million! !  heck yeah!!! go rippa!!!
aw bless
great news. thanks for telling us Im not much of a comics guy -  but I appreciate the news that the wokeys are being shunted to the side.
picked up a signed copy of cover b of the first issue. so hyped to see the support for rippa culture growing.
I haven t bought a comic since the last walking dead. thats soon to change. I hope this momentum continues and he shakes the industry on top of its head like ecw did in wrasslin back in the mid 90s.
Im going to preorder his book this week. good to see you go  boom
I bought my signed copy yesterday! I cant wait to read it and post about itso more people will want to read it!!!!
happy for the success of the rippaverse. good to see you back to your og format but keep doing what you do and experimenting to see what works best for you.
now eric has hit  3m I hope he widens the project to providing help to other creators for cheaper uncensored crowd funding that isn t gate kept. he has the platform.
hey melanie old fan used to watch back in the day only stopped cuz I stopped with game content all together really but rediscovering you now your stuff is still great! will definitely watch every vid you make on this channel I haven t disagreed once we need more influencers not afraid to speak against this clownery
didn t expect you to pay attention to the rippaverse  . still shocked you heard about this really didn t see this video coming  keep up the good work
I cant wait to receive my copy of isom  1. rippaverse is what comics need
this rippaverse ride is all gas and no brakes! cant stop  wont stop!
did you notice in the description of isom eric doesnt describe the character as black. he just describes isoms mentality and what drives him. he concentrates on who the character is  not how black his character is. and I love this
love your takes on culture. Im not a Christian  but I also appreciate your verses of the day and your views on why you choose them. beliefs are important and so is respect of others and their beliefs.
use to collect comics but stopped about 10 years ago when their stories stopped. bought a signed copy of isom. hope to grab future works as well.
happy for rippa eric july s success. spent a couple of bills on his merchandise and Im excited to see the 3nd product! and Im happy for what this comic launch is doing on a larger scale for normal  common sense-exercising geek culture. as eric has said time and time again  we dont need to rely on the  old guard  for our entertainment and hobbies. especially if we re in america  we can do whatever we set our minds to  as you also said in the video. enough is enough. Ive definitely been motivated by rippa to keep going with my own writing and drawing projects with more hope!and thank you for finally addressing the verse of the day elephant in the room lolI respect your reasoning for cutting back on the Bible verses  and while I definitely miss them at the end of every video  I honestly see a different reason why maybe its better if you cut them out as you were doing them up til now  in a sense  including that and the comment replies on every video was a little too much  and as a result made the videos look kind of sloppy.I dont think you were being forceful in sharing a Bible verse and your thoughts on it. you talked about the Bible in a way that was welcoming for anyone to listen in and hear how Christians actually talk about the Bible  and I know  from comments  it benefitted a lot of people who aren t even believers  and many times was a blessing to me. but for the sake of your channel s marketability  it would probably be best to keep each video on-topic and have a clear end point when the topic is over  but definitely find ways to make your faith known and share the gospel in any way you can. pray on it and I know that I and your other Christian viewers will definitely pray for you  and I know God always gives us a way to witness  even when itseems impossible for us   but whatever you do  make sure youre not dropping the verse segment because youre ashamed of Christ. thats something only you and the holy spirit can know.and last of all  related to the awesome verse you shared today  romans 6  worth studying in depth. Ive memorized it entirely and its a great soul-cleanser to repeat and meditate on.God bless you  youre a huge blessing and I pray that you stay strong in the faith
first they ignore you  then they laugh at you  then they fight you  then you win.  -ghandi
I bought two copies  one being a signed copy. I cant wait to get my hands on them and read it. I hope its good.
I am broke asf but purchased one copy of his comic. rippa has caused a stir in the comic book industry for legit doing it his own way and funding it with his own money and the wokies cant stand it! all they do is demand and act as entitled spoilt brats and this kills them inside to see a black  hard-working man who wants to make comics great again succeed. God bless eric and God bless you melonie too.
thanks for letting people know about this mel!
I haven t bought a comic book in over two decades and I bought three copies of this. I support the idea that companies should exist to provide good products to everyone regardless of personal opinions or politics. same reason why I bought some of jeremy s coffee even though Im not a big coffee guy.
yes!
same here!
which cover did you get  I got cover a. then after ordering he announced cover c.
@max davies  cover a
@jeepgladiator1975  high five
@max davies  just bought cover b last night.
the haters are going to extreme lengths to try to find dirt on the ripperverse  some of them dont even make sense. but the fans have spoken  there are more of us than there is of the haters. cantell by that 2.5mil in just a few days. I cant wait for them to come out and what future stories and characters come out of this.
hImelonie I hope your weekend wasnice for you  your family  thankyou for another wonderful episode.ialways look forward to seeing what you are bringing on your chanel.takecare melonie
loved the video  really felt the passion and excitement here    Ive been weary of marvel for years since civil war. now its a shame because I grew up and learned all my morals from superheroes. shame what they re doing to what we love everywhere.
great news  stories should be just stories not focused on things actual fans dont care about
glad that people are realizing that they dont need big corporations to tell their stories. if you want something done right  you gotta do it yourself.
he knew all of our old fandoms have been overrun with the woke folks who poisoned and demolished them. he leave them all and make our own. he s doing that
itsucks being unemployed with no    in the discretionary fund.if he made twitter mad then you know he s doing something amazing. I hope his success continues to go above and beyond the  2 million in revenue due to his campaign.
that verse really spoke to me as a catholic. I dont know other denominations that have confession  but its something we re taught that confession isn t a hand wash station. you dont get to go out friday night and do a bunch of blow and exhaust yourself at an orgy since hey- I ll just hit up saturday confession and Im all good! noooo. thats what I was taught to be  presumption . it also hit me as a defender of the faith when so many people like to bash me because of that very misconception. oh you catholics think you can do whatever the hell you want because hey  I ll just go say sorry to the priest and its all good!noooooo!granted I wont ever claim that there are those that dont carry themselves that way. but it is not the way.anyway  yeah I just had a couple cents I wanted to throw in the pot lol.
now such is what I enjoy seeing. a team making their own thing and making changes to the industry on their own power instead of changing something which already exists.extra casual witch with Christian and agnostic friends  with a realization you cant just corral good into a small pool  goodness must extend outward.
not a Christian but Im happy to see the verse of the day back. thats not why I watch your videos but your faith is a part of you and one thing I like about your videos is that you put yourself into them... meaning that without the verse of the day something is missing.keep up the good work.
very happy for him melonie..
I cant wait to read this comic I ordered on the day it was up for pre order
I got my two copies coming. got a signed copy that will be put into safety cover  because you never know if it might be worth somethingsome day. and my copy to read through.
also never be ashamed to share your faith because thats super important
its hard to understate what july has done. his  isom  comic is likely the first comic book since the 90s to sell a million units. despite years of steadily declining sales of comicbooks in the us  itshows there s still demand for the medium.
ripperverse s comics is a success story without the need of race card  special privileges  etc. Bible verse is back again.
the fact the left has been openly dropping hard rs should be so eye opening for regular people
just the synopsis for isom  1 displays better plotting than most modern marvel and dc comics.
his rant against woke fired netflix employees was hilarious.
getting coverage from razorfist  hotep Jesus  and you.  eric s getting around
thank you so much! bless
@melonie mac go boom  you too
he s a legend. love to see him monetizing his haters too  he always owns them
he deserves all his success - I am so happy for him
eric has their attention! they are seeing the storm on the horizon.
I really respect this gal a lot. she s a really bright really decent person.
saw you on friday night tights live stream a couple weeks ago.  very happy I did  love your content awesome videos!!
marvel s daredevil s faith is a big part of matt murdock s life   character story. these people are hypocrites!  deundwokehollywood
longer vids are good. go as long or short as you feel you need to get your point across.
I completely gave up on american comics after the art took a crap and everything was full of woke garbage  mostly investing my time instead in manga. this will be the first american comic that Ive picked up in 15  years. so stoked to see rippa crushing it and looking forward to checking out his new comics!
I feel like alot of media sources have lost the plot on telling a story. if you want to show a man as strong dont just say he s strong show him doing something requiring strength  or a smart woman show her using her intelligence in a similar way. instead they shoehorn in things thatshould be secondary to the story telling process and act like they have achieved something from it.
its like I always say melonie  these woke people need to take a freaking nap
melonie are there any plans on joining the cast of geeks and gamers  would love to see you do a cross over with them  young rippa  friday night tights
I showed up to buy the comics  but I stay to watch all the meltdowns.
my first  memories its a first time to read comics captain america  the night in my bed  I never forget that  when stan lee  left usthere will never be another stan lee. for decades it has offered young and old adventure  escape  comfort  confidence  inspiration  strength  friendship and joy. he exuded a great deal of love and kindness and will leave an indelible mark on many  many
eric is killing it and Im happy to support him  gina daily wire  the fnt gang  yourself and anyone else who can deliver message-free content...and unsub from the rest. eventually  the suits will start caring about making money again and dump the ideologues that have ruined so many ips
the world is slowly rediscovering the joys of merit based accomplishments.
melonie is so beautiful  I lost myself in her
the rise of the rippaverse is meteoric  the dinosaurs at dc and marvel better watch out
acts 5 42 calls for us to preach Christ daily. st francis of assisI purportedly called for us to  preach the gospel at all times and if necessary  use words.  please keep sharing your faith  building up the body. those who choose to listen will continue to do so. those who wont can just skip the end of the videos. I pray that you continue to do so in the hope of reaching that one person who needs to hear  and like saul  sees the light of our Lord and savior.
isom may be a Christian superhero  now he s my favorite superhero!
I agree with what you say about your faith  100 . to me  if you were forceful and heavy handed with it  that would be hypocritical to what you say about comic books being too pushy with the writer s beliefs and or political views.  d
yay!  verse of the day is back!  maybe you could make it verse of the week
i.accept responsibility and credit for this video because I tweeted @ her. youre welcome.kidding  thanks for making this video melonie
I was on friday night tights last march  in case you missed it. Im always happy to collab more with them when they want to  amazing crew  d
@melonie mac go boom  I definitely missed that. I gotta go back and watch it
Ive got thousands of comic books yet back in 2012 I turned my back on it due to all the garbage being sold to us it just wasn t worth it to collect anymore happy to say there s something worth buying again
just ordered my copy while listening  I chose cover b  gotta be a little against the grain  lol
long love the rippaverse
its so funny how these woke clowns threw racial slurs at eric and immediately deleted it as if no one screenshot or archived it. they re proving his point about victimization
if I close my eyes  I can picture candace owens talking and I absolutely adore her.
about the verse of the day- I liked it because it was a distinct  melonie mac  thing  it makes your channel stand out. I dont think a few minutes of a Bible verse towards the end of a video about gaming is going to net you the  Christian content creator  label. anybody familiar with you knows that your content is mainly gaming  not religion. its not the sermon on the mount from a gaming chair  lol. if someone is put off by you sharing a small bit of your faith  while everyone else openly expresses their political social views and whatnot  then they aren t the type of fan you need.
razorfist the other day called what young rippa is doing the beginning of  the iron age  of comics. I really like that  and I hope it catches on
am sooo happy  the he tide is turning in pop culture  entertainment  and rippaverse unmasked these hypocrites...btw  you are cute  honestly!
I think the verse of the day is refreshing. people dont believe in anything anymore. so this is nice to see and hear
last week a guy just helped me at the airport and I said  thanks so much man  I really appreciate it . immediately his face turned sour and he said  just a heads up  but youreally shouldn t say that to people because I identify as a woman. Im cool but many of us find that offensive . ffs this person had a beard and was obviously a guy. I cant stand this woke nonsense anymore. Ive never felt so out of place and disconnected with our world.
I freaking love this!!! time for this woke nonsense to disappear. as an autistic with my mouth being non-filtered  I was told I cant say this and I cant say that. well I dont care anymore. love the Bible verses at the end.  well done melonie! keep fighting!
Im interested in what s to come.
your channel is awesome  melonie! great video  babe! keep it up! the rippaverse will be forever  while dc and marvel will fall!
how do I get a hold of this comic
yo! did you just make a street fighter reference at 0 20!   cos that was a lit quarter forward punch!
I know the rippaverse is the hype at the moment and rightfully so  but independent comics have been doing fine. its only the established western publishers who are struggeling  both in comics and gaming there a lot of exciting projects in the work by people who were either pushed out of the industry or took matters into their own hands.
you might say its had a major rippal effect. get it  I ll see myself out...
thatsuperkiller is vito s comic... hes salty af
he has over a million locked up by pay pal from international customers thatsays alot international buyers never come in that fast usually this is big
so far I have liked and greed on everything our favorite  beautiful  Christian princess!  you are truly a ray in the darkness..
thank you
@melonie mac go boom  anytime!
yeah but Jesus doesnt exist.
@dragon ball fans cant read  he does exist.   I dont know why you people aren t offended by allah or the hindu Gods  or what the japanese believe in. its always Jesus thats offending people  even though his not here  but his coming back soon. guess you feel hurt thatsomeone real existed and perform miracles while you cant.
Jesus does exist. I bumped into him in aldI last week. he was taller than I expected and smelled a bit like a honey badger.
youtube protects accounts like db from any kind of scrutiny
thank you soooo much
@melonie mac go boom  Im so sorry for not getting the spelling right. as an austrian I should always do spellcheck..lol
as someone who isn t a believer I normally tune out when it gets to the verse of the day. Im guessing a lot of non believers do that which might disappoint the youtube algorithm.
rippa go booooooooom!!!
hImel  the left claims to be so inclusive  but there s no room for anyone who has sincere religious views.
already jumped on this band wagon 5 years ago with ethan van sciver and richard meyer.
con-tin-ew-ittyanother banger video!  3
nice set up!
hey melonie I just want to tell you that we need more of rippaverse  bc he is right bout how we need to destroy woke people and have them stop bullying us and leave us alone and let us go with our lives  ok melonie. anyway I just want to tell you that and tell you that we need more of rippaverse and have woke people be destroyed and leave us alone. anyway I just want to tell you that  ok melonie. anyway hope you have a wonderful and great blessed day and evening at home with your pets melonie. anyway have a great evening and good night melonie.
aspirational and uplifting thats how I want my comics now and so does everyone else who was kicked out of the mainstreamthere can be some nuance in there but we sorely need something not leftist propaganda garbage
I dont get what the problem is  the activist have flat out said they dont want money from all these  racist  biggotted  homephobic ect  ect  people  so they took their hateful money elsewhere. they got exactly what they asked for and now theyre mad  some people just cant be happy
do a separate video on faith or do it on the sabbath.
Im really looking forward to this. I want to enjoy comics and good story telling without people s personal politics interfering. cant wait to see woke people complain about this lol. keep up the good work mac!
says a lot when they go absolutely berserk against a black man who goes against their narrative and show their true colors in the process.
I ordered rippa s book. he s earned a chance to prove his work  but Im not an elitist snob. if I like the book  I ll buy the next. if I dont I wont. simple.I dont mind the verse of the day  but then I dont hate God. on the contrary. but I understand the structuring of a platform  like this channel for its intended purpose. perhaps this channel is not the forum for sharing your faith  you could always have an alternate channel for that. many of your peers do that.but I dont think sharing faith requires making people listen to you expound the Bible when they came to hear a commentary on some secular thing like in this case the rippaverse. you live your faith day to day  and God gives us his spirit by faith. its written  the just shall live by faith.  when you make Christ the king in your own life  you dont really have to tell people youre doing that. it ll be evident. but it will also grate on people who God didn t call out  or are more concerned with the here and now.  if you were of the world the world would love its own but youre not of the world for I have called you out of it.  all I am trying to say  I guess is dont be ashamed of your faith  but it doesnt mean you have to force it on anyone either. just dont be afraid to praise Jesus and glorify God. people will think youre stupid for it  but again the world will hate you.I like your channel and if you had a separate channel where you shared what the word means to you  I d check it out too.
got my signed book ordered
yeah and now that the rippaverse has made over 3 million dollars in one week. the nay sayers  are starting to pushing the narrative that the books are priced too high. ummm if they brought in 3 million  that must mean people are buying them and if people are buying them  then duh  they re not priced too high. sure maybe the price will need to come down in future issues. but that is almost always the case when a new product comes on the market. and dont kid yourselves  this is brand new product and everyone knows the first issue of a comic book is almost always worth money.
its refreshing to see a comic creator not woke snd doesnt rely on pandering like mainstream books do now days. also you look very nice melonie.
paypal blocked him from accessing a significant amount of money for purchases.
its so sad even the boys show has turned into a cringey whole mess. every episode of season 3 had woke garbage. it was minimal and passable in the previous seasons but this one really killed it for me. Im done with them
the woke jokes are choking on the rippaverse!!!
I had never heard of the ministry school. and I dont think eric is a Christian himself at least Ive never gotten that impression from him
ill fix thatsentense for you  some people just wants to watch the world burn
thank you for the heart  melonie!
eric is a Christian
the only thing that could make all of this more entertaining is if his first character was a white dude  just to make them even angrier.
great work
looks cool  thanks for suggesting it. spawn is a black man aswell  who initially is  but doesnt stay a victim. same for black panther  not a victim but a black ruler. and those two are never mentioned by those wokism-nazis  even tho they are glaring examples of strong  original black heroes. doesnt fit their power hungry agenda.
I found him through friday night tights
the punisher is catholic. he knows where he s going  but its a sacrifice he s willing to make.
melonie  Im not a Christian. not an atheist either  I dont think about it much.if you want the Bible verse  keep it. regardless  I often learn a little something despite having no faith. doesnt bother me in the slightest.
hey! mel!  watching from south africa     ...love your chanel and videos keep it up . oh and I cant believe you are 35!  you look 22
I hope you dont take this the wrong way but Christian support shouldn t seem like a punishment or like your loosing opportunities. just for example chris pratt had so much success not bashing religious people and instead giving them an uplifting voice. that voice in some very small part has helped his career while he showed strength in his convictions. actors who were not Christian came out in his support and so did his fans. jurassic world out performed lightyear in its 2nd week at theaters when lightyear came out. however since then pratt has changed his tune and claimed he is not that religious and religion is oppressive af. I dont know if this will affect his success but with marvels current downward protectory Im not so sure I can stay hyped for vol.3. if it fails to bring the bacon im sure the wokies will have a field day with pratt and celebrate that they finally took him down.
today s vid should b titled  this  that  and the other
mel  Im gonna be honest  I almost unsubscribed because of a lack of incoming content. would be nice to get a greater frequency of videos to keep things fresh. thatsaid  glad to see you haven t quit your channel. keep it up!rippaverse comics is definitely a win for the consumer - a bold statement about entertainment today. the fans are tired of the agendas  the social justice  the garbage narratives  and I think there is a revolution on the horizon where indies will explode like never before and the usual corporatists will see their profits  what little they make now  sliced and diced.edit  just to chime in on the verse of the day  my take on it is  either its all grace  or its no grace. grace plus works is still works and therefore merit based. if its merit-based then we are adding to the cross of Christ  but Jesus said on the cross   it is finished.  btw  if you want to do a verse of the day  do a verse of the day. if you dont want to.. dont. lol I dont think anyone is judging you on that.
I think you might be surprised at how many non Christians have been watching your videos. dont be too concerned about that. however  I do respect your choice to not do it as much. to increase your audience sometimes it is better to preach less and just have a good conversation.
Ive never bought a comic in my entire miserable life  but Im gonna buy 50 copies of this!!! also  does anybody know how to change to lowercase letters on an iphone 3
he is great example of how capitalist can make wealth  in contrast to commies that you talk about  victims of their lazyness...
if it helps  con-ti-nu-ity.
maybe they can learn something from this.   that would mean they have the capacity to learn  which I seriously doubt they do.God is very forgiving.  if we sin  we just have to ask God to forgive us and try not to sin again.  but we re still in the flesh.  we just have to keep asking God to forgive us and do our best.  thats all he wants.  we will never be perfected until either we die and go to heaven or Jesus comes for the church and takes us to heaven.  once saved always saved is the doctrine of the nicolaitanes which Jesus Christ himself says he hates  revelation 2 15-16 .  the only sacrifice we have to do now is repent  ask Jesus into our lives as our Lord and savior  then if we find ourselves stumbling  repent of the sin and ask God to help us.  thats what I do  and Ive overcome a lot of things I used to do.  Im still working out a few issues with God  but I know I can break them sooner than later.
yeah  I wouldn t cut out your verse of the day  melonie.  its far too late in the day to be ashamed of the gospel.
you should try to get the rights to write the tomb raider comics.
michael b jordan would be perfect for this as a movie  I think he s pretty smart so I doubt he s a woke democrat.
go boom
I dont understand. comics have always been political or  woke  before the term ever existed. x-men   civil rights. wonder woman   feminism  progress of women  captain america   literally antI fascist  not the way  antifa  is being used today  daredevil   rich exploiting the poor. there s even a hulk story from the 80s about the israel palestine conflict. dont see anything new here. hopefully isom is a good story. have any of these people actually read a comic or full story arc  all this just reminds me that we re getting older and turning into the  well back in my day .  folk. the problem is bad lazy writing and boring art. not  wokeness   its always been there.
well thatsucks that you would almost unsubscribe over that. if this were my full time gig I d understand  but this channel does not pay my bills and I cannot always make it a daily priority all the time when I have other obligations. thats an unreasonable of an expectation to put on someone.
@melonie mac go boom  I understand your position  but Im just being honest. dont mean to put pressure on you  its just I saw a drop in content so I thought I would say what maybe others might be thinking and give you some feedback. I like your content  Im still subscribed  and I hope you will continue to put out content in the future. thanks for replying.
nahh
hebrews 10   26 is one of those verses in the Bible that is hard to understand without context. it can cause a lot of fear and stress for saved people by making them think they can lose their salvation because they didn t live  right  enough. the context of this scripture has to do with animal sacrifice and israel continuing the sin of offering animal sacrifices for their sins after receiving the knowledge of the truth  that Christ paid for all sin once and for all . continuing to offer animal sacrifice for sins in the face of the truth that Christ died for all sins is blatant rejection of the cross which is why for those that kept doing this there remains no more sacrifice for their sins. their trust is in the animal sacrifice and not the sacrifice Jesus made for them. this verse is not talking about saved people living in sin or not living sinless enough. saved souls are sealed with the holy spirit  ephesians 1   13 kjv  and made righteous by the blood of Jesus  romans 5   19 kjv . Christians will struggle with sin until the day they die however no sin can make unrighteous what Jesus has made righteous by his blood.
they also dont want an ordinary person becoma a millionaire  lterally  overnight. that person is now rich enough to not be controlled
there would never have been any criticism of the perceived religion of the character if the character had been muslim or jewish. this sort of thing only - and always - happens with Christian characters.its almost like there s a massive  organized effort to demonize and tear down genuine Christianity in the west as a whole or something.and its been going on for decades.Im not even a religious person  but when an entire religion is being corrupted and demonized  even someone like myself can see something massively wrong with that  especially when one of the founding principles of the u.s. is  indeed  religious freedom.
I put a lot of stock into his idea of a parallel economy.
hmm  should I support bad art  art that looks like something Ive done in my high-school years  and that has mediocre colouring  the obvious standard magic lasso and gradient brush photoshop combo  or should I support it because of the political messaging and grifting thats behind this product that the creator is trying to push  peddle and opportunistically prey on   would this product done as well as it did if it didn t had an anti-woke narrative behind it  could it had stand on its own   if the anti-woke stuff was an organic by-product of the story then fine great ... but its not  its a the main selling and grifting point for this product.  its great the guy saw an opportunity to gamble and make some money off of the anti-woke grift just as it was great that anita sarkeesian made her money with her grift  the same ideological monetary predication.  people are so easily fooled sold and or corralled into tribe to be exploited on their mob lemming mentality.
instead of worrying about one single thing like slavery  that had nothing to do with anyone alive today... why dont we ask questions as to why people never got to fly on a airplane  or drive in a car ! !  think of how many people never got to experience that. the sensation of speed  or views from extremely high altitudes. things we take for granted everyday. electricity  air conditioning... simple amenities and luxuries. why didn t people get to experience that  why was everyone riding horses and traveling by boats  its the same concept  just reversed.
holy shit I was sub so long ago made a new account glad to see you are not woke!!!!!
a couple of things to note here  you might not feel like a victim of whatever and good for you  but that does not mean you can decide others aren t when viewed through the lense of your own experiences. a comic book doesnt have to say anything in the text to be woke. you keep inadvertently comparing fiction and reality throughout this video. last of all  comics have always been political so its an interesting criticism in 2022. all good and bad political ideas have been presented in all media. a contrarian pov doesnt make this comic different from the crowd.
are you going to meet him at anime matsuri
she gets it
nahh its hero or whoever who just happen to be whichever and letting people find out on there own because I believe in an audience finding stuff out on there own because I believe there smart enough to  d
melonie  are you going to order rippa s isom comic book
he tricked them in to buying a comic named after the largest Christian school in the world!  ...how do you know thats where he got the name from
this is a gaming entertainment channel....or am I wrong
mainstream media will do their best to smear this.
I almost didn t recognize without your signature black nails
you were never forceful with your faith.  speak life.
Im jewish  never minded the verse thingy even if its not my religion.
how are they able to call this racist in a way thats actually convincing  or are they just simply calling him racist
bless
comics have barely ever been political lol for every vaguely  political  comic there are a thousand non political ones
@richard greene  not a leftist.the conservative party did not fight the nazis. but what s important is that captain america does  to a certain extent  represent my politics. youre assuming all political commentary is far leftist bs. I think you have drank too much of the cool-aid my guy.
already did
@melonie mac go boom  what.... when will it reach you...   how are you feeling about this new opportunity edit  and also congrats on your order too
the tips are black still haha  d

shout out!!
hey ms boombastic.
yo mel!
fifth comment ....Im you right we are tired about  this woke nonsense and message crap
its a chris chan channel
plot twist  all of the rippaverse backers are wokies supporting him because he s black and a  victim
why do these  narratives  hurt you so much though  does it effect your daily life
he is a libertarian. of he wont be a victim or preach to the woke.
if not Bible verse  how about Christian philosophy  something like plantinga s  in religious belief as elsewhere  we must take our chances  recognizing that we could be wrong  dreadfully wrong
@ericjuly is a proud libertarian. he funded all of this out of his own pocket and used no commercial marketing campaign. this is all by viral peer to peer marketing from like - minded people  content creators and fans and subscribers. I am so happy for him and the people that he employs also for the fans who want a book or merchandise from a creator who cares what they think.
why was I never subscribed to you before  I follow you on instagram.
g fuel sent it to me
woohoo!
ruining some of our favorite franchises by hijacking and changing them beyond recognition  like tomb raider for example
@melonie mac go boom  how  on earth was tomb raider ruined  you still played as lara...
@cliffo does gaming  if you dont watch her channel  you would know  she hates the fact that lara  was portraid as vulnerable and a victim  instead of her orgiinal antI hero self from the games. and melonie hates the whole hollwoodization of the tomb raider franchise  to her its just killing what she loves
@silverfox   ahh I see. but you still play as lara and play her story. so it hasnt ruined the franchise at all. Imean she is younger in these reboots than the og ones so she is more vulnerable. plus making her more vulnerable isnt a nareative or  woke .
well thank you for subbing now    better late than never!
@melonie mac go boom  wow I never expected a reply and especially not so fast lol
idk sh about comicbooks. I havent read a comic book since I was 12 and even then I read super obscure stuff  I read this old series with fantaetic art called storm and some the scI fI comic from the same writer I dont know what this is all about. I just want to say its really cool thatso many fellow nerds are rushing to support a black comic book writer and his black character. when the dame nerds are constantly pushed into a corner as racists   sexist etc since the masses have appropriated our nerd culture. our nerd culture that doesnt care about color  gender or race. but that we have tried to defend from thatsuper powerful and vocal minoroty of people who want to make evrry story about modern social issues pushing their pov not realizing that these stories are escapism. not meant to constantly remind us of our world
rippaverse go boom !! to the religion of wokeness!! hec yeah!! let the parallel economy take off like a rocket!! time to cancel the cancelers!! daily wire  gab and now rippaverse !!
that comic is now up to  2.6 million dollars lmao!! his own money ie...no investors and no bank loan....no kickstarter or any other platform....he did itsmart and he is giving us buyers plain entertainment without a social or political agenda!! america has said enough of the woke crap!! he also paid the artist  inker  and the color person more than the big 2 ever did lmao!!
eat moar butter  ppl.
14 30 I have theory isom is named after a 19th century black cowboy outlaw and rancher named isom dart. but international school of ministry  what a reach! lmao
spawn was black. nobody seemed to care back then. it was just a good story. now its all identity politics.
who cares if a character wears a cross  such a stretch lol the postal dude wears a cross on his trench coat and I wouldn t consider him a God loving Christian lmao
such a waste.  so hot yet so mtg-ish for no reason
not to the woke cult left. you are ur minority group. you black gay trans lesbian non binary and thats its. to us that would be apart of the character but to the cult they make it the only thing about the character and there heroes never have any challenge or struggle to overcome. they are great at everything usually.
the comic sucks
people cared back then. al simmons being black was an interesting aspect of the character. it just wasn t all there was to the character.
dont you have some soy you need to be eating somewhere
