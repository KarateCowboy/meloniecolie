this just proves that the cancel mob is a lot smaller and less popular than they like to pretend to be. they can force the hand of cowards and bully smaller platforms  but they dont have the power to veto true popular sentiment. sadly  there s not many things that most people can rally around these days  at least not new things.
the word you are looking for is  colonization . these people are literally trying to populate new spaces and take them over through coercion  intimidation  and eventually violence  all in the name of  tolerance  and   inclusion . never stop fighting  lady. we will support you.
for the intro  I can proudly say  for me  its a mix of all three. the gameplay looks solid  I always wanted to go to hogwarts  and the fact that twitter idiots are getting mad is just a bonus.
its great that you are still out here dropping content for us after all the bs you went thru recently. truly a badass in my opinion
Im not personally a harry potter fan  only saw first 3 movies and dropped out  but I preordered hogwarts legacy.both because I like open world rpgs and because of all the hateful nonsense the game was receiving from lunatic activists. the limited run games incident pushed me over the edge.
I cant wait to play the hogwarts game! I love the world j.k. created and think she herself is a remarkable person for what she accomplished in children s literature.
melonie talking about how games are supposed to be fun experiences made me think back to the first time I played ocarina of time  so many years ago. that was such a bright  new  exciting time. ya felt like a whole new world had been opened up in video games. I d love to have that feeling again  someday. to anyone reading this  do you have a memory like that  perhaps the first time a video game really gave you joy
I haven t looked at anything harry potter since 2007.  Im 34 now and Im interested in playing hogwarts because its a unique fantasy world that looks like you can get lost in.  its called escapism  something these people dont seem to understand.
no normal happy person is going to single out someone and attack them  yes
I preordered my deluxe edition of hogwarts legacy! cant wait to play it
the game does look fantastic. Im hyped for it. youre speaking truth melonie. stay strong. and keep going. God is with you. you look amazing melonie. enjoy your day.
1 50 when melonie realises and seeks forgiveness has to be one of the most wholesome moments Ive seen.
Im not a big harry potter fan.  read a few books and watched the movies.  I have to admit  the game looks really cool and Im excited for the harry potter fans.  however  I d be wary of pre-orders due to the shenanigans new games often go through  but itsure is fun seeing another fan base stand up for themselves.
I like that melonie laughs in the face of the darkness. we need more people like that.
this game looks so good. harry potter was a big part of my childhood so Im excited for it I remember playing the sorcerers stone game on ps1.I had my mind set on being in gryffindor but I did the thing on pottermore and I got sorted in ravenclaw  and took a random test and got ravenclaw too. I think I need to be in that house. but I ll play an evil character thats on slytherin on another playthrough
the more they complain about it  the more copies will sell. its the streisand effect.
its fun to own the wokies sometimes  lol I just recently discovered your channel and Im really enjoying your videos.    you go boom girl.
I think youre the best person Ive seen talk about the woke issue especially when you talk about being a woman and how it effects you. I also like how you incorporate your faith into how bad the woke mob is taking over the church and thats one of the reasons why I left the methodist church because it became woke and I am in the same boat as you!
the game looks really good and itseems the developers who are making the game have a lot of love for the game  the lore and world jk created and usually when the developers really love what they are making we get the most fun and greatest games. look at elden ring  God of war  spider-man   and many many of the other games where the developer could be seen enjoying what they were making and having a lot of love for what they were creating and how happy they would get when the fans of the property showed the developers interest and love for there game.
funny thing is  if it wasn t for the controversy  I wouldn t have bought the game. I watched the movies growing up  but after the last one my interest was pretty much exhausted. haven t watched the fantastic beasts movies and I dismissed the game out of hand  when I first saw the cover of it. but the massive drama around the game brought it to my attention and researching it a bit and watching the  gameplay reveal  just like you say in the video  it frankly looks like an excellent experience. awesome graphics  fluid and cool looking combat and that amazing footage of flying around on your broom over lovingly rendered countryside sold it for me. deluxe edition is preordered and Im positively surprised to be looking forward to a harry potter game. so in summary  imo this is the streisand effect in action  combined with some excellent trailer and gameplay footage.
hopefully we will have warhammer 40k series in few years
talking about cowards  how about daniel radcliffe and emma watson
smaller  plateform loll if you put ubisoft  netflix  amazon  disney  as small
@dorian gray  cowards who crapped on the person who technically gave them their careers and the only movies they re known for.
agree to an extent but  smaller  is a weird term considering some of the most massive companies have been bullied into changing stuff. its more though a case of a small group been very loud to seem bigger then they are. added the super stupid placebo of woke culture and political correctness. weird that a harry potter game though just really shows how little and insignificant these  wokies  actually are  well to most normal people anyways.
I deleted the new God of war because of all the woke shit in it. there s a gay side quest because apparently one of the gay devs boyfriend died. they wouldn t do it for a straight couple  it was just another excuse to pander. calling the fans racist because they took issue with the race swapped characters after they said they wanna respect the lore. then the blue haired person who accepted an award for the game at the game awards just cemented my fears. its getting to the point where I dont even want to game anymore because Im sick of the woke pandering.
exactly  that is why true nerds are gatekeeping from the wokies
mr kopperneoman  while I have you here  did you happen to know that fascism is a form of socialism  if you translate nazI from its original german itstands for  nationalist socialist workers party . the key differences between fascism and communism being that fascism allows for a pseudo free market to exist under the control of the corporations with the state supervising  fascist are more traditionalistic  and they tend to be more nationalistic. though  to be fair to your earlier point  both forms of socialism  communism and fascism  are highly colonial in nature as they conquer neighboring territories through military and economic means  kinda in the same fashion as china is doing with taiwan and globally with the belt and road initiatives.
appropriation not appreciation
which is why you always shame delusional people
facts
just the thought of them wasting their time  writing hate tweets about strangers enjoying a video game will make hogwarts legacy an even better experience.
@silent king  its like a relaxing background music as you fly over the scottish countryside on your hippogriff  the furious clacking of keyboards and angry exhales of the perpetually online.
the people who also created the game also seem like very nice people. they seem to be very transparent and I love the livestreams where they show off gameplay and answer questions. really excited for the release.
this  it actually seems to be a good game and the world is interresting. no need to use the current attention as the sole reason to buy it.
its kind of concerning. the last game these developers made was cars 3 in 2017 that was made for the playstation 3. could have another cyberpunk situation but hopefully not
@dostoyevsky 731 agreed. hoping for the best because I ll likely pick it up  we ll have to wait and see I suppose. never preordering though
@dorian gray  dont forget rupit grint pretty sure me threw jk under the bus aswell
@matthew lyman  100  agree if it wasnt for jk they wouldn t be where they are today absolutele cowards all 3 of them threw jk under the bus for abit clout in my opinion because people hardly seem talk about them anymore and they wanna try to stay relivent
they can and do on social media they still control like reddit  facebook  and tumblr. reddit especially. I posted in support of community togetherness  but because I signaled I was willing to stand next to a blue haired political activist to defend the game community thatsaved my life  the cultists in the highly curated space of d d next downvoted me into oblivion. I am going to keep that post up and wear those downvotes with a badge of honor to show I truly mean what Imeant.
in short  ... its a small minority of grifters  baiters  hustlers    any other word s  that describes these  scoundrel s    because they seem to have the loudest voice  but they do not represent the whole majority  what a world.
wow melonie going to town deleting any comments thatshe dont like. what a hypocrite
@the delivery moogle  quite probably. I only remember daniel and emma.  jk rowling never said anything transphobic she was only standing up for biological women
@blox117  really   I hadn t noticed that is disappointing to hear if true.  what was itshe deleted
its not colonization if nobody is living in the said land.
colonization equals civilization. dont compare nationalist colonizers to the tolerance and inclusion mob. national socialism is waaaaaay different from democratic socialism. one seeks to put your people and family first. the other forces wages to pay for outsiders you are forced to consider invaders as neighbors.
from dehydration and a stalker to belting out banger after banger of a video. melonie s on fire lately
preorder may be a mistake  I personally dont predict this game dropping on release date just based on history  rdr2 and cyberpunk
@deth incarnate  I wasn t going to pre order for that reason  but the woke crowd pushed me over the edge. just wanted to add to the sale numbers as a big fu to the woke crowd. Im also a trans women  fuck the wokies.also even though I was disappointed with cyberpunk  I still put in like 130hrs and 100  the game despite the jank. the game at its core was good  and still enjoyed it.  would ve been even better polished but w.e  I think hpl will also be good even if its a bit glitchy.  so Im not to worried.
you quit too one too early. itstarts to get real as the cast get older.
the harry potter movies get better as they go along. I wasn t terribly impressed with the first few movies  but I kept watching  and they got much better. the movies get darker and more mature.
@gabriel  not as dark as the novels. the film versions were a bit tame for me. I would have loved if the producers and directors did the fight between bellatrix and mrs. weasley justice on the last part of deathy hallows. my very reason to preorder is the same reason I support johnny depp despite his choice in women like amber heard. this issue itself is far larger than this game and jk rowling as much as it was far larger than johnny depp and his flaws. you dont tell people what they can enjoy on their own time. none of your business.and folks already had lost their jobs over just liking this game.
same.I do not preorder  no matter what.but I did it this time just to make my little statement  and knowing I ll play the game anyway
yup I too bought an only ever watched 1st movie
@deth incarnate  it already went gold for pc months ago. it will be ready in feb
I just replayed banjo-kazooie as a 33 year old. it made me so freaking happy.
@person reanimation  one of the best nintendo games of all time. I played it more than 1000 times as a kid.
windwaker and metroid prime on gamecube. up to that point I d only played nes games and pokemon... maybe oracle of seasons ages for gbc.
final fantasy 8 was my first rpg  it was amazing
@jokerfox  I was about to say ff7.
oot and ff10 are up there the first couple pokemon games as a kid as well
mass effect 1 gave me a similar feeling. the whole trilogy was great  but that first game had that magic.
everquest I and morrowind--my first open world rpgs. morrowind  in particular  was the first time I was exposed to the joy of exploration music  finding things I wasn t looking for  and the excitement you get from a monster-spawning system that feels unpredictable--knoeing you could be attacked on a road you ve traveled dozens of times in the past.
conkers bad fur day
oblivion on 360
same - 33 here. cautiously optimistic about the game  will wait until its out and see what the general reception is. done preordering games.

if there s any shenanigans thats why patches exist ala no mans sky and cyberpunk 2077
@kurgan  both unfinished games sent out early to make deadlines. cyberpunk 2077 was unplayable for many causing refunds.  its fine now but it was clearly not finished.  warhammer 40k darktide is currently in thatsituation.  say what you want about the callisto protocol  it had a horrible launch because of early release as well.
@kurgan  like going to a restraunt and paying for dinner and then getting to eat it a year later. last game this developer made was cars 3 in 2017 that came out on the playstation 3 so yes there s concerning signs. hopefully it turns out good though
@kurgan0822  @kurgan   hold up
if youre not a big harry potter fan  I wouldn t recommend you getting the game because youre not gonna know what s going on or what the easter eggs mean but its up to you lol
@deadlybeast205  well my brother in law and nephew are into itso I ll probably pick it up eventually. still looks like fun though.
@kurgan0822  I respect that. hope you enjoy the game
@kurgan0822  its not based on an existing plotline so you will be going into this fresh like the rest of us hp fans  however from a lore standpoint hp fans will understand things better then you like the termology used and the kinds of creatures you will encounter.

they re not smart enough to realize that they are boosting sales lol
I visualize emperor palpatine s   yes  yes!! let the hate flow through you!  when the wokistanis bigotry backfires on them.
I got my preorder in. I am a big hp fan though.
I have a theory warner bros is paying people to say things like  dont buy the game muh transphobia  because they know it ll create a streisand effect and boost sales
@mr mistah  I was thinking that too it makes sense cuz if they know they re boosting sales wouldn t sjws have stopped  unless they re just not smart enough to put 2 an 2 together
totally get it  I watched everything but the last two of the fantastic beast because they were all going to the woke crap. also  I disliked the plots for fantastic beast too. seriously out of all the ways to plot a movie with the title fantastic beasts and where to find them  they chose that  but anyway  I cant get the game right now which sucks but its on my wishlist. the harry potter games have always been really spectacular. I think they get underrated and poeple forget they exist. even the very first one with terrible early 2000 and late 90s graphics was fun and great for its time.
I just watched the gameplay showcase yesterday and honestly the game looks fantastic.I hope the story is equally as good as the gameplay and I hope the game runs well at launch.because it overall looks very promising. but we shall see
Im not a hp fan but the game looks interesting enough just to check out the worldscape they have created.  some of the details look really good and clearly some people on the design team have a passion for the ip.    I wont pre-order but it certainly goes on my wait for sale list.
I hope it is actually a good game  otherwise all these preorders and wishlists will severly hurt it. when you have this many pre orders you better hope to hell your launch goes well  because if it doesnt you are boned.
I did pre-order harry potter  I really liked the movies.  and being able to be a wizard and cast stuff in something that looks so good.   Imissed out in buying the collectors with the book and floating wand.  so thatshould say the fan I am on this series
also  sophia pointed out some tweets by kotaku and ign staffers that are  disappointed  in melonie. why  because she s outspoken and honest and you aren t !
just pre-ordered the deluxe edition on steam even though I never got into harry potter growing up I think its important to at least show support to the devs for not backing down and stick it to the the mob
never cared one bit about harry potter or any of thatstuff before but when I saw the gameplay in august last year  I thought it looked fantastic. the world and seasons  as well as the collage itself give me a strong vibe of fable mixed with canis canim edit  Im willing to take a risk and pre order on this one. the crying blue hairs haven t factored into my decision making  but damn is it not a nice little bonus though
hate boner  is my word of the day!! thanks mel
thank you!!! this is so refreshing to hear. Im a Christian and we gotta follow the Bible and Christ s teachings. love your work thanks for speaking truth.
this is making me even more excited to play the game
I preordered back in september. I honestly wasn t even aware of the controversy until about a month ago. makes no difference to me  the blue haired twitter mob wont keep me from going to hogwarts to learn wizardry.
hImelonie! new viewer and subscriber here. I bought hogwarts legacy because I was a fan and read the books when I was young and watched the movies. I also stream on twitch  Im not a big streamer though its more an off work hobby . then I started hearing all the none sense about it and I then bought it for my older sister who is also a big harry potter fan and she was ecstatic! anyways tldr I bought it for myself personally as a fan and to make the reee s be heard. game is looking great even though the non binary crap isn t that cool.
Ive been a fan of rowling s wizarding world for years and its every harry potter fan s dream to live out their own legacy within that world. hogwarts legacy promises to deliver precisely that experience. the game is being made by fans for fans  because they know exactly what we ve been wanting as they ve wanted it too. the fact that its success drives the wokies to unhinged levels of insanity is the cherry on top and a nice side effect  but I bought this game because I am first and foremost a potter fan and a gamer  and this looks to deliver the perfect marriage of those two things.
you ve mentioned before the whole cutscene thing. I haven t played a lot of games but I have played a few where I was just getting into the gameplay and getting hyped and then it would go to a cutscene. it annoyed the ever loving shit out of me how many cutscenes there were. Ive been playing ghosts of tsushima lately and Im still early in the game but this one so far seems to not overload you with the cutscenes  its a beautifully rendered game  and its challenging. Im playing the normal difficulty and have got my ass kicked in fights a lot.
I really like her take on the interactive cutscene vs actual video game. I feel like lego star wars the sky walker saga suffered from that a lot and Im glad Im not the only one who thought this way about games.
they managed to piss off both sides of the culture war. impressive stuff.
I love harry potter and wanted to get the game but  this makes me want it more. also  you made it onto brett cooper s show.
I enjoy your videos and admire the courage you have to stand by your belief.  I subscribed.  keep doing good works!!
I dont really preorder anymore lol its a bad habit that usually ends with youregretting giving them your money- imo. I will say that this game actually looks good. my biggest problem with the harry potter movies was just how much potential was wasted. this looks like it ll truly flesh out the world and if its worth the money  it ll end up on my wishlist.
I have just pr-ordered  I was unaware that the game existed until the controversy was highlighted by my favourite youtubers  talk about the streisand effect...  I personally am a big gamer and love open world rpgs and this game looks amazing.  I am a moderate harry potter fan so that is a bonus.  my wife is not a gamer at all but is a massive harry potter fan  she has been to the theme park in london many times  and as part of our honeymoon we went to universal s theme park!  and when I showed her the gameplay vids - she said  you need to get this so I can have a go playing it!   so I really hope the game is as good as itseems - as the only other game I have preordered was cyberpunk 2077 and was a little let down with the quality on release!
thanks melonie! done flooding your feed now.
why is kotaku even a thing anymore
@starsiegeplayer  they have been through 2-3 mass fireings and new management and they still lose support. I doubt they be along for the ride in 5-6 years time  ign eurogamer  pc gamer etc might be as they still have some audience and actually have good things in between.vice and a fe wmor eoutlets used to have gamer departments not anymore.
exactly lok
I preordered hogwarts legacy because Ive been a fan of harry potter since I was in middle school back in 2011. Ive wanted to a harry potter game like this for so long. ps Im a Christian as well and agree with every word you ve said.
I cant afford buying it on full price so I have to wait for a sale. but I am 1000  sure I will buy it. potter rules
Imiss the verses you used to have at the end of every video but I appreciate that you keep standing up for your faith. God bless you melonie!
Im definitely playing this  genocide simulator    always keep being yourself melonie. thats what makes a person really awesome and standing out from everyone else. unlike the woke  they dont even know who they are.
support this channel and melonie mac. and  hail to the fellowship!
thank you for talking about the things that you do on your channel for my Christians perspective. God bless you and your family and friends. duane.
I reckon a lot of people would love to watch you play through the game. me included. ever thought about doing a play through
I pre ordered when it first went on sale on steam. have been counting down the days til its release. I listen to no one when it comes to the harry potter franchise. long time fan  _
seeing your tweet got me curious about the game and after seeing some of the gameplay videos available  I just had to get it. I know nothing of harry potter  have never seen the movies  never read the books. but the reality is that the game looks good and is promising that it will be entertaining. piss!ng off the wokies is just the cherry on top.
hp is un-cancelable. the fan base is absolutely massive and extremely passionate. if you go up against the hp fan base you ll lose every single time.
honestly I was going to get this game regardless because good open world games are really hard to come by these days. but it was the developers of this game during the gameplay showcases that got me to pre order. you cantell they are passionate about this project and to some of us that actually matters.
hope to see you play the game yourself  Imyself hyped for it!
glad I found your channel  melonie   . I appreciate your honest view points as a trans individual.. sometimes its literally not that deep. people just take things too far.
Im an handsome 40 year old that has played games since I was 15 and not once did I ever buy a game because of the developers team or publishers political opinions  but because the game had three things I looked for good looking graphics with attractive characters  a great story where the characters evolved mentally and emotionally  and button mechanics on how flued the combat was and how easy it was to get to multiple buttons at once. these are the things that use to matter before movies and video games became a political outlet.
hogwarts legacy will definitely give a nice picture of the status of today s  culture war . I ll be grabbing a bowl of popcorn and watching with a grin from the sidelines.
keep these vlogs going melonie! thank you for these.
I really love your stance on everything you discuss. youre a lovely woman and I hope you never let those asshats get to you! keep up the great work. God bless!
I think hogwarts is doing really well in pre-orders because the game looks amazing. there might be a super small percentage of people who are hate buying it due to the activists  but for the most part  it just looks really good.
cannot wait to play this game  looks great.
please keep up with this story!
thank you so much!
hI curtis   handsome 40 year old.
who self proclaims they re handsome  thats in the eye of the beholder lol.
@thegood360  and if women tell u u are. then it probably means u are.
yeah you arent handsome. sorry someone told that to you as a joke bud  hope you get better soon.
@blox117   first of all I dont need anyone to tell me that Im attractive for my age. secondly Im good looking for my age because Im not 20 anymore so Im not going to have a chiseled jawline and other things that most people have when their young but Im not going to fear aging and embrace it  and I also dont have a deform face with any fascial fractures out of place. thirdly I chose handsome because I have seen way worst then me at my age and 40 years is a long time so I was using handsome and my age as a way to illustrate just how drastic the change has been from what developers use to focus on when crating video games  but like the idiot you completely are using handsome for more then one purpose eluded you because one word is the only the you can use.
@curtis willet  first of all  if no one tells you it  its probably because it isnt true.
not a big potter fan  just watched the first movie  and maybe the second  wasn t my thing really.  really looking forward to hogwarts  looks like a solid game  and a more digestible way to enjoy harry potter in my opinion.
not even a potter fan  but the game actually looks fun so I ll probably pick it up not long after release once I see if it lives up to the expectations even a little
I am beyond excited for this game! they care about the players and the hp fans! the real ones not the activist ones
would love to see you stream the game when it comes out
Im a huge harry potter fan  the game looks incredible  and it definitely doesnt hurt to give the middle finger to the moral busybodies.
I dont even understand how jk is transphobic. she just wants women to be safe and included in this conversation.
Ive got my copy pre-ordered. I love the harry potter books  the universe is very interesting  and I sincerely hope the game is fun and we ll made. the fact that I know it would infuriate the npcs that despise and revile whoever they re told to  that just makes the game a little more appealing to me. maybe I ll make some videos of me playing  my channel s basically dead and never gonna grow  so what have I got to lose  worst that could happen is my channel continues to not grow.
based  brave  badass  and bold. very well done.
I got this game so I could explore more of hogwarts not just the bad parts
Ive never read or watched harry potter. I watched the phenomenon unfold  but I was too busy to care.I am interested in the game  though. it just looks like it will be fun.the reeeee that accompanies it has cemented my opinion.
not a huge fan of harry potter but Im not skipping this game.  you speak well on these subjects.
Im not a harry poppins fan either  but this game looks amazing  the poppins world seems wicked interesting and I cannot wait to become a harry potter fan in the next few months.
great news. the people I feel sorry for are streamers that just want to play a video game and will get harassed. Ive seen a few posts from some of these weirdo s trying to organize mobs to flood channels. wether it actually happens remains to be seen  these people normally couldn t organize a prayer in a church.
I just watched the gamestar overview of the game. it really looks amazing.
I just started watching videos about the game and am interested. watched the movies finally last year. not a huge fan  but liked them. I am deciding between this and the new star wars survivor. this game pissing off the woke mob pushes me towards this one. I ll get both eventually.
this game is blowin up!!!
this looks like a game I would like.  it is in 3rd person  open-world  and it is rated m.  but I will wait for reports they have worked out all the bugs.  it is a safe bet these days it will have them.  it looks like it will have an uncapped frame rate for the pc so I ll get the pc version.
pre-ordered it long ago. imma be a chad slavic ravenclaw.
I hope the game is as amazing as it looks but even if its only half as amazing I think it would be a good game
did I purchase the game because I want to own the woke people  yes. did I purchase the game because it looks good  yes. did I purchase the game because I love harry potter and I want to be a Goddamn wizard  yes! three birds  one stone. no regrets.
they did pretty decent organizing riots across the country a couple of years ago. never underestimate your enemies.
hImelonie I hope your doingwell when u aren t infront of your camera.thanks always bringing these topics most others dont cover.takecare melonie
been a fan of the hp universe since the I read the first book  and I am really excited for this game  because it looks like it could be tons of fun and it looks stunning. moral busybodies and smear merchants trying to tell me what I can and cant play can piss off.
dynamic combat  hell yeah  !!mechanicaly its the same as just pointing the wand in a desired direction visualy those animations make the game drasticaly more interesting to actualy play
hopefully hogwarts legacy does great to stick it to the morons.  the kindest word I canthink of.  also the game looks fantastic and Ive been waiting for this for 20 years.
I probably shouldn t get hogwarts legacy because I got abundance of games and trying to cut back. but I want this more now just because of the controversy around it. Imean the publishers dont really deserve it because they catered to that crowd already but the hate is ridiculous and I feel it will only get bigger as we get closer to february 10th
Ive put the game on my wishlist on steam because I am waiting for denuvo and or easy anti-cheat confirmation. that being said  I did pre-ordered on xbox store. and yes  Imight just buy it twice
I remember having a lot of fun with the ps1 games even though Im not a big fan of the franchise. also som pc stuff back in the day was great too so why not try this one
damn  I get panic attacks a few times a year for no reason. I just wake up with them. I end up feeling miserable for a few days after them  so the last thing I d want to do after having one  is to bully someone for wanting to play x game. I avoid everybody  and chill for the next few days. but  I guess everybody is different. lol
the more you tell people not to do something... the more they want to do it.
its amazing when the woke left tries to control and destroy something and fails miserably. anyways you look amazing melonie. hope your day goes well. cant wait to to see that live with carmaxlla!
not the biggest fan  of the movies and never read the books. only a few years ago seen the movies and haven t actually watched them again. but I like the idea of it and have played games related and would probably read the books ... but the game I wanted already. once I heard about all this  Imade sure to pre order instead of waiting for the game to be cheaper later. but I was a bit late lol only the standard was available anymore.
Im pretty meh on hp but I do have fond memories of playing the sorcerers stone on pc back in the early 2000s so I hope this game gives me that nostalgia
dude I just found out sydnee goodman got divorced recently. I am seriously worried for relationships but with everyone being crazy in the head something bound to give. I like sat down for 30mins thinking about what is going on in the world. I by no means think miss goodman is crazy I just think most people are. miss goodman is an awesome lady but cant really be for sure when we see most of the surface. things are definitely not forever any more.
from up to 00 43 you ve hit the nail on the coffin. I haven t seen a single player rpg get this much love from their own developers in such a well written world. I believe the last time we ve been treated this well was the release of the witcher 3. the woke  however  they re just miserable and are a dying breed of dogs.
I preordered bc Im a life-long fan. I remember making my grandma watch the first 2 movies over a decade ago to prove to her it wasn t teaching me witchcraft and that I still loved Jesus. lol
trans-trenders  -- did you invent this phrase   it fits.  the game seems to be drawing on the success of zelda botw 14 15 on my fav parts of the video.  God making a cameo    thanks for the video!
I got hogwarts legacy because growing up I never had the money to get much involved in the harry potter world though I loved it I got to watch it at friends houses and seen them play the games and always wanted to myself and it was the same for me as it was for 3 of my friends so I bought me and my 3 friends the deluxe edition I dont care about those woke idiots who wake up every day thinking what can Imake offend me today and how can I destroy it for everyone else I got it because I want it and could never do it during my childhood
its hard to find a good Christian to listen to about gaming news.  its nice to hear a a perspective from the Bible instead of social media.  thank you
its funny that on twitter they cant even provide receipts to jk s supposedly transphobic rants. they just tell you to look they re everywhere.such sad people
not a huge harry potter fan but this game does look very impressive and Im going to give it a go. other peoples triggers are not my responsibility nor problem.
it has denuvo. it became no buy on pc.
bless you. hope you heal. those attacks will get less severe in time. learn to embrace them like lying on the water if you thrash around you sink. lie back and float with it. it ll get easier.
whoops 14 35 with that meme
I not a fan of harry potter   I only saw the first movie. but I have this game on wishlist on my steam account. and I hope it also work on my steam deck too.
the more reason for me to buy it
something to keep in mind y all. this game  despite the backlash from the alphabet mafia will absolutely fund their future woke campaigns  bc even tho jk wasn t directly involved  the ppl who made this  majority of them are no doubt married to woke ideals. so celebrate this win whilst we can  the war hasn t even begun.
I have not preordered yet  but I will.  I need it for the switch and that wont be coming out until july. Ive seen all the movies and read the books.  I d say Im a fan of harry potter  but not a super fan. I love open world games. Ive been playing zelda breath of the wild for a few months now and I love it.  I have witcher 3 queued up. Im excited about the sequel to botw.  the funny thing is  Imay have not even know this game was coming out until all the boycott stuff started to come out.  but I agree  it looks amazing and I will be preording it.
I like your channel. do you stream gameplay too or just general talk  I think you d be fun to watch.
recently getting into harry potter but as a big fan of tolkien   grrm I will give this game a chance not a big harry potter fan I got into the films and the games but getting into jk rollings is books.
ignorance and kotaku being mad at you is like my cat being mad at the neighbor down the street. they dont even care about my cat or even acknowledge his existence. they dont matter anymore. and they know it.
I pre-ordered the game because it looks incredible and Im fascinated by the harry potter universe. pissing off these woke cultists is just icing on the cake.
I  bought  hogwarts legacy. - I actually didn t  someone bought it for me for Christmas. I asked for it on Christmas  tho  because a  spite drives a lot of the things that I do  lol. if I know something stupid is going to upset people  that they shouldn t be upset over anyways. Im going to do it. b  yeah. it looks fun.
1 day I can play hogwarts legacy  but first I need to re-buy  re-collect     start reconstructing what its lost
Ive been considering updating my console in the near future. if I do this game is going to be on my short list.
I was never a big hp fan but I will probably play this because it looks like its gonna be a good game and Im a big gamer.
just got my order in for the collectors edition  just take my money as long as I can fly around on my broom
I wanted to play this game  so I bought it on ps5. then crazy nut jobs would not shut up  so now I bought it on steam too.
the character creation hinting at transgenderism reminds me of how I saw cyberpunk 2077. the option s there  but I went my own way in creating v how I saw fit. doing the same with hogwart s legacy. plus  the game s by the folks who made mad max  which I loved!
I never been so motivated to buy a game out of spite.
you go girl!
you should do a play through or atleast a review.
I pre-ordered it for two reasons. it looks amazing and it ll piss off the weirdos
acting  in good faith  doesnt apply to people without one...
the books are better btw  considered to be some of the best books in fiction.
first video of yours Ive watched. I laughed out loud multiple times so I ll be back for more.
I think its kinda silly to dismiss everyone who likes a good story in games as woke non-gamers. Im a gamer who likes a challenge  like elden ring   but I also like games with a good story thats more linear. Im anti-woke if anything  and you can call story driven games movies if you d like  but I like movies with good stories as well. if that can be combined with gaming  I ll like that too...edit  if youre wondering if I actually like a challenge  I can say Ive finished all the fromsoftware games except demon souls and bloodborn. not saying this to brag  just in case someone was thinking about accusing me of wanting easy games...
so  I hope this is a big turn around for games  Im a bit tired of games coming out where they are pretty much just cut scenes like your watching a movie  that game the quarry mad me mad when they released that. because it wasnt even a game. but I hope we start seeing more games with actual game play again. I have to hand it to nintendo for sticking to the old method of things  and sticking to originality with games  and not making games with a whole bunch of cut scenes. but as for me I didnt not pre order this. not sure if I am going to play it  Im waiting on the cyberpunk dlc and legend of zelda tears of the kingdom
we need more girls like you!
this is huge. and awesome. hogwarts legacy goty.  Imight have to day 1 buy it. for the win win
hey  you went with the tifa lockhart look today       so Im gonna have ask the question....  what house are you in the magical world of harry potter me  I am house harkonnen!  I aspire to be a floating fat man some day chilling out with family  raiding other houses  stealing golden thrones xd
just goes to show you how little power these so called activists have over the gamers minds. never let anyone tell you what you cant or can play. these people want to take away your free will.
I wonder how melonie feels about jrpgs  I think she might enjoy them.
I am definitely picking this game up but it will not be on launch day unfortunately because I am broke after waisting my money during Christmas
Im waiting for the game to come out before I buy it cause I think this whole thing is a reverse psychology im waiting for the review
game looks fantastic  the salt is a lovely perk tho
its succeeding because of the cancel mob.
what I find equally perplexing and funny in all this  is early on I saw the trailer and was as other amazed. then I looked up the developers with their release history  and I expected a flop while just keeping ears open in case its a quality game. looking forward to be proven wrong. - then suddenly people are talking politics and what not  instead of talking gameplay.. Im like  what !
it was obvious this  boycott  wasn t going to do anything  her last book was  boycotted  and it was still a best seller.
I only buy computer games that tell a story  look great  and captures my interest. I saw one game that provided a rare demo and the first five minutes was nothing but videos. needless to say I didn t  get the game. as to hogwarts....unless it is a game that really fires me up I dont get preorder. too many problems to count doing that. but early access    well I ll tell you this  once ultimate hunting comes out in early access on steam I will be one of the first people to grab it. even if I have to let my fianc  go to bed alone so that I am at the midnight release of it.
melonie will you do a review video or first impressions of the game when you finally get it
I ordered the deluxe edition for ps5.  I actually bought a ps5 just to get this game in february vs april on the ps4.  I have read all the books twice and own all of the movies so when I saw that this is an actual video game I couldn t wait to play it!!! when I found out all the wokies wanted to cancel it I was even further motivated to buy it. I will also be purchasing another ps5 deluxe edition for my son!!!
hate mob  jk rowling is a transphobe!me  what did she say hate mob   .. trust me. she is . hits block rather than defend a point with context
should we make a summary of the story of the game
I did pre-order  lol. partly because the game does look good  and partly to piss off the wokies. did the deluxe edition too. I keep hoping that games that dont give in to the activists and actually market to consumers will lead to more companies doing that. still waiting...
I love jrpgs  especially turn based and strategy
Im gonna be streaming it on twitch  will probably make a review video too!  d
@melonie mac go boom  ah cool I ll keep an eye out on twitch!my wife and I have been rewatching the films recently and they re so much better than I remember. as a result Ive become more interested in this game - I ll look forward to getting a preview on your stream!
truth. I still haven t seen what her supposed transgression was. the closest I got was a quote thatsaid cis women are different from trans women which is bot factual and acknowledges trans.
this just shows how much these people truly are the  vocal minority .
hogwarts legacy wasn t even on my radar....but after the fuss of the woke wackos I checked the game out and wow.... looks so good that I pre-ordered it!!!!! saw the movies and now cant wait to play the game..... thanks woke nut jobs for making me of aware of this amazing looking game.....lol
Imight buy when it is on sale. now Im too busy struggling with ck3.
hImelonie  good video if you like comics and good fantasy you should elfquest its really good
my 3 reasons why I pre-ordered was because reason 1 I love the the harry potter universe and always wanted to be a student at hogwarts and be apart of that universe reason 2 the game looks amazing it  actually looks like a game and not an  interactive movie reason 3 just to piss off and own the wokies  honestly makes me laugh that they just cant see that the more they cry  bitch and moan is just incrising the sales off this game at this point its just free advertising for the game cant wait for this game to come out the meltdowns will be amazing anyway stay strong and keep fighting
very few women out here with this thought process. love to see it
offtopic  she looks awesome in that!also wish people would leave games alone  it was one of the few things one could openly talk about before...but now...
carry on young warrior... that wwjd meme timing was devine !
can you imagine if hogwarts was created by ubisoft or ea lol. no way it would be even half good.
did they not learn from the books they read that light shines brighter than darkness snd utter spite helps as well
Im going to pre-order it when the reviews come out positive  and its good quality. Ive been wanting to play this for so long  fuck all that cancel culture shit
buying 2 copies of hogwarts on launch day
I was already planning on buying this when it came out. even maybe once it went on sale. but once all the stories about idiots the woke mob  trying to cancel it  I preordered the deluxe version for my ps5.
I honestly think regular people have began to wake up to the fact everything woke is crap and anything the woke hate is fun and entertaining
Im not going to pre-order. learned my lesson  with skyrim and halo.
Imight buy the game for the hell of it.
preordered it  I usually dont preorder. I was worried that I would no be able to find it in the stores.
looks nice   I am going to buy it. not pre order though.
been a harry potter fan for years and  this game sounds awesome lol so that is why I am getting the game. the shitshow around this game is hilarious  sjws are out numbered by us crazy potter heads almost feel sorry for them.
Im almost ready to just buy the game to shove it to the cancel mob. I wont ever play it but I want to take it to them.
its a sad lesson to have to learn  rip og gaming.
what lesson   why
@aya wetts  never pre-order anything.
@lonewolf031  why though   I can understand if its some bad pre-order terms like.. you are stuck with it no matter what even if it never comes out...  not all stores are like that.  steam pre-order you can refund at any time.  you can also refund after the game is released as long as you ve played less than 2 hours.
the world doesnt revolve around the trans
melonie   hmm....sweatshirt or tank top  flips coinlands on edgesigh  okay  both....
I am a big harry potter fan and a gamer and the game looks amazing. I pre-ordered the deluxe edition the day that it was available. Ive been following this game for years. there are thing that jk rowling has said that I dont agree with. the transgender statement isn t one of them  I totally agree with that. I dont have to see eye to eye  on everything  with someone to be friends or appreciate their work.
I am one of those that want to buy it because of the cancelation attempt  I dont like hp  but I want to stick it to the mob! lol
im really looking forward to this this game  . looks amazing  -
preordered my copy a bit ago. looks like a fun game. cheers
leaving the first comment...maybe...hey melonie
not seen any of the films or read one of the books its not my kind of thing but I do  enjoy the utter sxxxshow of the actavists going more insane then usual plus it generates great content from my favourite you tubers so yay winning
oh wow! it does look like a game with actual gameplay content! imagine that!
what s crazy I read all of what  jk rowling  actually said its alot or read but its not all that bad or hateful as they make it out to be
I asked the woke streamer saira you did a video on a few days ago if the authors of Lord of the rings and the witcher had said some racist shit back in the day that got revealed hypothetically  would she drop both series to see if there s any hypocrisy in her
I bought it cause it looks good and im a fan of harrypotter
first
you should try rewatching the film s melanie  they re great!
I hope this game is good!
why do I like harry potter all of a sudden
I dont preorder game  but if the game is good  I will buy for sure!
the game animation is better than marvel movies.   11 10
lol I bought the deluxe edition  been looking forward for this game since the first gameplay video
I pre ordered 3 times.    xbox series x  steam and ps5.      first time was because I love harry potter and Im really excited to have a large free roam rpg set in the universe.     the other 2 times was to stick the middle finger to the woke brigade.
hooray!!!
not a hp fan but I bet miss panama paper  emma watson  is screaming in anger at hogwarts success.
the game does look great  dang it.  I cant play it  but I wish I could...
I literally bought it an hour ago  only to realize I put in my billing address incorrectly t-t
honestly I dont care about politics or what jk said or what some people feel or their agendas. I just want to play a good game man...
thank you for speaking up!
I love harry potter always have and that is why I want to get the game
5 41 look at this  you can fight trolls...guyladriel   wasn t an ice troll  was it   I killed an ice troll in under 10 seconds on my own.  so  maybe you want a bit of the old ice troll treatment.
I bought the deluxe edition  all of the above for me
I still like some of rowling s stuff. I am looking forward to the game. next month  baby!
j.k. rowling started out with nothing.  just through her own creativity and perseverance  she earned fame and fortune by creating well-written  wholesome stories that whole families can enjoy.  she has brought happiness to millions of people. I have to respect her for that.  what have the woke crybabies done to make the world a better place
the game looks to be like the  skyrim  of the 2020 s. it does look interesting.
I pre-ordered hogwarts legacy at the end of last year. I am a fan of the harry potter universe and I love rpg games and hogwarts legacy looks great. while I have always played games for enjoyment  they are the one thing thatsaved my life. I needed an escape from the realities of the world so I could cope with the loss of family of the years. so  to see the game industry end up like this is very sad and disheartening. it proves that the woke leftists do not care for anything or anyone if they disagree with their agenda.
I think the reason on why its doing so well is all the reasons you stated plus what other games are classified as a genocide simulator!
I just hope the game doesnt suck.
its because of them I want to play this game. that and Im a big nerd  and miss a playing a good game.
they ve really been coming for you this past week...but youre not backing down!
I preordered the game in november before all the drama started because I love the wizardly world of hogwarts but now getting the woke haters mad makes my decision even better
I usually do not preorder games  cause lets face..  its usually not a good idea.... but I had to preorder hogwarts legaccy just becasue of the twitter mob... im like  a little kid I know  d
there the dursley family throwing harry s hogwarts letter in the fire they dont want u to have fun at hogwarts they want u to be miserable like them
Im really excited about this game  looks sick compared to the first trailers. lokI gave me more respect for magic user type characters  cant wait to be able to live that out in a quality fantasy world.
the harry potter books are phenomenal
@mr mxyzptlk  I read the first two when I was a kid. was good  but there are better writers than her  imho.
@the magus  ok  you canthink that. your bias aside shes considered one of the best authors alongside tolkien. all Im saying.
their rage only fuels me  I dont back down haha!
why is it not a good idea   steam lets yourefund anything you buy within 2 weeks and less than 2 hours played.  on pre-orders the 2 week timer starts on release date  not order date.  so I preorder  and if I play the game an hour or so and dont like it  I just get all my money back... easy.
sounds crazy but Ive never seen any of the harry potter movies or read any of the books. I got hyped for this game when I saw this video https   youtu.be 9lhns-ctc7a. like you said  big beautiful open world  lots to do and explore  and from the video there seems to be some kind of fallout 4 like base building or player housing mechanic which I love  so sign me up.
well joe brandon is walking among us so we know pure evil definitely exists
got my series x deluxe version ready to go.
they expression  money talks  is a rule anyone or any company should follow. I dont even like harry potter and I ll probably buy the game and play it on playstation just to make a point. it does look cool and the more people complain about it the more I want to play it.
just put my pre-order down for the deluxe edition!
pre ordered the collectors edition for the wand and extra content  dont care about the alphabet mafia and their bs they are losing their battles on every front as they should we cant back down ever no matter the cost
kind of like harry potter  not any type of huge fan  but its ok... but the game looks fun  so I preordered it.  hoping it ll run good on my steam deck.
imagine me not becoming a wizard because someone adults are throwing a tantrum! couldn t be me!
hides his dungeon keeper and overLord boxesyes  us gamers are never evil.  d
5 41  you can fight trolls  ... internet simulator 2023
this actually does look really good
eldin ring was baddass. great game.
not a fan of potter but I brought it tho coz it looks great ..
yeah  Ive no especial attachment to harry potter - I thought some of the movies were decent - but the game looks enticing.  I order nothing until it launches and I can hear from reviewers I trust  but this is definitely a title I have my eye on.
Im going to buy the game for all those intro reason
Im a total normie but considering buying this cuz the trailer looked so good!
the only thing I dont like is that people are pre-ordering it. even though trailers look good I wouldn t do it. well unless I would be streamer reviewer as in that case it is your job to do review etc.
hogwarts legacy is nothing new  since we fight trolls each day  and everyone s in high school.    r.g.
for me Im in the category of spitting in the woke crowds face. I bought cyberpunk 2077 for the same reason so that business tactic is working on me. I still have a backlog of games and would have held off on buying. I really wish the dev thatstepped down wouldn t have caved in to them but what can you do. just like mel I bought the collectors edition. the game looks okay but Im no potter fan Im too old.
if melonie spelled her name melanie she wouldn t be the same person.
I am glad you are a woman of faith  melanie. I know I have made some posts in the past that   while agreeing with you   were pretty brazen toward the npc ilk in question  and for that   I apologize.  I ll try   in the future   to be more mindful and be a bit more diplomatic in my views. God bless.
my wife usually just wants the normal game  but just cause of the lefty s I bought her the mega delux edition
good video melonie im sad I did not get featured because of that  person calling me a bigot yesterday for asking a question but still enjoyed the video
I hope corporations finally start to understand that loud twitter people only make up a micro-fraction of their consumer base.
maybe adam sessler can join john phipps in logging off  they could use time away from the platform and touching the green stuff!
absolutely the cancel mob needs to mind their own  thatsaid I dont think you should really take into account the story of who made the world of a game not even the actual game  when youre considering buying it. how many people play those cheap phone games and watch ads on them thatsupport people they have no idea what they support. in the end the point of playing games is enjoyment and if its a game you can enjoy  play it.
my wife s boyfriend-jamarcus said Im allowed to spend my starwars  funko pop money on on hogwarts legacy but my non-gendee-specific non-birthing parent said no.
so one of my go to cosplays is newt scamander  does that make me just awful as someone who plans to buy hogwarts legacy
well for me I enjoy watching the harry potter movies. melonie you look so good in the video
I really really want to drop 70  to own the woke lol. though to be fair  I wanted to buy the game just to spite the woke because I hate them with everything I am however  once doing research into the game. its looking gooood!
thanks! I want to pre order it this weekend  but all I got is ps4 I have to ask my brother who s 14 years younger how  I hate that Im not a gamer anymore the last game I played was destiny about 5 years ago. but I ll give this game a gI boom!!!
Im not really an harry potter fan  but Ive seen the movies and I really like the atmosphere  hl looks like will be very atmospheric and very interesting to play  I ll buy it because of that  and of course Im a very bad person according to the woke mob because of that  exactly like when I said I dislike the last of us 2
love your videos
this drives me up the wall.idiots   what!  a harry potter game is coming out!  j.k. rowling doesnt share my views! we have to devote our attention to make sure this sin doesnt get released!!! its evil! others   thanks for giving the game a larger profile. now can you shut up and let us play it  me   this is an industry where women are being sexually abused  employees being worked to the point of needing  therapy  some have commited suicide  and the workers who try to establish unions to defend themselves are being fought and fired and nobody cares because they want the newest  shinies toy that they ll forget about in a month! why are people caring about this when genuine evil is happening! !
Ive been excited since the first trailer. I dropped money for the deluxe edition and I will buy it for switch too.
I have been looking for a proper harry potter game for years and this just looks incredible and right up my alley. tbh  these woke activists need to get help because this sort of behaviour of forcing people to agree with their narrative is certainly not healthy. but ofc  in their minds its not them  its everyone else...
I pre ordered the deluxe edition yesterday I dont even care if the game sucks I just wanted to give them the middle finger lol
this was awesome!
yesss! go boom!
phipps again  good grief  is there anyone he s not tormenting these days  anyway  off to order hogwarts.
keep the faith come what may.
I am not a fan of harry potter even a little bit but avalanche studios has made some games I like in the past like just cause 3 and rage 2 but they ve also made some kinda bad games like just cause 4 and rage 2  so I ll be interested to see if this game is legitimately good or not. the outrage is ridiculous but will it be good.
I pre-ordered just to spite them. I planned on checking the reviews after release before deciding.
I do not pre order games anymore  not for any reason. though I have whish listed it   if it launches in a polished state  not a broken buggy mess like most games these days  ill be picking it up as it looks like a fun rpg.
I just argued with someone on twitter about this game because they told me its  real  witchcraft. long story short it ended with them telling me theres only 1 true religion so.
@melonie mac go boom is the shawn guy still giving problems  maybe video update on that.. also maybe a vid on the velma series
just discovered you a few days ago. keep putting God first while you live your life. you are a strong  vibrant  educated Christian. everything in this world can be fun but its all finite. God will reward you in the next life for defending his moral truth.and you can still enjoy the video game world.God bless
God not to be weird but melonie looks fucking adorable in the thumbnail uwu   dont worry mel  I wont drive thousands of miles to stalk you lol
everything in life loses energy and everything in life has diminishing returns.  cancel culture is not exempt from this law. its only a matter of time before they scream into a vacuum.
Im a trans women and bought the game early as a big fu to the wokies. all my other trans friends did the same  we aren t all woke. I love seeing the woke crowd die slowly  they need to stop speaking for me and other trans people.  big love for j.k ! all her concerns were valid. btw you nailed it melonie!! real trans women have a lot of empathy for biological women and do our best to not make them uncomfortable.
melonie. you haven t read the books  and I thought I liked you but now  who am I kidding I still like you!!.  never mind !!! lol keep doing what you are doing!!!
Im buying the deluxe edition of this game for pc and steamdeck for myself  Im buying it on switch later for the wokes
I just wanna play the game lol.
I dropped  80 on the deluxe edition just to own the woke lol I had no interest in this game until they started demanding people not buy it
hey next you need to go and get sorted into a house and wear your house colors on video. make these people cry mel. awesome video. I planned on holding off on getting the game due to money issues but now Im actually thinking of getting it money or not to get these morons to cry more. lol. keep the videos coming
upon release  Im going to spend whatever money is in my patreon on copies of the game and gift them to my friends and family. just to pI   off the wokies.
I love seeing the  get woke crowd  and soupy people  implode! they re the reason I started my netflix again when ricky gervais  special dropped. otherwise I wouldn t have heard about it for a while  so ty soupy people.
I hope the devs thank the cancel mob for free press..
I would have waited till it hit  40 on steam but to own the woke is worth an extra  30
thank you so much  _
@melonie mac go boom  no problem mel-senpaI  hope you are doing well! keep up the great work and thanks for the great content  listening to your vids on 3rd shift gets me thru a terrible night a lot! Godspeed
youre the first trans person Imet that I respect thanks
Imight just buy it to add to the anger of the activist and it looks cool
streisand effect. no  you shouldn t see this thing!everyone  oh  I gotta see this.
tbh I dont play games like that more into pvpve shooters. but me and 30 ppl preordered it... just for the heck of it   gonna leave great reviews
they keep on failing again   again   again   again   its 200  hilarious
lets gooooooooooooooooooooooo buying tf out of this awesome magic battle game. wokes  stop having funnnn reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
I was slightly interested in this game prior  but as soon as I found out the woketivists wanted to cancel it I preordered! xdI will absolutely refund if itsucks tho.
cancel mob   no  everyone else    cancel mob doesnt matter.
it looks like a blast.  I only buy a new game once a year  ill be buying this.  is it only on ps5
gamers will stomp out wokeness every time!
there isnt enough offended  krunts   its gonna sell and its gonna sell big and it makes me happy
I dont usually pre order games  I usually wait till their like 50  off.. Imade an exception for this  I pre ordered the deluxe addition. real gamers and hp fans dont care what weirdos think.
I got the deluxe edition for like  45 Im good
Im not a massive fan  my 16 year old daughter love s harry potter and tried to talk to me about it when she was 13  so I watched all the films several times so I could talk to and understand it. I have to admit I enjoy itso I ll be buying the game for both my own enjoyment and to stick it to this cancel culture rainbow thing.
for me its a little bit of it all. I like harry potter but wasnt that interested in this game but after seeing more of the game it became more interesting but may have bought it on a sale. after seeing the whole cancel culture thing I kinda now want to get it day one because cancel culture is stupid. it the equivalent of modern day witch hunts  if it wasnt a crime people definitely would be burning or drowning people alive over options sadly to say. luckily its not legal so they just throw tantrums instead like children.  game looks fun plus I like ravenclaw so ill be checking it out. plus is one of the few day on  60 games. im not all for  70 games
the fact that once the first gameplays appear on youtube the woke mob will be sucking their thumbs  crying  but still watching the gameplays. they want the game to fail not because of their ideals  but because they cant stand not playing the game because they cant disappoint their ideals. deep down  they are furious we are gonna have fun playing it while they will be depirved of having fun.
the fact that this game will have everything available dark magic  beasts and everything in between except for quidditch which who tf cares is amazing and this is what we ve been wanting but because its fun and everyone likes it the transformers in disguise have to ruin everything
id like to live my wizardry life tyvm
to be honest iam definitely buying this game if we dont stand up now then gaming is dead forever
heliocentrism is the old school woke way to dismiss reality
its looks fun  open world  potentially get to be evil. fly around on buckbeak xp pick your house  heck ye
windows... xbox... ps... even supposed to be a switch port in a few months.
I wouldnt worry about phipps if I were you. any dude who knits his own beanie is not a threat lolol
dont buy that game! its offensive for many political reasons     buy that game! they actually focused on making it fun for a change.
Im torn on hogwarts legacy. on the one hand  I was only interested in the game through all the trailers and information around it. but now the woke mob hates it  so I feel almost obligated to play it lol but I still dont think its going to be that good.
this is like reverse psychology marketingstill wont pre order  though
to be fair  they made the game sound awesome lol
hey melanie. just watched a couple of your videos and subscribed. I like your brains and speak. your my new favorite pretty. inside and out.
I am transsexual male to female and I have orderd it twice as every game so far! I collect games physicaly and I get them digital! I have now hogwarts legacy digital deluxe edition and the collectors edition with the book and and the wand is ordert to! so I am so hyped about this game. slytherin forever! what you said about religion  I dont get how people can beleave on such things. I am non religious. I am mor buddhist cause I am half japanese half german. wish you a good time anyway!
imagine pre ordering a aaa video game in 2023 for any reason.
the cancel mob are like dementors. repel them with positivity.
only question I have about hogwarts legacy is how they plan on making this shit run on my switch. if its cloud I gotta pass. Ive seen good big games work on it already though. it depends on whether or not the developer feels like being lazy. put in a bit more effort and sell a lot more copies.
for me it all three option you said at 0 43. you also have a point the last true rpg I have played  I haven t played elden ring  is dragon age inquisition. this game looks great rpg wise. most these days want to hold your hand cause the crybabies want someone holding their hand. those idiots need to play the original contra without the konamI code  or duck hunt. weak  idiotic.....
the troll at @5 46 looks uncannily similar to the one from fellowship of the ring.
because the cancel mob doesnt have more power than the power give give it. people must unite against it and I love the massive success hogwarts legacy is having. seeing people just going  I dont care about your whining  gives me hope to restore some sanity into society.
youre good people mel
I dont like being told how to think or what to consume by people who I will never meet in person.  the twitter idiots can kick rocks.
Im not jumping on the own the woke bandwagon  still waiting on first impressions and reviews  but glad about its success. game developers work so hard only for some wild narrative to wreck the sales of the product they worked on.
I probably never would have seen this game if they didn t have such a hardon for it.thanks to them  Im an extra preorder that wouldn t have existed.
Im interested in the game but I wait to see what the switch version will be from a gameplay persepective. I dont really care for the graphics. my first console was a nes so the core game was more important then graphics.
no. especially no to 70 dollars. Ive cut back on games quite a bit because I have kids.  I play lego or power rangers with my two boys and now a third on the the way.  so wont be able to play much. if the reviews are good I ll get it in a few years for 20 or 5 dollars.
now that the video is done  dont forget your water. just a friendly reminder.
certain companies are worth the trust. rockstar for example. gta 5 and rdr2 launched perfectly fine.
appreciate your support towards my channel 
the thing that Jesus talked about in the Bible that resonates with me now is his warning about these false prophets
ye I agree with you on the Christian thing
there are over a dozen people in my office that never heard of this game until all the boycotting. they all added the game to their wish list after looking at the videos about it. imagine how many other people in the world didnt know the game existed until this crap started. get woke  go broke.
screw the cancel mob  but practically nothing in that trailer you showed is gameplay. the actual gameplay looks a lot less good visually and as for the rest we ll have to see.
something I think is particularly interesting about the woke movement is that its actually united Christians  atheists  muslims  jews  hindus  etc  all in opposition against it xdparticularly in the nerd space and the parenting space
I actually pre-ordered it because of this. Im not even a big harry potter fan  but I am a fan of good games   I saw the meltdown from the leftist lunatics that I had to order it!!
just preordered my copy  funny story though   have a friends wife who was a huge harry potter fan  then jk rowling said shes a turf and now he the husband has to hide the fact hes buying the game from his wife......just wtf.
the entire franchise is peaked on this game and this game alone Im surprised quidditch didnt become an esport. but  alas the harry potter books are technically finished since half blood price which is practically philosophers stones descriptions of harry s past being relived like all of the series the things that happen in real time just delay the ultralistic depository that is harry s life personalized through the makeshift friendships he associates with. so the game is bolstered by a fan based that describes a hero who is determined to uncover truths basically nullifying based critique. such as someone who never even wanted to read a novel or is too preoccupied to enjoy a good book.
I bought six copies one for each of my niece and nephews lol just because
looks meh but Im gonna buy it lmao. God of war was peak and the cinematics were a beauty!!!
you yourself are very respectable melonie. you ve always fought the right fight  but I see quite a few simps that follow you lol thatseem to think youre the only one doing the work. oh well..
yes  I care more about my enjoyment of an imaginary world  much more than I care about your imaginary grievances.
its simple harry potter is a much loved  multi-billion dollar franchise of books and movies  and the haters are a small loud minority on twitter that the majority of fans have no  idea even exist !  Im not even a big harry potter fan but if you want to see how much harry potter is loved try going to universal studios and try to get on a harry potter ride if you have 4 hours spare to queue lol most fans have no idea of the garbage on twitter
I cant afford a ps5 but I have a series s and will play the game on it
dont know how to choose between starfield or hogwarts l.  I just hope these games live up to expectations  we ve been suffering too many years with crappy aaa games with zero substance
the crazy woke activist got people like me who dont like harry potter pre-ordering the deluxe edition Im admit the game looks good but also its despite those lunatics
if melonie mac showed me her harry potter I would definitely hogwash her legacy and go boom....
simple 2 words  streisand effect
Im a leftist but in the traditional sense that I want good and helpful change and I still wanna get this game.. it looks awesome asf and imma join slytherin!
the reason Im getting it is because it looks like a fucking rad game.
amen!
@melonie mac go boom  God bless you miss and may God bless you each day with clarity and wisdom
yup
1st day purchase for me
shoot  Im even here for the linear titles. I remember ninja gaiden  nes snes  1-3  mega man  nes  1-6  donkey kong country  snes  1-3  etc. I guess mega man has stages you could pick the order of  but those stages were kind of just complicated hallways  you know  the handholding s the problem for me. Im not tryna have my pok dex scream at me to go walk into a 45 minute silent cutscene every single route when Im rollin  through a pok mon game. lemme just get in there and find stuff  bruthur. God bless. deeply frustrating.
00 31 thats why I bought it
if the game is as good as the trailer looks no activist will be able to stop it.
cant wait to see the character creator and people abusing it. I want to be an arthritic 62 year old persian woman.
there malding  this brings me joy
I love the harry potter series and seeing new fantastic things about the game were high points for me in 2022  triggering the woke crowd is a plus.
next thing you know  these same people will be bullying players for not playing as poc.
the irony is that without them people would complain about the game being woke lol
was always gonna buy it cause I am a harry potter fan  angering the activists is a bonus
100  true
I saw all the movies and read the first book  was never really a fanatic. but I always thought that a game in the hp universe would be cool. so I will definitely be getting this. could care less what the woke idiots have to say.
I have some isue with jk. when it comes to her putting archetypes upon her character s for political clout  that was bot present from the start. dumbledors sexuality is hes gay now... why because activism. hope thisbhas been a lesson for her.but these devs are making a game people want. and being boycoted by wokism for jks  injustices   I feel suporting this game... that looks like the first non  movie game  harry potter game. itseems hopefuly good im woried it may be woke....however I hope a show of suport against the woke mob being not only viable but extremely successful may show investors that they are backing the wrong horse!
no example for the gaming industry will work  they know how destructive this woke clownery is but they just have to go along. thats why some devs do low effort job resulting in an end product thats shit. they have no passion as they know their freedom of expression is being limited.  wokeness is pretty much a mandate for most western games now  hogwards legacy included.
the ps5 pre order was because it looks like a phenomenal game  without having ever seen a harry potter movie or book read. the extra xbox pre order was because it felt like the right thing to do
how much of this cancel stuff is just twitter and youtube  anyways! this is a 1st day buy!
unsure of any of the woke part here  this game is going to sell well anyway.
based gamer girl strikes again. great vid!
2 reasons  1 the game looks amazing. 2 jkr did not say anything that is actually transphobic.
Im not at all a conservative and I want the game because Im a fan and yes Ive wanted this game for over a decade playing the gameboy advanced  ps2 and xbox games.. nothing will stop me from enjoying this dream come true of a game.
hey melonie! you look incredibly beautiful today. hope you have a wonderful day.
I watch your videos religiously
thought your tatoo was harry potter affiliated...
ok  at least you mentioned in the video the goofy gender character creation stuff. as an rpg in theory it looks like the strongest open world rpg since skyrim or the fallout series. I guess also kinda dragon age inquisition but its not open world in this same way of being truly open world.
im a fan of oblivion and bethesda refuses to release the next elder scrolls. so im gonna play hogwarts legacy and hopefully steal everything that isnt bolted down.
I just bought 3 pre-orders today for my nephews and I  suck itsjw s!!!!!
I dont think  walking simulator  means what you think it means. there are some fantastic walking simulators. two of my favorites are what remains of edith finch and beyond eyes. a aaa game that is full of cutscenes is not a walking simulator. Im not sure I would even count life  is strange or oxenfree as one.
I never preordered any game in my life untill now. woke mob pissesme off so much I decided to pre order this game just to help a little bit to piss them off
I have no issue with the whole gender thing in the video game as selecting your character as long as its not a political thing things that offer more freedom for character design and such is usually a awesome thing hopefully the game lives up to the hype the entertainment industry as a whole has just stagnated because of pc culture
despite cancel mob   itsucceeds because of cancel mob. I actually didn t plan to buy it but I decided to give it a try. if those nazis dont like it  it must be really good.
melonie looking so fine
Im not a harry potter fan either. but the game has my interest because what I am a huge fan of is open world rpg s. but these people who want to control all of us cant seem to understand that because they re probably not even really gamers. they probably only ever play games like candy crush.
I pre order it like 4 months ago  and I am just learning about lgbtq etc. which is dumb .like I just never met any of them in my life. so I dont care I love harry potter I bought the game thats it.dont laugh like I dont even know jk until like 2 months I watched movies when I was a kid  and reading books now  3 books finished
journos and activists seething upon realizing that their twitter power doesnt translate into rl.let them stay mad and keep rockin melonie.
just as its fine for me to love marion zimmer bradley s  the mist of avalon   my favorite tale within the arthurian legends  or marilyn manson s music  despite the allegations against them  the former of which I dont believe  nor do I personally care  as its got nothing to do with me or the books I read  unless they re manipulative and blatant as a lot of feminist woke books tend to be  its perfectly fine for one to purchase and enjoy playing games they like. hogwarts legacy is definitely no different.
lol  hate boner  love it!!
the funny thing is that the devs have tried to pander to these freaks  even on igns character creator trailer  they deliberately put the black guy with coloured hair on the thumbnail and yet they re still copping it. hopefully this a lesson to all companies to stop bending the knee to these people
I bought 5 copies of it
not only did I pre-order the deluxe version  I got another one for a friend as a Christmas gift. it looks good  it looks fun  it looks engaging  it looks like a game. a fact that has been lacking a lot in most releases the last decade from the big name producers. Ive bought more indie studio games the last several years then major releases then I have since I started buying games on my own for the last 30 years. while I have heard a bit about the  fan backlash  over the game   admittedly mostly from you as I generally dont bother to read look at news anymore  it really has no bearing to my choice to buy  I got it because it looks like a game I can enjoy several hours in.
I hope the game succeeds  because its a good game and not another derailed hype-train like cyberpunk2077 and battlefield2042. the  told-ya-so  crowd would have a field day.

dragon age is garbage now though because of that horrendous anime that you absolutely shouldn t watch
hogwart legacy is avalanche studio game  they made mortal kombat 11  best batman games  lego star wars   shadow of mordor war. so its big chance game will be good
its becoming a great way to promote just about anything. have a couple of idiot s come out against it and itsells like hot cakes. not a harry potter fan but might get it just cuz.
I suppose they have to do something with their sad miserable lives lol
Im irritated about the character creation system not having male or female pre-sets because regardless of what liberals say  men and women have distinct features outside sex organs and I can already see it being difficult to get what you want perfect. but hey  who knows  maybe they ll make it work  with that being my only complaint prior to the game s release  Im all on board for this game.
what happens if the game releases as a broken buggy mess just like 90  of the games in the past year  pre-ordering a game is a stupid move  I am waiting 1 month for reviews  potential fixes etc to buy it. I dont even like hairy pothead but I love playing great games.
I h8 wokeness so I will! buy hogwarts legacy     that will show them xd
Imean  harry potter has a huge fanbase  and the game looks very good too  so it helps  there is a lot of people that bought it because they like harry potter  others because the game looks nice  and others because they hate woke people  Im a bit of all  I bought it because I like harry potter  and because the game looks good  but bought the deluxe edition because of woke idiots.but if the game is good when it releases  this will be the most selled game of the year  maybe even the decade.
wizardry dreams here lol
I really wish politics would just stay out of the entertainment industry because movies and video games are a source of enjoyment and fun not meant to be a outlet to drone there consumers or non consumers with ideological opinions.
this is satisfying.
and steam is probably going to be the smaller platform of the initial launch.
youreally should read the books. they re 10 times better than the movies.
red haired wizard boy   dead wizard girl s brother thatdiedin episode1 of goblinslayer  from goblin slayer volume 6 is at the ready!!!!!
I disagree with rowling s political beliefs  but I enjoyed her novels. if we cancelled all authors because we disagreed with them  our libraries would look like ikeas thatsell shelves.
I love the movies  love gaming  Im going to play the game. I dont care that 1 person out of hundres of people that worked on the moves is a horrible person.
buy that game!! if its good tho
I love open world type games  I love the exploration. its  gameplay.  yea I like cinematics in games  but I value gameplay more. I pre-ordered it on ps5 awhile back. I dont care what that 1  of ppl that make up this population care.
I wishlisted it because I want to send a message to the industry.  we dont want woke.
I say let them hate  Im still getting the game period because Im a fan!
all the woke crying is what is making me purchase this game when it is released.
was not expecting to hear hate boner this morning ngl
fake contoversy aside the game looks really good  the in game graphics and game play demos I have seen look amazing.
woke hate is fuel for the ultimate power  the uncaring no u
they just want us to play woke vegetable based games instead of classic meat based entertainment
you can literally be trans in the game. you cant make them happy  they re the true problem  not jk. such little amount of things are going on in their life that they feel the grip of cancel culture  and it allows them to  have purpose . deep down you know damn well they have zero issues with it.
go boom!!!
I think its a bit of harry potter fans and genuine excitement. I dont want to think we re going so low as to play buying a game just to own the woke people
just pre ordered 2 copies for series x
it does actually look like a good game but Im dubious of wb games in general. I still want to get it to annoy the wokesters though
holy sh t  u are based.  im not being sarcastic here  u are one of real gamers who is just tired of this woke mess.
preorder sales! hogwarts legacy!
never seen or read a hp movie or book  but pre-ordered it. looks like a good game and I just couldn t resist sticking it to the wokes. I lean left by the way. not conservative at all.
Im gonna preorder hogwarts legacy just to flip a double bird to all the woke crowd because Im sick and tired of them telling me what to think or how I cantalk as far as I am concerned they go take a very long walk off a very short pier
I hope in the wake of this hogwarts cancel fail other game companies take note of just how small and inconsequential the woke mob is!!!!
gamers pretend to be bad in video games  no. I am bad in video games. especially when I use a cheat code. nobody judge me.
I love that melanie
I haven t pre-ordered a game in 8 years. I ll probably pre-order hl just to spite the sjws. it also looks dope.
nothing s more enjoyable than watching power hungry sociopaths failing at manipulating people...
if someone said to me   you care more about hogwarts legacy than the trans movement   I d say   yes  I do   with a big smile on my face.
Im torn on this. I get wanting to own the cancel brigade but the game and its developers are monstrously woke. there doesnt seem to be a winning move here.
how so  I know nothing about them.
its harry potter . its one of the most popular franchises. its an obvious money maker.
in character creation witch wizard is female male just fyi. the game does look good. Imight buy it even though I dislike rk s misandry. normal people can separate the artist from the art.
the age of the woke mob is done. people are getting sick of it and the tables are turning  although slowly. thanks to people like critical drinker  mauler  disparu  and of course melonie! woke culture is a trend and trends die.
I love how they conflate wanting to play a game with  not caring about them  and calling it hate or aggression. how are they not aware that one has nothing to do with the other  and of the fact that no one is obligated to care about transgender issues  I dont give a rat s ass about that crap  other than it pissing me off when use it to groom kids.
I feel like this is a lose-lose. sure  I d like to see the woke bullies take an l and cry crocodile tears  but at the same time rowling is still woke as hell  even if she s not quite willing to go full woke  and the developer of hogwarts legacy has been quite open about how  diverse and inclusive  the game is. so I feel like even if the game succeeds  its still going to be supporting people who I ideologically disagree with.thatsaid  I have to admit that the game looks crazy impressive.
melonie mac is based.
Imean 90  of those wishlisted aren t even gonna get the game  personally it looks like a good game but without co-op or online its gonna flop after a few weeks.
why cant they just take a break from grandstanding  and let people play the game. I chose not to buy the game because Im not a fan of harry potter  but being respectful towards fans is as simple as letting them enjoy their time geeking out.
for my part  I dont care about the debate. juste like more than half of the world ended not caring about the boycott of the world cup even though we were talking about actual human rights issues. some entertainments are more than just entertainment  people need them for comfort  especially in today s time  at the end of a world pandemic  the restart of the cold war  on the verge of a new world war  in the beginning the next economic crisis  and energy crisis  in the begging of the end of our biodiversity  end of our most important resources  in the beginning of the collapse  I do believe that there are more important fights today than boycotting a fucking video game. the said   woke   people against hogwart legacy dont care about the actual cause   they do that to validate themselves easily cause it is easy call for boycotting video game when your not a gamer  or to call for boycotting the world cup  when your not an football fan or when your team is not in finale  those woke people spend time trashing the internet instead of helping ngos related to the cause they say the defend they are hypocrites  thats what they are. how can we take them seriously
if I listened to the woke crowds I would not even read books.
it looks like a game rather than a sorry excuse for a cash shop.
im not the biggest hp fan but I liked the movies enough to want to live in the fantasy. I wanna go inside hogwart  be sorted by the hat and live the school experience  brew potions and discover its fascinating world. I also consider what jk rowling said to not be transphobic but pro-women and everyone is entitled to their opinions. even if she had said something anti-trans  it is still an opinion  she didnt act  she just said outlout something she was thinking  doesnt make her a criminal. it also happen I really despise the woke movement so all in all  I already bought the game even before knowing if its good or not  in the worst cases ill wait a few months for fixes  in the best case  I start 3 days early and stick it to the twitterina hoes. you are also right that gamers are great and friendly. Imade so much friends over the years and most of them are not judgmental. twitterina would come for you for your Christian belief  as an atheist  I wont  I just dont care. I can be in the same game as a muslim  Christian and buddhist and it doesnt matter  I respect all of them and I want all of them to have a good time.
the more they cry  the more we buy lol
Im pretty sure melonie is getting paid to talk about this game. she sure does talk about it a lot for someone who says they dont care about harry potter. that or she cant find anything else to talk about.
I didn t pre-order simply because I have this gut feeling that this game might be trying to use some sort of anti-woke dislike trap to boost sales  which we can see is proving very effective . judging by the devs s statements and the woke stuff they seem to have put into the game  like the game being set in the 1800 but apparently you already have transgender teenager wizards   I have this feeling that this might be the first successful case of woke devs using anti-woke hate and propped up  butthurt  thread to make cash  but when the game comes out it will be a wokefest.
macsplosions! gettem!
I preordered hogwartz legacy on ps5  mostly for a f u to these so called  activists  and I dont want to see them get there way and the devs never release the game because of it... and calling people bigots or transphobic just because they buy a game with their hard earned money and want to enjoy it doesnt make them a bad people. call me transphobic  but I support you and your policies   I just cant ignore the very basics of biology. plus hogwarts legacy looks amazing!!
amen sister
I am aware of what rowling said and I am still interested in the game. its not that I do not care about the plight of the trans community  they are often the de jour target for prejudice and ignorance. I am also a fan of the franchise and I am not throwing the baby out with the bathwater. I see comments online saying stuff like if you buy the game you are supporting rowling. I got news for you all. she was a billionaire before this controversy broke and nothing anyone does is going to change that. also if they turn their critical eye to other franchises in literature  tv  movies  video games  etc they will see that there are quite a few that were created  run  and or developed but people that were not so nice but I doubt all the righteous crusaders on this issue are boycotting other products or trying to get other franchises canceled. this is another example of the twitter mob making a lot of noise online about the issue of the day. I am glad to see so many people thinking for themselves. also if there are all these activists that care so much about trans rights  then why dont you put your effort into getting more like-minded political candidates elected to office in all levels of government to pass laws to enshrine more legal protection for that community. complaining about a media franchise doesnt change anything in society but its a lot easier to do than actually trying to affect change in society.
I quiet honestly am just sick of  cancel culture   so I decided to ignore those freaks for the most part... no matter what the topic is.in the end  little good comes from extreme standpoints and opinions.everyone can have his or her own opinion  I just dont believe that anyone is obligated to listen to it.and game studios that bow their head to cancel culture  should start growing a backbone again. watered-down games can be called aaa all they want  butall inclusive   morally correct   to whom ever it may be...  stories are just hypocritical and almost always boring and unrealistic  if not unbearable. afterall  those challenging  stories that question your stance on moral and right and wrong  that force you to think  and may challenge your very take on life  are usually the more exiting ones... whether they are portrayed in form of games  movies  tv series or books.
pre-order online ready to play
as a gay gamer  I intend to stream this game and expect lots of hate raids. I ll weather it  so Im ready. I just dont agree with the argument that  youre either with me or against me  used by some of these people.
not to sound like a  simp  but melonie is the prettiest woman on the internet
I want to play with a hog s warts on its legs I see.
I dont like the studio who made the game so I probably wont being buying it anytime soon. Im loving the woke drama tho!
for me  I am a fan of harry potter  the game does look good  and want to spite the woke culture
because gamers will always buy games they want to play. the one that want to cancel were not going to buy it anyway.
real debate between me and one of these  progressive  pastors pastor   you shouldn t be openly disagreeing in that way because we re called to love our neighbors. me   youre openly disagreeing with me right now  does that mean you dont have love for me  pastor    crickets
brett cooper dropped your comment on her comment section on this topic
hImelonie  I am a centrist democrat.  I think that everyone is who they are   however they are and thats ok. I am over 60 so I still say he and her  and thats should be ok because that is me. I bought this game because I want to play this game..........  no one should tell me what to watch what to play what to say or how to say it. the extremism s on both sides of the isle is the problem in our whole society. there are good and bad and mean and nasty people on all sides.
one of the funniest aspects of this whole thing is that jk rowling has nothing to do with hogwarts legacy. the mob has  imo unfounded  beef with jk and therefore hp  but this product hasn t even been touched by her. this is basically like boycotting someone for doing a cover song of michael jackson or r kelley.
1. I preordered just to piss off the cancel mob2. I am a fan of harry potter series3. I am my own person and mob mentality is for the weak of mind.4. women have a uterus  Imarried one and got 2 kids.
the crazy part about the wokies trying to cancel hogwarts legacy is that the game is literally going to be woke. save this comment.
I hope hogwarts is good enough to get goty by the end of all this just so these cancel clowns get mad enough to stop playing games as a whole. they need a new hobby
my reason for wanting to own a copy of hogwarts legacy is not because Im discouraged by the woke mob in telling me what I can and cannot buy just because they hate the creator of the series for having a different political view than them so that lousy reason should somehow influence my decision in not buying the game on behalf of their stupid wokeness hate train  but rather Im buying the game simply because Im just an avid fan of magic-related games that is aesthetically cool  that also so happens to be rich in lore. ugh... itsucks hogwarts legacy will be readily available for all other consoles at the earliest date compared to the nintendo switch s... and I just found out  bout this recently too... that means everyone will have early access to the game but me...
1. I like harry potter.  specifically the movies 2. hogwarts legacy could be the next skyrim or oblivion  at least for harry potter fans. 3. I dont disagree with jk rowling on trans issues. so her opinions dont bother me. if the game ends up being good its a double win. I get a good game and I end up annoying annoying people.
legends pirate games
speaking as a progressive this is another example of the woke fanatics not being smart enough to see they are attacking the wrong thing. they should be cheering this game since its going against jk and trying to distance the franchise from her. like they should of cheered ghostbusters afterlife since thatshowed you could respect the source material while still having a diverse cast. they attack what actually helps their cause while defending what destroys it.
lady  you are really pretty and you have a good personality. love the videos. I expect to get stupid replies for this comment.
Ive been looking forward to this game for a while.  the fact that it pisses off woke arseholes is just a bonus for me.
I haven t seen the game yet.  how does it play   is it a good story   good controller scheme   Im not buying something just because some cancel mob doesnt like it.
those hate raiders can boost your numbers bwahaha! show em!  d
@melonie mac go boom  definitely!
hello cleveland!! we are hateboner!!
regarding the talking points of oh  you are harming the trans community if you pre-order this game  or oh  you are not supporting the trans community if you pre-order this game  and so on...a  sales figures of a freakin video game has literally no impact on group a  community b  or demographic c.b  last I checked  people dont owe anything to strangers.  I owe nothing to the trans community.  Im indifferent.  they owe me nothing and I owe them nothing.  simple.
hey mel just a heads up if you ever want to see how much dislikes a vid has there is a extension thatshows dislikes
all this bs convinced me to pre-order the deluxe edition of the game instead of buying it during a steam sale...  I consider it about 30 dollars well spent because its time the lunacy gets stood up to and for the mob to get pushed back against.  the funniest part of all this is that jk rowling is a leftist and because she said one factual statement that the mob didn t like they now attack her and her creation like a pack of rabid dogs.  the game looks legit good  so if my money can help knock the rabies driven down a peg all the better.
its a bit weird that rowling is considered the enemy when she s a liberal feminist. she s just not the  correct  kind of liberal feminist.
16 28 amen sister.
its funny that you say they are using the excuse that you care more about the game than u do about trans people. I would have trolled them and said.  yes I care more about a fun video game than people. sorry.
they dont have any amount of power nor dont have the skills to control it
I preordered this morning  my wife wants to play it . I just wanna watch woke losers cry
I like the wizarding world. the hp books were always sort of underwhelming for me  but I loved reading lore and finding out how forces of the world worked. youre not about to find me not buying a game because of some culturally irrelevant woman across the fucking ocean
I get to fight trolls  you mean I can fight woke people  lets goooo. im in.
the steam tags made me want it more. a game where youre a villain capitalist who is evil to minority groups  sign me up!
18 33 name of the song
the game will do well. its going to do well because people like harry potter  games   fun. they aren t part of the less than 1  of the miserable people who care jk says women exist. screw these idiots. the cry bullies who hate themselves  nothing more.
its funny how being anti-woke is just buying quality content. eg yellowstone appeals to people because of its good writing thatstays true to setting  thats enough to make it anti-woke
its all the harry potter fans. most of the people I know who want this game dont even play video games but they need to play this  and steam is the most accessible way for them not being gamers  since most people have a pc or laptop
personally   I dont mind if some folks buy it to make a statement.  they dont seem to realize that the tactics they employ are those of other extremist groups.   retaliation.  intimidation.  intolerance of other views.   this is a big complex world.   not everyone will agree with your ideologies.   the emotional weakness and immaturity they display is sad.
I dont even play video games but will buy this just to piss these loons off
I care more about harry potter than I care about transgenderism  because one of these things exists  and the other is only within the minds of mentally ill people.  Im not a fan of the series  but at least its not actively trying to mutilate children  so I ll take it.
its because the woke community isn t the majority and the rest of the world are learning that ignoring the woke is the way to go .
yup  I can see it in my dashboard too    my like rates are almost unanimously above 90
@melonie mac go boom  Imeant for vids posted by other users! as far as your likes go I try to like each one I watch.    keep up the good work!
because its a harry potter game.
I wasn t really interested in this game  but it looks really good! if this has good game play and makes the woke cry babies reeeee Im so down!
I think the majority of people buying this game  like me who grew up with the movies and book releases. we waited 20 years to get the game we wished for as kids. not that the first hp games back then been bad  first 3 been really good the rest been meh. but this rpg style unconnected to the books direct story was what many people wanted so long  and we dont care.  plus if I had to double check everythign for wokeness  I would not be able to buy anythign most likely. plus the people who active work on this game are not sharing jk mindset  or whatever.  people like tom cruise movie too right  and I would not say he is someone to support when I look at the private person and what he is doing and into. I am just tired of this topic  at this point and do what I always do buy a game because I like how it looks
hot take  letting trans people create themselves in a game with a character creator thats meant let you put yourself in said game isn t woke. but getting rid of gender as a whole by calling male and female body type 1 and body type 2 is.playing a game where the main character is gay  ellie  isn t woke. there are gay people in this world  and there s nothing wrong with putting them in mature rated games.but playing a game were the character you created to be you that winds up being gay despite the choices you ve made is woke. I feel like the original mass effect games. we re the only ones that did it right. you could be male or female shepherd and you could be gay or straight. it was your choice.
narrated daddy kitten  pleased God did he  I heard ambassador of God    link God over him and save  saying   all the sins of my followers will be forgiven except the loud ones. an example of such disclosure is that a person commits a sin at night and though God screens it from the public  then he comes in the morning  and says   o so-and-so  I did such-and-such  evil  deed yesterday   though he spent his night screened by his Lord  none knowing about his sin  and in the morning he removes God s screen from himself.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        . reference	   sahih al-bukharI 6069
I really hope this game never go war of mordor. marketplace update in the coming months. all those customizations speaks storefront.
what s not be excited about it   its an open world crpg.  its probably not woke and the graphics and world-building is amazing.   here s the irony  I figured it just another cash-grab and I was ignoring it until the reeeeeeeeeeee started...
just wanted to point out that there is something wrong with your sweater hoodie. itseems only the sleeves are working.  p
fortunately  woke  Christianity will never take over. some denominations may go that way but there are enough real followers of Christ out there to not allow it to happen. there s a fine line between loving the lost  and joining them in sin.
ubisoft is losing money and worried. they make some of the most progressive games in the industry. hogwarts legacy looks like a real game and is getting a lot attention from those amongst the progressives but this only show how weak the woke movement is. does this mean that a game publisher like ubisoft might experiment with their last title before they go bankrupt. say a game that is targeted towards the largest gaming demographic. white men. maybe they could go with a name like final fantasy. they could call it final adventure fantasy.
nobody takes clowns seriously. thats all.
had no idea sofia was transgender I been following her on twitter for weeks. hmmmm
melonie you already fight trolls everyday
yea  I dont give a shit about political views of other people. hogwarts as a game looks great. so Im gonna day 1 thatshit.
ima steal a line from the very  intelligent  philosopher aoc  that guy is just mad bcuz he cant date you lol
I dont think it will even be that good but it will be imposable to get a good review because it will be review bombed by both sides

states have legislation passing that bars drag shows for kids among other laws
loool true
the first few seconds of the video I thought she had no arms lol
wtf I can buy this now   oh nvm
twitter is diminished
lol @ hate boner  that was great
@melonie mac go boom when you going on podcasts  also get some beef with h3h3 that would be fun .
they did this with duke nukem forever. a lot of fems got mad calling itsexist and called for a boycott. it just made the game sell more.
people just  dont care of those crying babies. and the majority of people dont even know  they  exist
because I love you  and want to experience that game with yoy
invade  is the appropriate wording.
u know what they say tell me not to do something what am I going to do
ima buy it just because of the woke...
hey melonie so pretty the good news is the fact gamers  wanting to play hogwarts legacy and millions will do and haters can suck it hard.
10 35  feminists brought this onto themselves.
thanks
hImelonie! waves
4 45 melonie wylin yall lmao
let these people scream and cry. who cares what they say or do !
heck I got the deluxe version after looking through the videos for it. just remember they re muppets  they have no idea what they re doing or saying just repeating what other filled their heads with. they re not original  not unique  and thats what upsets them.
commenting to feed the algorithm
what does woke mean
let s all fight back and cancel all of the woke people!!!!!!
I ll buy the game  but not on steam. I dont buy anything on steam that uses denuvo.
why are you yelling at me
the fact the sjws are buying hp books trying to own jk is hilarious coz the money goes straight to her lol
its a game where there fighting trolls maybe it hit a nerve
have we confirmed the  genocide simulation  feature
I think that john guy likes you
I bought this game because harry potter is my childhood. fuck everyone who tells me what to do.
being woke is  a joke. Im looking forward to the hogwarts game and so are my kids
amen
first it was wotc and now its limited run games.  what is up with these  nerd  companies shooting themselves in the foot lately   get off your damn soapboxes and just sell me the product!  they are everything thats wrong with the industry.  same thing goes for the game  journalists .  they re all just grifters who need to leave the hobby
not a harry potter fan  not missing much.wonder if the game will be buggy as shit lol
I still want to play genocide simulator
pop filter plsedit  thats a rude way to say that   but I can hear every p and t  doing fine though.
u should make a velma video its ridiculous
those that think Christendom is all about being agreeable forgot about the crusades
I ll buy 4 and break 3 just to fuck with the people that dont want me to get it and play. I dont even like harry potter that much anymore but I am actually curious about the game.
I dont even get it... what are they mad about  rowling isn t even involved in this game  right  is it just the fact thatshe created the universe  so silly.
the trans community needs to answer for what they did to daphne
why though
I wasn t interested in it til the leftists made a deal about it.
I love jk and  the game  even I am not straight and hate woke cult.
streisand effect in full motion. eff off woke mob
hard to listen to someone who cant wear a sweater right. lol jk
they dont buy nor care about any of these games
I bought the game because of the great graphics and game play not political garbage trolls are saying
are you giving away playstation 5  because my husband got a message from you saying he won and he needs to send 150 dollars for shipping!!
I said id never pre-order a game again after cyberpunk. but if it makes the woke wackos pissed then Im pre-ordering the deluxe version
if the game does end up being a big like its looking like it will bewatch the crazy left will somehow take credit for it  and in some weird twist of fate make a big character a gay trans icon hahahahaha
I bought it because it actually looks like a harry potter game that actually looks good its just a cherry on the top that the woke dont like it
its harry potter. it was gonna be the best selling game of the year outside of a rockstar or a call of duty gamethe wokie whining is just another nudge
hI  mel-mac!! its  me!!
this  Jesus turned over tables . thats one story a Bible writer included  okay. every other story   turn the other cheek    blessed are the meek . if someone wants your coat you should also give him your shirt. he faulted his own followers for trying to stop the romans from arresting him. but thank God for the turned over tables story! over and over again. even though it goes against everything he said.
I dont care about gay people or women or anything like that but I dont agree with the changing sex thing there is only two sexes  boy and girl lol
also I im getting bot replies offering scam rewards so heads up.
I preordered mine this week soley to spite the woke activists I never buy games on day of release its totally backfired on these idiots
u look like expensive version of greta thunberg ngl . ur pretty.
I will be buying this game purely to spite the degenerates reee ing against it.
did you not wash your hair today or something
I would never do that  thats a scammer
lookie here we got one o dem self hatin wokies lol seriously they all hate eachother and everything
because theres more sane people than woke people. ez peezy
I wish people stop simping for this game  they fired the lead dev who did videos similar to this one replying to anita sarkeesian and it let you make a nonbinary character  its woke  please guys stop simping for this game  if it was really a threat the media would attack it and devs would be fired and the studio would announce its making changes and if they didnt  they would be removed from steam and psn and xbox stores.
good. let them ree. I hope the game rules and continues to burn their trash narrative. they wont stop me from enjoying what I want to.
we need to use the word  heretic  more for fake woke Christians
for the sleepwoking   reality is their nightmare ... and God is their boogeyman... almighty God is a living man ...
harry pooter belongs to j.k so she can do what she likes with it everyone else should shut up or write their own garbage about weird children thats not even created for adults.
a vast majority of people want the original version vs the woke bullshit version which is obviously not a reflected version of reality!!!!
sorry melonie  but I have to say that you did tell a lie in this video. you said  journalists at kotaku   and we all know that there are no journalists working at kotaku. great video  though  as always. keep it up  and God bless!
literally  nobody cares. simple as.game could be trash  marketing could be trash  they could release no gameplay and just release the game out of the blue next week.the average person  the majority  just doesnt care about these kinds of issues that they d let them impact their daily life.they like video games  they want to play a harry potter video game.you cant expect the world to bend to your views  right or wrong. this woke agenda  and the expectation that the world needs to bend to your world view is mental. society doesnt exist to pander to your wants and whims. its so aggravating.just be a good person  dont treat people like crap.your purchase of a video game does not reflect your views on any particular subject matter.what s funny is these people probably dont even play video games generally.
gender dysmorphia. and the mentally ill love to voice their illness upon others. youre giving them too much credit.
im thinking of preordering the delux edition but if the game has woke stuff in it I dont want it....so maybe I should wait and see....if they removed genders do to pressure from woke stupidity its a red flag for me..
Im going to buy this game for the fantastical  immersive world. I ll buy  and give away a second copy because mentally ill fascists dont want me to.
I hope the game is good  but look at the history of the developer. they ve only made shitty disney games. Im waiting for reviews on this one.
I d love to stick it to the awful wokesters and buy the game  but I have zero interest in harry potter..
oh no the twitter swamp trolls are upset about something again...whatever shall we do!  oh I know  let me hit that preorder button!
game could be shit though. leaving who the winner inb4 game studios start hiring these blue hairs to cry on twitter
she also plagiarized her stories from more creative and intelligent male conservative authors. just reskinned it and called her series harry potter.
transphobic is a selling point imo.
then the game turns out to be garbage and everyone who pre ordered are embarrassed
baha facts  thank you!
over 60 will prolly never play the game - - but I bought it just because the woke mob is trying to cancel it
not getting this until I see reviews f politics
liberal dude here  if these so called woke journalist wants to push agendas  run for political positions. give all developers freedom to create whatever they want.
woke activists
dont pre-order  please. wait for the full game coming out and make a logical decision to buy it or not. pre-order the game  which tries its best to virtue signal and be inclusive  will make the woke craps be pushed more into the industry.
love it... the same activists tried to crap all over cyberpunk 2077. which ended up 3x more successful then their flagship witcher 3
a few important points need to be cleared up. firstly  if you want to play the  go play the game. who gives a fuck about jk rowling and her beliefs. I know she gets a royalty cut  but who cares. this is about enjoying your hobbies. whether its the fantasy world of hogwarts  or playing a  hopefully  good game.secondly  the hate this game is getting is coming from an extreme position. it is not representative of the typical viewpoint of pro-trans activists. its important to be clear that a lot of the claims made by the right are bogus and completely made up. I think jkr just kind of fell into that narrative and made her position be known based on a false narrative. men are not pretending to be women to assault women in the restrooms or any made up bullshit. there are men who assault women. there are men who assault women in women s restrooms. they are not pretending to be women to get access. they just walk in. similarly with  child mutilation  bullshit claim that melonie regurgitates. its a false narrative by extreme right wing activists. minors are not allowed to get bottom surgeries. top surgeries are done to cis gendered people more often than they are to trans people. of all ages. so  the claim that kids are being mutilated by gender affirming surgeries are misconstruing facts to paint a false narrative. if its not mutilation for a 16 year old cis girl to get breast implants  its not mutilation for a 16 year old trans girl to get breast implants. lastly  the typical left wing activist mindset is simply inclusion. its about accepting people regardless of who they are or what they are. your personal beliefs shouldn t dictate what someone else wants to do with their life. left wing activism isn t typically about  wokeness   as described by this video or right wing narratives. there is an extreme left belief  which is what fuels this particular hate over this game. the idea that if you buy the game  youre indirectly supporting jkr and if she is anti-trans  then youre anti-trans by supporting her. but enjoying a video game or the fantasy world she created and supporting her ideology are not mutual. one you can participate in one with participating in the other.
I dont give a shit about trans  but I love anything to do with hogwarts so there....
Jesus could do what he likes he s still the best advert for religion going. people who mock Christ or Christianity are cowards and liars too scared to criticise other faiths because they d be attacked if they did it.
I wouldn t hang around gamefaqs by the way. just got suspended for bullshit all because I said I was buying hogwarts legacy. seriously bro  the lefties aren t happy about this game doing well at all.
you didn t start dropping youtube content until susu started dropping hers. Imention this cuz y all sound way too similar. but her content has more variety  you only post cancel culture videos  try something more
boycott this game   cause of them adding denovo at the last minute. denovo  more like denobuy
everyone has gone way ott with there claims for some reason also includes being anti-semiotic as well as anti-transgender. I dont get it.love harry potter and game looks amazing.
people who hate predators and weirdos have something in common with predators and weirdos  they both say they hate predators and weirdos... just because you sit there and say you hate predators and weirdos how do I know youre not one we just hasn t got caught by the lawyer yet and its just saying those things to avoid suspicion  because nobody general speaking suspects anyone who hates so much predators and weirdos. you dont think predators and weirdos dont know this and have stuff for they say the same thing so that they too can not be viewed with suspicion   . the person who s the most aggressive and speaks out against a certain criminal or criminal acts is the most suspicious person to me.  considering I know someone who was sexually molested as a child under the age of 12 by sheriff.  sheriff who became sheriff by advocating aggressive crackdowns on pedophiles and sexual predators aggressively. people who viewed him as a hero for advocating in the protection of children as he so  lead in every interview. and yet turns around and sexually molest and threatens to kill if telling anybody a nine-year-old boy in recent years. ...  wouldn t surprise me if this youtuber sucks the pecker of a seven-year-old boy. nope  wouldn t surprise me at all. saying that you hate sexual predators and pedophiles does not exclude you from being possibly 1. the difference between a sex offender and someone who has no criminal record is this  one got caught in the other didn t. not having a criminal record doesnt necessarily mean or prove that youre a good person it could mean that youre far more worse but just never got caught
indoctrinated   brainwashed
your really pretty
I ll buy it. dont even like potteras for ladies suffering over woke stuff... you welcomed it. enjoy
I dont care about hp  never watched it
if Jesus saw a trans he would cast out them and they demons.
john phipps still being a typical feminist  lol
Ive been making youtube content since 2009 on my old channel  you must be new lol
@melonie mac go boom  thats probably it but I went back and looked and could only find your latest one from 11 months ago. anyway your content isn t bad at all wasnt tryna put it down  but all the latest ones Ive seen have all been about cancel culture while can be an interesting subject  I just know you being a smart gamer girl you got more for us  thx for being conscious tho  woke cutlure does get annoying af.
@melonie mac go boom  yeah I wasn t aware of your old channel lol  got ya
no I never welcomed this  most women are not feminists and it is ridiculous to lump us all in that in the same way that it is stupid that feminists say all men are bad. youre being just like what you hate.
they are not Christian
conservatives like prageru think its smart to put out fake and stupid cancel bs. no one doesnt want the game to be bad. I d say everybody s skeptical and alot of us aren t and itshows.
as my future wife  you need to either wear the sweatshirt or take it off. there is no inbetween.
imma play this game because its not a harry potter game its a game about hogwarts and your the mc..... plus any game made with harry potter in the name or in the game.... is horrible...
it all 3
I dont give a shit about harry potter and I do care about it more than trans people.
why do the women keep wearing the coats half way   or have their coat off of a shoulder.. is this supposed to be attractive  also  as a Christian.. shouldn t you  cover up  so you wont make Christians stumble thats what Ive heard.. but why do women do this o.o is this using some sex appeal. what is it...
this video is just as bad as the activists  the only result from this is more divide. buying the game isn t transphobic  but creating anti-woke drama for content is not helping anything. such a waste of time
the game is woke tho.y all are consumers and sheep
dont wanna push any buttons but witchcraft is a sin just saying
yes it is  but video games are not real and this isn t real witchcraft. thatsaid  if you feel convicted not to play it then you should listen to your convictions
@melonie mac go boom  oh no Im not religious spiritual sure on the side of light definatly but I ll be playing the crap out of this game
