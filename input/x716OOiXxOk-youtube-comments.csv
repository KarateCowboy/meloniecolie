at first  I thought this show was a tragedy but now I realize its a comedy
fun fact  in case you weren t aware  by this time  galadriel was married  had a daughter named celebrian  that went on to marry elrond.  galadriel is elrond s mom-in-law.
I am a simple man. I see galadriel in a place she s never been  wearing armor she s never worn and being gripped by a hatred that never happened... I automatically see it as a poorly written and poorly directed fanfic  ok  wokefic .diarrhea of power  2 10for those who dont know  in the second age  where the rings of power series takes place  lady galadriel would be far from it all  more precisely in lindon where she is married to celeborn and has a daughter with him  who will be elrond s future wife and arwen s mother. and after some time they went eastward  and established the kingdom of eregion.   Ive made a correction here  later  still in the second age  celeborn e galadriel become the Lord and lady of lothlorien. where galadriel is making lembas bread.   absolutely nothing that happens in this series is canon. this is all just a fanfic of the worst quality.
its crazy that amazon basically spent a billion dollars to create someone s fanfiction. literally all the fanfic clich s are present such as the ocs  random plot lines  shipping characters randomly  and the disregard of continuity with the source material. it really feels like amazon grabbed a random teen girl s fanfic journal and poured hundreds of millions of dollars into it.
elendil s wife  drownselendil  the sea is always right!
whoever built the tower violated every building code in the book  removing all structural supports and replacing it with ... a rope.  its sad to see crooked contractors  shoddy workmanship  waste of tax dollars and callous disregard for the safety of tenants  but the showrunners were adamant that they wanted to reflect the world as it is.  this is indeed a story that tolkien never wrote.
mel  youretelling the episode is so much more fun than actually watching the show. 10 out of 10 storytelling.
my favorite part was where gladreal screamed  not in my swamp  then turned into an elephant to crush the patriarchy  literal chills
my favorite part was when morgath escaped from the void and put us all out of our misery.
guyladriel  don lemonlas  methrandir  isildumb  gaylendil  disa nuts... this show is one huge meme. I hope writers of this show are actually 4chan anons and they trolled bezos with this
discount eowyn s hipocrisy is on a whole other level  I chocked on my water when she spoke the frase about not seeking revenge
this show as been a giant meme since the teaser trailer dropped. luckily the memes have been golden.
my favorite part was at the end when gandolf looked down at guyadriel and said that ll do pig. that ll do. I got a tear in my eye.
there was this really old age of empires meme  destroying castle with archers  that amazon just made real
watching woke media crash and burn has become a genre of entertainment unto itself.
best point   you cantell when someone is making a passion project   and when they re not. that can be said about so many bad productions in recent years.
need someone to deepfake galadriel s creepy smiling face as she rides her horse on the beach onto galadriel s determined face as she gallops into battle. the inappropriateness of the situation would be hilarious.
my favorite part was where galadriel turned to elrond and said  where s jackie
so she stops halbrand from murdering adar for revenge but inst her whole arc is revenge for her brother against sauron great writing
I want a mob style show where bezos is interrogating the writers and showrunners about where the money went  pulp fiction style
good one  !!! of course the new joker film just might be a joke!!!
best comment
it is...we are all going to die because of this show.
its a farce.
yep. total comedy
you must give credit when its due  and sir this is a good comment
can see why they left the fortress with the best chokepoint  so the num num horsemen can charge into the village.... at least the writers were thinking of thatset up....
funny  I said the exact opposite about she-hulk.
if you like a tragedy unfold  yes then itsure is funny
except  like many modern  alleged comedies  it needs a laugh track so viewers know when to chuckle.
elrond actually married celebrian early third age  but they should at least have met and already fallen in love by this point in the timeline.the only way to rectify this is to say she abandoned her family for her revenge seeking. I have heard a rumor thatshe might bring up celeborn soon and imply she thinks he s dead  I say thinks because it would be an even worse lore break for him to actually be dead  but her believing he is also dead could be part of her motivation...
@david conway jr. but how can galadriel be a girl boss slay queen and have smexy times with sauron if she is married. clearly the retcon was cecessary for her agency!
@david conway jr.  yes  at one point tolkien mentions that elrond and celebrian first met in about s.a. 1700.  he fell in love with her immediately  but kept his feelings to himself.  it would be another 1800 years before they married  in t.a. 109.  elves move slowly!  the circumstances were that elrond had been sent by high king gil-galad with an army to assist eregion against sauron s attack  after he forged the one ring .  elrond s force was too small to stop sauron s juggernaut  but he rescued those he could then withdrew northward and founded a secret refuge at a place called rivendell. one of the people he rescued was celeborn  husband of galadriel.  sauron s army was chased back towards mordor by a numenorean army  and then galadriel came to rivendell to rejoin her husband. she brought their daughter celebrian with her  and the first sparks flew between cele and elrond.  after all  elrond had saved her father s life...
this show would be better if they haven t nerfed galadriel from a powerful leader who uses magics into a teenager evil warrior who is about to bang with evil white-man and just become a single mother.  sauron will become arwen s grandfather  and elrond s father in law . would be a lot more interesting if they had kept the lore and we had celebrian from galadriel and celeborn.  celebrian would look a lot like galadriel  you would still be able to name drop her mother to lend gravitas and she can be depicted as younger and more developmental than galadriel. on top of that  you get a built in slow-burn love story between her and elrond. but on this show  seems elrond is only interesting in banging with thorin using a mithril dildo.
@videos variados  thats harsh  but fair!
galadriel in this show has already had 17 abortions and the reason sauron is in hiding is because she invented the me too movement. smart sauron..
funfact we dont know if elrond already met galadriel daughter  never mentioned but could be at some point. if they decide too lol
@bradley whitebird  fun fact. celebrian and celeborn are nerver brought up in the show making thatstatement completely baseless.
considering that not much is known about celebrian during the 2nd age amazon could have made her the main character as opposed to destroying galadriel entirely  although that would have not erased the awful karen-character that amazon chose to write .
the only way you can watch the rings of shit is as a parody. it is unwatchable otherwise.
its a travesty
this makes so much more sense
hey  muses  who s gonna take this one  then melpomene  touches nose not itthalia  fuck
may Imake a minor correction to your assessment  dont call it a fanfic  call it a trollfic. there s a small prerequisite to writing fanfiction  you have to actually be a fan  which none of these people are.  and fanfiction authors aren t backed by a billion dollar corporation that attacks its customers
dude what are you on about she was in lindon and later on based hollum in eregion where she ruled with celeborn and celebrimbor and his jewelsmiths move there soon after. they wont move past the misty mountains before sauron declared himself and waged war against the elves.by this messed up timeline she would be either in eregion or lindon but most definetely not in lothlorien.
@juuso vuolle  yes! Im sorry. this chronology of the series still confuses me. and I still have doubts about where she would really be right at that time. because in this period galadriel and celeborn already made contact with the nandorin settlement  later known as lothl rien.but what I really meant is that galadriel wouldn t be in the middle of any war.
@lonesilverw0lf  true   _  this shit is a wokefic
@logan_wolverino  well she would still be in hollum because she left it due to annatar showing up. which she adviced against.
thanks for the legitimate criticisms and background from books I either never read or cannot remember
@jahankhan  yeah its all pretty confusing story details to remember. doesnt help that when they went through tolkiens writings they decided to publish several versions of the stories.
corporations shouldn t be allowed to make stories anymore thanks to this  and everything made by disney now
@juuso vuolle  but can you see why its all confusing here  there is no annatar and no celeborn in this series. I dont know why they decided not to use celeborn  but as for annatar  I heard that amazon doesnt have the rights to use the character. this adaptation is going to be a mountain of poop.
yes  it has all the crappy writing of a tween fanfiction. but tweens aren t backed by a billion dollar corporation thatshould know better  which makes this a step down from fanfiction into the realm of trollfiction. this shit is an insult to fanfiction. seriously  Ive read a high schoolers fanfiction better put together than this.
brandon s daughter s diary would have been a better base.
I wouldn t even insult fans by calling this fan fiction. this is corporate quota checking. its like they pumped a bunch of fantasy dialogues and scenes into an algorithm and this is what the computer spit back out.
hm... I heard that billion dollar thing almost everywhere... do we have any proof of that number anywhere  maybe its just a marketing scam to fool us. or did they spend the most of it to own some rights  what on earth could justify a billion dollar into that production... all looked cheap and could be done by a tenth of it. maybe the cgI was so expansive.
watch it  in the next episode all of the important characters survived because they fell into some hole that just happened to be there or just wake up from the ash without any burn marks
@moric  Im of the understanding they shelled out a billion just the rights for part of the appendices and a few other bits  plus a reported 50million per episode. and there s supposed to be a planned 5 seasons of this. of course they wont give us the actual receipts for this. Im of the opinion that they very well could ve spent that money already  but not into the actual movie. Im betting its a massive money laundering and or embezzlement scheme. I want to be wrong  but Ive been right before.
@lonesilverw0lf  max bialystock and leo bloom must be the producers for this show then
at least fanfiction has an element of reverence or affection for the source material that compels someone to undertake the task of writing it. this show is defined by a schizophrenic combination of envy   repulsion   disregard for the superior source material while still wanting to mine it for its value as an ip. its completely dishonourable behaviour thatshouldn t be a surprise considering we are talking about the moral and ethical vacuum that is hollywood.
@iris amanda  thats the mark of something written by committee. idk for sure if that happened with rop  but yeah thats definitely how it feels. just a committee of talentless execs throwing around disconnected ideas.
I ll have to correct you with one thing. this is not fan fiction. calling it that is an insult to fans that would have made something way more in line to the source material. this is corporate head canon. completely devoid of professor tolkien s work.
and in the first age she spend years and years talking with melian the maia who at that time was the wisest and least evil being on the entire flat earth disk of arda. and after 550 years of that we get this spoiled brooding child who doesnt even seem to understand that no matter what happens  literally even if the entire planet were destroyed  she will see her brother again. and her father. and her other brothers. lmao
@john s  yeah im just pretending this stupid show doesnt even exist. cant take itseriously.
amazon managed to interprete galadriels character from being ambitious to being a warrior consumed by thoughts of vengence and becoming straight up more evil than the orcs she is fighting.  and also not much smarter.her motivation  vengence. her means  dominating others with violences or the threat of it. e.g. threatens to kill elendir for telling her  stealing a ship isnt a smart move. or she threatens arda with genocide and torture of the beings he considers family.  straight up psychopathic.I guess thats the modern hero now. we used to call that toxic masculinity  but a tyrant is a tyrant no matter the genitalia.
lmao  making lembas bread  cracked me up
but do youreally think they spend a billion dollars on it it truly looks cheap
now  thats closure!
lol Im glad someone else thought the same thing! I had galadriel saying that in my head as soon as he said she drowned lol
I still dont know what that even means.  sea is always right
are you implying the world of amazon s lotr is half-assed and shabby  blasphemy  sirrah!
thank you  you have been selected for a prize m1pro macbook and ps5only to claim telegram
rofl!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Im gonna have to watch rings of power now lol
@vhea   taylor s yorkies  bad idea
@melonie mac go boom  thank you  thank you
meme you fools!!!

this is one of the funniest damn things I have read in a while. omfg
did smash mouth start playing
@melonie mac go boom   hImelonie and thank you!  your content always lighten up my mood!  kind greetings  a fan from good old europe
ain t seen the show but bruh
that was epic.
an elephant huh  hmmm
you forgot brown-wymn
inceldur
now that would subvert my expectations if that were true.
I prefer imbecildur myself
I forgot feminem
disa nuts
I actually like disa tho. her  elrond and durin are the only tolerable part of the show.
were you drinking  sea water
@Christian farmer  ...which is always right.
@moric  the weird culty chanting is so strange in this show.
isn t it hippocrisy when the sin is comitted on horseback
the memes must flow.
one meme to rule them all!
lol my favorite random movie mashed up so far
I understood that reference!
and our nation with it.
another reviewer believes they set the quotas first of black   latinx  and any number of mind numbing checked boxes   before they even started to write the story. I d have to believe
brings me joy that the weirdos are incapable of making enjoyable media
yup! thats me whenever some woke new trash comes out. some people get all up in arms and upset. but I am over here just thoroughly entertained.
@joe neltner  have you taken a college course in the past decade  even in fucking math classes the professor will tell you how important diversity and inclusion are. really puts into perspective why all new films are so fucking bad.
this ride was for business
and afterwards she pulls out a light saber to kill barney the dinosaur l  to destroy the tower of patriarchy.
nothing was even thought through for the most basic of holes
I think I could watch a minI series or a movie of this
basement scene or reservoir dogs corporate board room blame game
my favorite part was when the dragon landed in whiterun  and killed several guards while using the  its morbin time  thu um. couldn t believe he learned all 3 shouts.
adar is a good character and the actor is excellent. he has  acting with his eyes  down to a science!
melonie feeling herself quoting her own tweets at the beginning of this video is quite the mood.
as a gentleman  and a man of God  I will apologize in advance for dropping this obvious tagline meme in melonie s comments...image  any picture of morfydd clark s galadriel.caption   the rings of power  the c is always right.
bronwyn  theo and arondir were all covered in dirt and blood in the tavern  but as soon as the battle is over they are totally clean.
so adar s master plan was to cause a volcanic eruption  why!  he is currently in the splash zone!!!
was interesting how arondir fights the biggest ork... who happens to be unarmed. because reasons.also  when guyladrilel said that thing about how you cant quench your thirst with seawater... I couldn t help but think...the sea is always right!
its rather poetic that the main problem with this tolkien adaptation is  the writing.
it totally caught me off guard that they left the tower too and had the battle in a three building  village.  I actually thought they were going to have a really cool fight at the tower and  at the last minute  collapse the tower onto the orcs... or something of this nature. then I was like  oh... ok. we ve abandoned the tower. well  surely the entire orc army will be crushed then...  err... yikes.
try to picture galadriel from this show spending any amount of time with melian the maia like she did in the first age lmao. try to picture actual galadriel from the first age deciding to go after sauron despite knowing full well her brother is just in mandos and she is guaranteed no matter what to see him again.
am I right this episode was the first time we see galadriel sit down  still took her 6 hours.but then she tries to stare the vulcano to death anyway.
great channel! just found it because of the rings of power  at least something good came from this show. about the rings of wokeness  I still wanna know how did they spend that 1bI budget  writers  director and most of the cast are just amateur  its one dumb scene after another  if they said this is a spaceballs version of lotr  I still could had understand  or not  there is nothing to laugh at this show  only from the memes born from it . and on next ep  the evil harfoots are back  and time to see thorin making suppository with mithril to cure the elves  elrond must be looking forward for it  alphabet representation!  being serious  despise the writing being a mess  they try to tell too many stories at same time just resulting in nothing   another main problem is that the showrunners doesnt understand nor believe on the values that tolkien incorporated in the story. tolkien was a catholic and his work is inspired by the moral values of the church  such as compassion  bilbo frodo not killing gollum   self sacrifice and their ascension to heaven  frodo and bilbo going on the last ship to valinor   resurrection  gandalf   and you can also see it on many times on the dialogues   such as when frodo says to gandalf in moria he didn t want this burden and gandalf just says  so do all who live to see such times but that is not for them to decide. all we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us.   or gandalf telling to pippin that death is just another path that everyone needs to take. but the showrunners dont understand or dont believe in any of these things  that why we end getting stupid quotes like  why the ship floats and stones dont  or a stupid speech about  immigration and elves taking our jobs   which is just modern politics  different from the original lore where people of numenor envied the elves  immortality  mortal vs immortals  thats more poetic and timeless than  modern politics about immigration  . and I can say the same thing about disney  the woke disney lost it magics because itstopped believing in princesses  they dont believe that a girl can be a princess and find love with a man  they dont even believe that girls and boys exists anymore. dreams and fantasy are not allowed to exist anymore  everything must be rooted on what modern activists like  everything must have a check box  everything must be about  me  being in the screen.  I really hope this representation bullshitstops soon  its killing art and just creating narcissists. representation is for politics  town council and things like that  not art entertainment  . and until this political crap continues invading art  we wont see more timeless movies like the Lord of the rings  the prince of egypt  old star wars  old toy story  etc. our only hope left are the japanese industry thatstill continues to delivery good story and characters through anime and manga.
thank you ms. mac for your great sacrifice in watching this show so we dont have to go through the pain of it. I will pray for your sanity.
this is the first time Ive watched one of your videos. but your commentary is the best. and youre easy on the eyes. keep it up.
solid review  without heavy bias on any side
its a measure of the quality of the show that people have to make their own entertainment with memes.
just waiting till guyladriel says  girl power  to explain how she did something.
hey I saw my tweet again! yay! I enjoy your content melonie. are you going to watch the whole series or stop after this  I dont plan on watching any of it. thanks for taking one for the team. you talking about about this show is more interesting then of the rop. have a good day melonie. Im so happy that your parents are coming and going to move near you.
saw someone point out that bronwyn gets shot by 2 arrows  but is only treated for 1  the other one magically stops existing
by the end of episode 6 I came to the honest conclusion that they actually tried to make it bad. even the best scenes are at best visualy pleasing. I litteraly gotta get myself super high to atleast make it funny every God damn thursday night to be sure to handle the one hour.
everything with elrond and durin was great. they have proper lines  interesting plot and their baner is good. the rest of the show is dogshit. great cgi.
yeah. he s ever more likeable than guyladriel.
loooooooooooool
I c what you did there...
I c.
just a c  itseems a lot lower than a c...
rofl
orc slashed the neck of an elf  he bled 1 dot. it has to be clean for e- everyone.
good observation
there can be only one.
I thought I was seeing things  youre right
they actually forgot this ..... how many more millions do they need to get some quality control in this show
I knew I wasn t bugging.
actually  if you watch thatscene again it looks like the first one doesnt even hit her  but she makes a sound like it does and drops to her knees. then she gets the arrow through her shoulder from behind. I think that it was a miscommunication where she thought she was supposed to get hit twice  or maybe they initially planned to   but only ended up getting hit once.
what you are missing is that halbrand is sauron and that adar apparently tried to kill him. this is why halbrand wanted to kill adar. they also named halbrand their promised king of what is now revealed to be mordor and mount doom erupting.
little correction.they dont get the sword back. they get the packet that adar was carrying  pass it between multiple people. a packet that is super important  and dangerous.and not a single one of them decides to open and check the package  before discovering it was a decoy  when given to a child.
so sauron designed a magic blood key just to open a flood gate thats never maintained for hundreds of years and still works  theres no faulty or flawed design and everything just conveniently flow with the precise trenchest that was dug recently by not sauron .......all according to sauron plan hundreds of years ago ......sauron must be a master designer   topography   architect   physicist   magic    engineer   blacksmith and also clairvoyant  he got my vote
you are so right. adar is by far the most interesting character. I cant help but root for him.
galadriel s armor is again showing her allegience to feanor  because we all know that they were friends that would wear the other one s crest on their chestplate... but we probably should be thankful that it isnt just scales printed on a cloth like in the case of miriel...
I ll always remember when guyladrrrriel walked and said  oh sam...  and then through the ring of power into the brand new mountain.
you can not quench your thirst with salt water  it was her dodging a arrow basically scraping the ground with her hair on horseback and cutting off a uruk head all in one motion all her action scenes are a joke
I burst out laughing when she did that ducking the arrow while on horseback move lol.
they are going to turn sauron into a sympathetic tragic antihero through habrands love being spurned by galadriel.
it was so obvious he was going to swap out the hilt   the fact that they didn t bother unwrap it is just beyond comprehension  galadriel should have the moment she got her hands on it because it would have been an important clue for her to consider.  I did laugh at adar s horse just getting up   running off after being tripped  cant have a horse being seriously injured after being tripped at a full gallop.even with stuff happening this episode I just dont think its enough  they try to go for epic shots or emotional scenes  but they haven t built the characters up enough for it  so its all feels so unearned.  as for the village getting engulfed in the pyroclastic flow cloud at the end  they re close  enough to the volcano that its just not possible for any of them to survive  thats scalding steam  200-800 degrees c   choking ash   poison gas moving at a speed that would level the village.
I have known about you for a while and I think you are awesome! I love what you have to say. please keep dropping female truth bombs on the world.
tolkien had no message he hated allegory its just a complex and yet simple story peter jackson just adapted it to the best of his ability.
galadriel treats sauron like as if he s just another elf or man thatshe can assassinate  meanwhile he s an evil shapeshifting angel who hasn t even poured his power into the ring yet like does she really think no one else had this idea before her
I knew bronwyn would save arondir in the fight with the orc  because of course that cliche event would have an entire scene written around it. still  though it was completely predictable  it wasn t too bad.the lamest part was the black smoky blood sword as a key to burst the damn and flood mt. doom to make it erupt. thatstone carving is on the wall of the fort that the elves have garrisoned for hundreds of years. wouldn t they have been searching for the  sword-key  or something how would the uruks know how to dig the trenches  civil engineering was part of the secret message left to them by sauron at the end of the 1st age  once the trenches were dug  couldn t the damn be ruptured by some other means than a magical sword key  like  literally using a graug or just ropes and uruk power  or shovels and a lot of digging  if the uruks can build a fortress  I would think they could tear one down.lastly  the pyroclastic flow just killed galadriel  elendil  isidur  tar-muriel  perhaps halbrand  wtf are they writing like  how could they survive this pompeiI type eruption  in which all the trees and vegetation for hundreds of square miles have been incinerated maybe galadriel s magic finally appears to create a tiny force shield around important characters  if not  then this is stupid. killing characters who are pivotal for the events to come  or saying they lived by some means of luck  would be stupid.
there s a tampon in me!  - galadriel
question  how did guyladrielalala know there was a fight going on there  is it near the coast where they landed  did they send out scouts days before who then returned with the news  there s a large group of orks about to attack a human village   or did she just know because she s so strong and wise and awesome
from what Ive been able to piece together on this series  the problem is  they promised tolkien fans guccI and when the dust settled what we got was walmart. a cheap knock off is not a love letter.
my favourite part of the episode was when guyladriel yelled  times up! let s do this. leeroooooooy! jeeeeenkins!  and then proceeded to crush the patriarchy.
this is a perfect description of just about everything right now.
here s a theory  galadriel is actually eowyn from the hobbit timeline  time traveling into another universe to defeat sauron. the further away you get from the main timeline  the less things make sense. which is why the show is the way it is
adar has potential  Ive seen some theories that he might be maedhros who would have a reason to resort to dirty tactics to get back at sauron. that being said  I dont feel like maedhros  character arc entirely fits adar  but then the writers have made it abundantly clear that they dont care about canon.
its because he is the only one to show humanity  that he cares about his  people
@spitshinesneakers  isn t maedhros supposed to have been dead for hundreds of years at this point  he could be maglor  but this whole thing is rather stupid. I feel bad because the people who watch this show will never get the chance to experience a good second age show.
@haytham kenway  yeah maedhros is supposed to be dead. but they ve already changed so much that you cant discount them pulling something like that.
he s pretty good ye
there is a message in lotr  its just told plainly for everyone to notice. because if you have to hide it in allegory and fancy words  its probably not worth hearing.the message is  even the humblest of creatures can change the world  with the aid of friends  courage and dedication! plain and simple.
if I remember we see a picture of galadriel covered in ashes. I guess she did jack shit but look at the burning wall.
she watched what is happening on amazon prime  just like on spaceballs where they used the show s vhs tape to find  princess vespa s location.
its weird cause they just bring the patriarchy to these people  you know  named halbrand the king somehow.like thats gonna solve anything smh.
the tower collapsing was hilarious!
so true about the fortress. even more so considering that they had time to flee to the village anyway. so why not farther away until daylight  since amazon s orcs burn on sun...
your reenactment of the show was probably better then the show its self.
I dont think nobody will ever be able to beat peter jackson s lotr
it took me a week to get through episode 3. I dont think I can finish this series. lol
love your videos!  thanks for sharing you amazing sense of humour!
but as long as you feel representated on screen  nothing else should matter. Imean  the only reason I liked lotr was because Im a 4 2  extremely hairy man with huge eyes who never wears shoes and lives in a hole and went on to save the world from the most evil and powerful creature ever to grace the earth.
6 episodes in I haven t watched one just clips and reactions and that golfing weekend with abby still more appealing than a full episode  now where s the clips of my sexy orc ladies
Im pretty sure that amazon is banking on people rewatching the episodes because they have to understand what the hell is going on
entertainment can certainly have a relevant message and representation  and even have lackluster sets and costumes  while being irresistible and compelling. the writers and show runners need to have the talent  skill set  and love to pull it off though  which is where rop breaks down. it has a bunch of failings  and none of the things that make us fall in love with it anyway.
so anyway. adar supposedly killed sauron and stuff  but he seems to just have completed one of his master plans  I assume  where is this headed
the best thing was that one actress was naturally mid  mostly unrelated to anything  but there you go.   - melonie mac
the whole show can be summed up with  sooo uhh  yeah  that happens
8 47 lol this part cracked me up!  yeah dude I felt it too.
my favorite part was when gladrial walked into a pyroclatic cloud thats usually like 500 degrees celsius  or hotter comparing suicide
I couldn t tell if events in this episode were meant to be clever foreshadowing or if it was just poor writing  editing and directing.  also  I felt really bad for the horses... how many kilometres were they sprinting and in such a vector as if they knew exactly where they were needed. like  did they send out an eagle as a scout or did someone from the village get a message to them somehow  maybe they would just keep going till they found orcs.  good thing it was the first village they came across.  ugh  my suspension of disbelief is in tatters.and the fodder that knows they re fodder dont say anything  not a peep  just well   we deserve this    oh hImark    bleeeehhh - death .
after I laughed hilariously upon seeing a googly-eyed warg I did what never bodes well for shows Im watching  I picked up my phone.so I have found myself watching more about critics of the show than the show itself since then. Ive tried to watch since ep3  it but it feels like  Im forcing myself to do so.
sorry for the torture. still love ya melonie
can I just add that galadriel walks into a pyroclastic flow that can reach over 800 c 1500 f and will instantly kill a person like it was nothing.
it was like one of those wire tension tables that look like they re floating thats how that works
this was the best episode thus far but my problem is the previous episodes did not do enough for me to care about these characters.
my favorite part was when supervillain galadriel dragged secret!sauron back into the darkness as he was legitimately trying to repent and be good  maybe. even better  this isn t a  my favorite part  ridiculous continuity change joke  it actually happens in the show!
please watch episode 7 when it comes out  we really need you to take one for the team  appreciate your suffering
its the full circle conundrum... when things are so bad  they become entertaining
my friend  just the intro of your video make me laugh  in a few seconds you gave us your precise point of view.
Im confused how accurate guyladreil was to knowing which town out of all of the southlands in middle earth where the orcs were going to be.Im no doctor  but if bronwyn was bleeding out that much then the arrow has pierced either the subclavian artery or vein. burning the wound externally would not stop the internal bleeding. bronwyn should be pepsi.how did halbrand get ahead of oren  was he just running around in circles  Imean  guyladriel gave her horse her karen powers to run faster  but halbrand still got ahead of them.then lastly... how did hobo steal the hilt under guard so many questions...
8 25 I believe you are not missing anything! its the writers who are. each of them a brain.
I have not been able to bring myself to watch the series yet  I remember being excited when the show was announced thinking we would get a cool new entry for the world tolkien created. then they started to describe and show off what they were creating  it pretty much went downhill from there.
I was just about to say the same melonie  isn t this whole show about galadriel s    cuse me  strong woman   revenge  oh and calling her discount arwen is an insult to that character. they at least showed arwen using magic. they made strong woman the equivalent on a malee dps.
karendriel training the supposed giga chad numenoreons is lol af
the best part of this series was all those crazy comments on youtube mixing up franchises and stories etc lol
I belong to a forum where many people activity loved this episode.  I just do not get it  poor writing  plot holes  contrivances  magic teleporting  and mystery boxing drive me absolutely crazy.  but they are either excepting all those things  or just distracted by the spectacle  it does look pretty at times  and expensive at times .
you said it well. there s no passion because there s no vision.
do youremember the scenes in the desert from the rise of skywalker  it was filmed completely with green screen.. but then they remembered that they had too much money left and decided to set up the green screens in the desert and shoot there and when asked why  the answer came   because of the light   millions of dollers gone becourse of light xd it looks more like that film companies are a comedy show itself
I know the plan is to do five seasons of that trash but after this  amazing  start I am willing to bet some money  that we will never see season 2 !amazon will bury the project and try to make us forget about it  but the memes are immortal !
someone need to explain me why they tought turning the most powerful high elf mage into a warrior was a good idea.
its almost like amazon didn t hire the best writers for this thing...
it was weird how it turned to daylight for some reason.  it took the orcs all night to break a door  alot of this in this ep makes no sense the more u think about it
its just this new form of entertainment from hollywood... interactive show. we are telling you a story that you  the audience has to fill in with anything you for yourself find believable to make our plot line work for you.
11 00 -  at least stuff happened this episode..  - true. the same cannot be said for the latest episode of  she-hulk ... or the one before that... and the one before that...
its not confirmed yet  but most of the rest of that leak already came true. plus the leak said the reveal is in the season finale.
exactly my brother
taking a stab at it.I think it is because it is harder to portray magic normally for a tv show because of budget constraints.and they wanted to follow her. however this show does not have that problem so I do not know.
its almost like they ghosted peter jackson
you mean to tell me halbrand didn t look at discount aeoweyn and say  you dont know what I know....   to which she responds   you still haven t seen what Ive seen...  resulting them staring at eachother until they forget that tolkien created this world  shocking...
my favorite part was right before the battle  when adar looked at the camera and said  its morbin time
tell me if im wrong  but how does galadriel and the numenoriens know where to ride for  they just get of the boat and knows exactly where there is a fight going on
ill watch any fantasy movie  b movie  c movie. nothing in this show makes sense  but adar  mordor and the orc plotline are gorgeous. there is some good in this show  I think a team did the mordor stuff.
what about the fact that noone checked if it was the sword galadriel tok from adar
one does not simply walk into a pyroclastic flow.  unless they re galadriel apparently
so this sword that we have been watching for episodes was simply a ridiculously overcomplicated way to make the volcano erupt  and adars whole plan was to make day to night by erupting the volcano
I love military history things  and the stone fortress with a single defensible gate is where the royals and noble Lords would rule.  in ancient history  whenever a royal or Lord moved into a community  they would put up a wooden fortress on a hilltop  in order to defend against angry local people.  and then  as the situation demanded  build a stone castle  not always  it could be a wooden defensive structure  where the famous habsburgs  who ruled europe for about 600-years  had stone castles  but they are expensive  so they had many wooden structures that disappeared with time .  the standard castle design is an inner keep for the nobles and knights  a small village thatsurrounds it of respected  skilled craftsmen and stables  if they are not here  they are just outside the first castle wall that is around the keep   likely a field for gardens  and an outer wall surrounding the keep  and sometimes another wall surrounding an inner city outside of the keep castle walls  trophy houses of the Lords might not have walls at all  and only the keep  and everything else is outside with a nearby village .  stone fortresses became less popular when cannon was invented  because they could breach the stone walls.  this created elaborate fortresses run by military professionals  in order to handle modern cannon sieges.  the last time a fortress was built in america was by the famous robert e. lee  who was an engineer and west point graduate  in the antebellum south  and it is named fort pulaski.  what happened is in the u.s. civil war more developments for artillery happened than any time in world history  breach loading artillery came into being  that is much more effective than cannon ball artillery.  from then on  fortresses made of stone are useless  because modern artillery ruins them  and now all american military bases are surrounded by chain-linked fence with military police watching over it.  there are a few exceptions  where a stone wall is erected  but not for defensive purposes  that is to keep spying eyes away. in conclusion  to abandon a stone fortress of ancient times by the nobles means they dont know anything about war  and they didn t care for their safety from their own community that they rule over.
sauron should have been the one who erupt mount doom with his powers. the mountain is controled by sauron and get dormant when sauron is weak or defeated. also orcs cant even think to turn on the dark Lord sauron
watch the part where isildur feeds an apple to the horse. violently pushes face  cheesy sound effect  pulls apple out unchanged.  1 billion everybody.
discount eowyn just sorta forgets thatshe herself is on a quest for revenge  she said herself she literally cant stop fighting. what even is this show
@melonie mac go boom Im still trying to work out how thatsingle fire arrow cut or burnt through that rope so quickly that it was weak enough to snap   . and setting up that tower trap would of taken days   . also the fact a blacksmith was making a sword in a day . .  it took 1-2 days to make a poor-average iron sword in a smithy that was capable of making swords  a blacksmiths wouldn t be capable of that most swords would take 1-6 months to make depending on the quality they wanted  and with the elves checking to see if the knives were too sharp no way a proper forge would be in that village  and how the f did the numenorions know that particular village was being attacked to save them  and charging their horses from so far away they should of been dead     oh God how did bronwyn get up so quickly from that nearly loosing all her blood experience  what I cant believe is that halbrand  managed to stop his spear thrust mid swing with the call from galadriel like no way he could of stopped that unless he was already stopping. but my biggest question is how did halbrand from way behind managed to nto only catch up to galadriel and alanor  but over take them enough for him to charge him head on in a case of chicken
she only took 2 arrows. we know that third arrow is the killer.
I think this settles the last uncertainty I had about rop. are the battle sequences good apparently not.
that 1st shot of that orc  I noticed he made a face   my dog stepped on a bee  face
they should listen to bronwyn as their doctor  herbalist - about healing and aprovisation and such - but they should chose from them some old soldier who seen war as advisor about war
unpopular opinion  galadriel in this show is the path to salvation for the writers. she is an awful character  but they seem to have the seeds of improvement planted. as bad as the show is  I still have some hope they will redeem her in the end.
discount eowyn.
this show just continues to amaze me. the complete lack of logic blows me away. one thing I noticed  one of many  is how in the earlier episodes itseemed like they were trying to not show blood on screen   I figured it was because they were aiming for a younger audience  but this episode had so much blood. and they like focused on it! this show is all over the fucking place  its wild!
look  galadriel is actually on a high horse.
hooray! please send it to my grandma and lil red will go grab it for me.
I sometimes watch thatshow forged in fire on the history channel ..... and it takes dudes with modern equipment hours just to make a sword that is really low quality. and they give them a week to make one that is declared the winner .... in this show dudes are producing swords like they have replicator technology.
@todd taylor  indeed  like a steel sword for a king could take a master weaponsmith upto 6 months to make   getting all the impurities out of the steal and making sure each step is done well  and a simple blacksmith from the southlands can make several without experience in a day
ign gave this show a 10 10. I want to know what version they watched.
if adar wasn t an elf  it would be easier to stomach his character. make him a black numenorian one of the king s men or something.
there s a reason why  galadriel often sits like that ...she taking a crap on the fan base!
future episode leak - guyladriel crosses paths with the hairryfuts and they like  our kween!  and they pledge to follow her - guyladriel loves the attention and gets on her horse - makes it rear for that dramatic pose and puts her hands up dual wielding 2 giant two handed swords - and then screams - follow me - leave the weak behind! she digs her spurs into the horses side and charges away and the hairyfuts try to follow running comically with their short stature.  speaking of harfoots - when lenny is talking to the girl harfoot he looks like a giant - 2x her hieght... jeez... they couldnt make them all the same hieght - it breaks the immersion of the hairyfuts being what they are small....  lenny henry is 6foot 2inches 1.9 meters  elanor brandyfoot pplayed by markella kavenagh is 5 3  in centimeters  166 cm. in meters  1.6 m. is around 5 feet 3 inches and itshows since the creators couldnt be arsed to do anything about it.
I haven t seen this show yet  but itsounds like the mission was to create some sort of clown middle earth show...
maybe we re just looking at this show through the wrong lens. maybe its a naked gun like spoof of lotr  which would make sense after watching that fight training scene. if the entire shows like that it could be a comedic masterpiece.
if you started a drinking game where you took a shot every time someone on this show did something stupid  you would ve died by alcohol poisoning by the time the 1st episode ended.
2 arrows in bronwyn  removed one then the other magically disappeared.
when even mainstream publications like forbes are talking shit about a show  its in big trouble. Im still convinced that this whole debacle is a money laundering scheme for all the executives.
when you seek wokeness you shall achieve brokeness!
rings of power. the history of a friendly orc people threatened by a monster tiranic human named psico galadriel.
who knew that mount doom was a dehydrated volcano  who would have guessed that all that you had to do was add water
7 31       dont play in the   m  u  d  d  l  e  d     you ll get a  dirty mind.
if you look up youtube videos on tolkien lore  yourealize there s a lot of shit goin on in all parts of middle earth and beyond that is so interesting but they dont touch upon it in rings of power. the stuff with harad and rhun is super interesting w  diverse regions of middle earth but I imagine amazon will pretend it doesnt exist
only galadriel s revenge is of any consequence. and also  this is the show of unbelievable coincidence. this episode s big coincidence  in all the southlands galadriel just happened to lead her tiny army right to where the orcs were just as the humans were about to be killed  and at night  it looked like  when  unless they knew they had to rescue people  they should have stopped to camp. I didn t watch the episode because they re so terrible  so am Imissing something that explains any of this     and I know they were just trying to do something tolkien did a number of times where a battle seems grim but just at the right time reinforcements arrive. the difference is  tolkien always had explanation of how these reinforcements knew where to go  and why they arrived when they did. this show relies on so much coincidence which is so lazy. sigh
so basically you can skip the first 5 episodes  sleeping  5 hours of sleep. a good nap  to watch the 6th episode
same with me and boredom  I had to split ep. 6 into 3 sittings. so much wasted potential for a decent show set in tolkien universe  and those cringe xena hercules style fight scenes...
thank you melonie   team
adar  an elf  serving a servant of morgoth.wouldn t happen.
@melonie mac go boom  Im glad you are there to watch this crap  so we dont have too.  I saw a meme that was basically  watching a bad show   no  listening to someone talk about a bad show   yes!
so igns not good at anything
better then the war this show started...
Im starting to believe wish version of princess warrior falls in love with dollar tree villain and heads straight to  oh no! he turned evil man bad!  bs...tolkien would die all over again I know I have and that due to the writing alone
I want to think the southerners may have abandoned the fortress because the tower was supported by a single rope  but I feel like thats giving the writers too much credit  considering everything else wrong with the show.
adar looks like data before technology evolved.
thatscene between bronwyn and miriel was a little cringe because bronwyn tried to play it humble by saying something about how she never looked to be a leader. didn t someone ask who put her in charge at the fort and she replied that them coming to the fort put her in charge  the writers are so inconsistent with their script and just want to push their themes like having a girl-boss moment.
calling it  boring  is being kind  -
theres a history channel docuseries with really good acting about rome vs barbarians. its at least 5 hours is really good. and to think its been not too long ago.
so youre telling me mt doom mordor came to be because galadriel failed to check the important item she chased the dude for. its like the writers hate her too lmao
an orc exploded from a sword hit by guyladriel.
I honestly thought this was the worst episode...  from the teleporting fleet magically showing up to the battle  to the battle itself  especially galadriel s comical horse-fighting scenes   to galadriel somehow able to survive the volcanic ash...yea okay...  the only plus side was no harfoots.
or in galadriels case a minImeme.
I enjoy your content. but I would love to see it evolve. you can do better than just your computer screen on the background
we had to destroy the village to save it. the numenoreans return to eventually defeat sauron and take him prisoner. galadriel is not a revenge seeking elven warrior.   where is celeborn through all this  the eventual Lord of lothlorien. galadriel s current husband. the one who with elrond and elvish remnants  from eregion get saved by the dwarves from khazad dum who help fight off sauron annatar.   shouldn t he be in here somewhere  with their daughter
isn t she married and have a kid in the lore.. plus she uses magic and was given a ring.. so we re just gonna remake her character
its depressing to see people on social media gushing over this episode because they ve seen 30 min of awful action and explosions
I guess yt deleted my first comment for some reason. great video. this show is just a dumpster fire  lol. thanks for watching so I dont have to. I went ahead and followed that twitter account.
a lot of commentators are calling her  guyladriel  and Im inclined to agree  because its certainly accurate.  muddy water will not quench your thirst  ! oh  please. that is just horrific writing. of course halbrand has to stan her  she is the bestest evar. a female friend of mine tried telling me  oh she has to prove herself as a military leader to get anywhere and you need to reexamine your idea of femininity   and I just kinda looked at her thinking  riiiiight...I cant talk to you about anything  here.  hot garbage is hot garbage.
its definitely way better then she hulk     they are getting better   let s see what happens in the next episode   it is getting interesting now   I think she s just wants to hate on the series   give it a chance   the video quality is actually very good   it does have good lighting   cool graphic special effects   its actually little above watchable   I give it a 7. 5   its definitely not boring   it does have action sequences
writers when talking to the media  we know tolkien despised allegory  writers back at the their writing desk    ..fuck it
Im convinced the 1 billion dollars spent on this is some sort of payment from something completely different.  yeah  I ll give you a billion dollars  but just produce some bs with a tiny part of it.
sponge bob  yay  we saved the town
I like that they chase him down .... get his doodad and in the end were just going to give it to a kid .......... a kid that already seemed like he was 40 60  evil good  lol.
what do you expect from consoomers
wait till you see the chicks begging to see a scene of halbrand and galadriel kissingI bet they ll be soooo surprised when suddenly  out of nowhere and with zero foreshadowing  halbrand suddenly turns out to be sauron all along. oh the horror
bot accounts
cant wait to see what a cooked guyladriel looks in that damn metal armour after face tanking a volcano fml...
I think durin would fit in with the lotr world.
this show is basically a live action loony toons cartoon!
rings of power is decent popcorn entertainment. but thats probably not what amazon was going for.
discount  owyn
the best thing about the story was kept out   we are supposed to believe that no one is looking up what oren had carried with him. even arondir didn t care even he had send galadriel after oren because of the hilt. rings of boredom is written so poorly that its hard to watch a whole episode. but the village fight was probably the most dumb thing Ive seen so far. and where did they find the actors playing the uruk  at a larp event  but a bad one to be fair. probably most larpers would have done a better job.
itseems like gadriel is the baddy.  moroth  er  adar I guess Imean  I dont know what is going on lol  is far more sympathetic. there are some pretty great actors doing the best with the  script     it d be better ad libbed
why does adar look like the bad guy in the most recent pirates of the caribbean movie
the whole galadriel  training  n men rean soldiers is beyond upsetting. they re warriors of old.
melonie change the ending music lol its such a hard transition from a lot of these topics. just my suggestion opinion its not a huge deal lol. great video!
the actor who played oren  I think thats the name  the lead orc  is just a good actor. check out ripper street to see him in action with a decent script    also  english  which is always a plus in general for actors    the original star wars trilogy benefited from a big cast of english actors  one factor that really made them exceptional movies. not a massive fan of this show so far  average at best.
elvish presleyfied hairdoes required the noldor to hide an entire hair spray factories smokestack from the ents in lindon by some really powerful magic.
its actually hilarious. 1 bln dollar production and everyone is discount xd like what the actual f... xd
volcanic ash devouring everything.guyladriel  there is a tempest in me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!volcanic ash
it was a fight of there spiritshe was just trying not to be pushed to far to the darkness duhh lol
2 b  budget   500 million actual spending in vfx and other stuff and 1.5 million to pay people to cheer each episode.
this is the most watched show for all the wrong reasons.so many have prime  so are willing to watch just to see how bad it can get.
she was not consumed 100  I bet she comes out of the fire like iron man lol
yep  you are missing something  a very clever and competent written tv show  about the iconic fantasy novel  master of the squares   made by a big corporation called nozama in a universe parallel to ours... we all missing that...
06 01 lol discount eowyn!!! nice!
lol I actually like adar. him and halbrand are the only good characters  everyone else is either boring or insufferable
when a show reflects the modern world  there is no fantasy   no escape  it just becomes woke crap.
it was the funniest episode. skipped about 20  of the ep as it was boring as hell and nothing happened! however if can only mention one thing it was elf woman only using attacks on horse if she was sliding on her back!
news from insider  amazon analyst said he  fell asleep  watching the company s lotr  rings of power  tv show  making him even more worried the  1 billion project may be a bust
yep a true fan of tolkien.
I wonder if this person actually saw the very beginning of lotr series
do you think its a coincidence that the people thatseem like they would actually fit in a lotr show are both bad guys ..at least most likely.
they have made galadriel an indestructible warrior princess with every single skill under the sun   it has turned into a comedy! but she couldn t sense that the sword is missing from the pouch. amazing bronwyn recovered from the deep wounds in a couple of hrs.  all glammed up in the feast. me too nonsense is ruining the ridiculous plotline  galadriel and co. I will walk away from this unsurvivable catastrophe without a scratch. galadriel tells hal to move on from his past  why aren t you doing the same thing  practise what you preach! avenging her brother s death  a brother that has already been reincarnated in valinor. nothing makes sense  you suck payne and mckay!
this channel is a giant meme
Im fine watching the video game cutscenes of someone playing a middle earth game with a female elf warrior and their ultra rare galadriel avatar  and then max d out the renegade stats on all their female characters
the raw meat of power
galadriel gets humbled by chad  sauron halbrand . they re literally writing out a feminist tiltok channel
wait... dude expresses romantic feelings for galadriel and she reciprocates   at this point in the timeline  she s been married to celeborn for centuries...
7 30 she is  being sarcastic comparing her to eowyn cuz she whas the empowered woman in lotr
guyladriel is bestest tank ever. can face tank an 800 degree c ash cloud. many epic such wow
its actually a parody
I just imagine its directed by sam rami.  so hammy like army of darkness and the quality of xena.  just no more dwarven sex jokes please yeesh
episode 6 of the rings of power delivers exceptional action and character development in a high-stakes hour that reveals adar s grand plan. this is fantasy television at its best  a gorgeous emotional rollercoaster that ends with an enormous blow to the heroes.
rings of pride!
medieval fantasy s genre .... doesnt need to be fixed to reflect the modern world ... the whole point is .... medieval .. fantasy
awesome video
brace yourself for this  but I dont think this show let tolkien s writings get in the way of the story it wanted to tell.
@matthew mosier  the people writing this probably had to be told oompa loompas aren t from tolkien s world.
@todd taylor  you could be right. this show is garbage  but people need to stop assuming that it was done with any interest at all in the source material. this show is an attempted assassination of tolkien s influence on western culture. not his writings  they likely dont care much about those  this is cultural undermining. its like when a restorer defaces a painting of Jesus and everybody just assumes it was an unskilled person who accidentally did a horrific job on 100  of a historic piece before figuring out that it wasn t working. yeah... sometimes people do things purposefully to try and damage the emotions connected to objects or ideas. in the case of rop they likely want people to be disgusted and to stop liking tolkien. you say Im crazy  but Im not the one trying to convince you that jeff bezos allowed amatures to be the main voices behind a 1 billion dollar investment and never had what they were doing checked in on with test audiences. try buying a house for even  100 000... the bank will want receipts for your receipts. Im sorry.. there s just no way this all happened totally by accident.
this show would have been so much better if galadrikaren had been wearing that armor when she jumped off the boat in the first episode.  and somebody needs to get her actress some metamucil - she s had the same pinched expression on her face the entire series.  girl needs some fiber.
I just wanna convert rings of power into brutal doomguy canon fodder enemy replacement .pk3 scrip   go on a woke killing rampage.
at least galadriel was burnt to ashes after being swallowed up by a blast from a volcano that has several hundred thousand degrees of temperature right  right
I watched the first two episodes  then I was like Im gonna wait to binge   and then just listen to all the disgruntled fans along the way. though  is the meteor man  robert townsend  in a giant white man suit  thats all I wanna know.
agree. a total cash grab. reflect the world as it is  ditch the show and report the news. another fun video! keep up the great work!
this show should be called the rings of karen.
I have to disagree about the chemistry between the elf and the single mom...that dude is like a block of wood  and I cant buy their feelings for one another at all.
its okay when I do it .
the modern world is so cringe that I enjoy watching people dunking modern entertainment over watching it. ironic.
discount eowyn
it was so brave and stunning to see again the rohirri...-sorry  the seaguys charging from the rising sun.  pity the fight is in the opposite direction!
I think that episode 6 was the shit  the battle was just ridiculous. I honestly ejoyed the previous episodes which focused more on politics even though people think they re boring  probably because they have the attention span of a child. but the thing that made me yell to the tv was galadriel wearing her armor on the boat  so that if itsunk she would have drowned in a few seconds. I hate their lack of attention to details  Im not even talking lore here  its just sloppiness.
good Lord melonie mac!lol
this show is so bad it hurts my brain... they just dont seem to give a shit. abandoning a fortress to go back to take shelter in a completely open village  a watchtower thats held together by one rope. bronwyn getting shot by two arrows but in the next scene inside the tavern there s only one stuck in her. halbrand teleporting in front of adar in the woods while galadriel had to use elven speech  in a direct rip-off of arwen from jackson s trilogy  to keep up... and thatsword hilt macguffin thats even worse than that idiotic dagger in rise of skywalker that relies on contrivance after contrivance for the end goal of making a freaking volcano erupt. peak level lunacy.I ll never understand how such rank amateurs who couldn t write a cohesive story to save their lives got to lead a billion dollar production set in one of the most beloved fantasy worlds ever created. this whole thing just has to be a money laundering scheme...
orcs only wants a home. psico galadriel  leave them alone!!!
tweet is on point
didn t amazon pay  250m for the rights to the source material.... only to then totally ignore the source material  interesting strategy.
didn t bronwyn get shot twice with arrows  they only.showed one arrow being removed
rings of boredom is nothing more than a parasite living off a legendary story.stepping on a dogs turd whilst being bare foot would be more entertaining and fun.
hey melonie mac go boom  is that japanese language tattoo on your left arm  dose thatsay Godzilla  if so thats awesome
the cringe of power.
the cherry on top can be the best part of a sundae made of crisco topped with shaving cream drizzled with exlax chocolate too. does that make it good  no. same as one somewhat passable episode does not make up for a total trash show.
what is it with guyladriel constantly running ahead of everyone with her horse without a advance guard clearing the way for her  by now her running around as if she was horse racing on a farm would have gotten her an arrow in her heart  throat or lungs by now. horsemen are notoriously easy targets for bowman. orcs have a evil reputation for being excellent marksman with their bow and arrrows. remember poor boromir. guyladriel the girl barbarian is getting tiring and obnoxious to watch.
there is a tempest in me!!!!
my favorite part was where galadriel yelled  this! is! lothlorien!  and kicked sauron into a giant hole
I dont know how you do it mel. it just gives me a headache. best wishes.
stop criticising it!!its the funniest show on tv at the moment. I haven t laughed so hard in the last five years
just because there s a wacky volcano explosion and a battle doesnt make a series great  the special effects dont help when the script and acting are bad and the choreography of a fight looks like game of throne when jaime lannister fights in dorne. .. gosh  thats horrible  just like rop.ps  my favorite part was where karen sue say nothing and do nothing and nothing change in the show.
there is  lasagna inside me
first episode that made me care. Im starting to like the show
discount eoywn.....I like it.
melonie  I have no idea how you have the strength to watch this series. I only saw clips from nerdrotic  and I felt intense physical pain. good Lord  they destroyed galadriel...and they think this is empowerment  people who genuinely like this  are terrifying to me  because now Ive seen how many people lack soul or imagination...fuck it  they lack both. the numbers of them  actually terrify me. Imean  its not much of a number  but its making me lose more faith in humanity. though  you  and the fandom menace are the folks that I have faith in. I just hope you show the same love for my works  as you do with the old tomb raider games  and that Ive earned it.
I can understand they didn t want to basically do a helms deep rip off with a fortress besieged  but what they came up with was just moronic.
the kingdom of merch lore
tune in next week as the show explains how everyone at  ground zero  of mt. doom s eruption survives.
go boom!! I order you to go boom  dammit!!!!
how is it the best episode  though  xd to me  it just seems like every episode is dumber than the last because the stupidity just keeps building up. in this episode we learn that guyladriel is a bigger villain than sauron  and that orcs have preferred pronouns.
these lines that are intended to sound thought provoking and amazing just straight up sound like wannabe poets in high school
so how much of the show do you actually watch and how much is told to you before you make your videos so itseems like you have watched an episode
I thought the hobbit movies had some badly written unequal battles  like the group op unarmored peasant wives and elderly widdows fighting off the massive horde of armed and armored orcs who have been training for years  while they are armed with a few pitchforks and rolling pins  and not losing a single human  meaning they were more effective than the massive dwarven army and the elven army. this one is right up there  and it doesnt have a good sense of humor  likable cast or excelent camerawork to compensate.also  that  dont quench your thirst with muddy water.  phrase might be semi-legit. because I for sure would stop what I was doing while trying to parse how thatstatement in any way connected to the current situation.but elves wanting revenge more than humans  when elves verifiably reincarnate but humans stay dead...that is the worst hipocrisy.
in the books she s married...
I guess because I got some unintended laughs and didn t fall asleep
@melonie mac go boom  I got the best laughs out of this show when guyladriel was riding the horse in slo mo. the only reason Im watching is because I want something so colossally stupid it tops that. and the vistas are pretty good  Im assuming thats where a lot of the money went .
this episode made me realize the orcs are actually the good guys.  think about it  the orcs just want somewhere to live in peace   just as worthy of the breath of life  just as worthy of a home  meanwhile you ve got this racist  genocidal  elven commander who wants to wipe out every single orc.  your kind was a mistake... and even if it takes me all of this age I vow to eradicate every last one of you  - galadriel.do the writers not know what they re doing
hate watching makes woke crap fun. just watch it with a bunch of non-woke friends and make fun of every cringe scene!
how do I give a review for this I paid for a year of prime but cant find the rating section
this show is awesome. youre just trying to fit in and sound cool by hating on it.
I ll just had this pop up on my suggestion page I almost feel out of the know that I dont know every like minded youtuber
the  most expensive series evah    allegedly    and what did we got 25 minutes of mediocre action  with karendriel doing wire-fu like if this is 2002 or something  doggy cgI and  epic battle scenes  of armies that consisted of maybe 30-50 extras.hell  xena- warrior princess had battle scenes with  large armies  that looked more epic in scope  back in the 90 s and with a fraction of the   alleged   budget that this dumpsterfire has.not to mention xena had also better writing.
I d honestly be embarrassed if I was a woman if this show was meant to represent and empower me. this show is the biggest let down in tv history.
it going to be better forever. this rings of power its epic bad. its open the road for the best jrr tolkien story.
hilarious rendition of the travesty that is  rings of fire  .
is this leading to cheetos dust galadriel
God we need more women like you in the world. thank you for having some common sense and an actual self-thinking  rational mind.
the whole stunt with collapsing the tower by breaking a single rope thatsurrounds the tower is beyond stupid.
the show might as well be a big as hell dumb meme at this point. each freaking character says one thing but does another instead every damn time! the writers of this show dont know how to stay consistant at all.
the first page of the fellowship of the ring was more interesting than this entire bad attempt at a tv show has been. this series is not tolkien lore and canon. its a joke.
rings of power or hemorrhoids
the writers grew up on world of warcraft  and think they like tolkien because thats where the orcs and elves come from originally  without seemingly knowing that they re not the same.
I got bored every episode  pulled switchoru out and played metroid dread or super castlevania 4. I cant help it  its so boring
discount arwen even rips off real arwen when she speaks to her horse  in much the same voice liv tyler used  to boost the horse s speed  like real arwen did when escaping the nazg l in the lotr trilogy...complete ripoff! and this without establishing she has any magical traits thus far. and...lol...all for nothing because halbrand  even though he leaves much later then adar and galadriel  manages to flank them both even though both are galloping at the utmost highest speed both horses can achieve  even with discount arwen s magical boost! smh.unfortunately  even the  queens praising each other  scene fails. the queen regent commends bronwyn saying  no  bronwyn was the one who saved her people  for which bronwyn replies   a burden I never sought to take up   and the regent responds   few of the finest leaders do . acknowledging bronwyn is a good leader. the queen regent then turns around and hands the kingdom of men over to an unknown blacksmith who could have pilfered his pendant off of anyone with scant proof of who he is! good job queen regent  good job! way to diminish bronwyn s agency and hand the lands back to definitely not sauron!another note that was brought up elsewhere  the pyroclastic cloud coming off of a volcano  containing rock fragments  super heated gas and ash  reaches temperatures of 800 c and speeds of up to 440mph  700kph  and galadriel just stands there like its merely a cloud of smoke. pompeiI  anyone
this show is basically the modern day the room except 100  worse
I love this show. I love middlearth. I dont understand why so many people hates this epic show
funny  the yt as coming in was for rop... un-skippable.
and more believable characters
that would be the only reason I would watch any of this series.   and if she dusts off her fingers on her armor...
really  you must not know anything about middle earth to make thatstatement. anybody that defends this show never read tolkien s works or read it with hate for tolkien.
@alejandro molina  Ive read tolkien works  I love them  I love also jackson s movies and amazon series
unbelievable  how people praise this episode which is just the most stupid plot paired with kinda pretty but completely soulless and inconsistent content. and even though the last two seasons of got were aggravating and in many cases just as dumb  there was still much more love and care to be seen. to compare rop ep6 with something like helm s deep is insulting on so many levels.
when adar was talking to galadriel... saying the orcs deserve a place to live... galadriel says they should all die and I ll make you watch... thats basically genocide to holocaust levels.  adar says we prefer to be called uruks and galadriel says orc right after that... using the term as a racial slur now.  for a woke show  the symbolism is disturbing... why are you making it ok to stereotype a race as all evil and a  mistake  to rationalize killing them all indiscriminately.  Im sure there is a happy family of uruks out there staying away from battles and not participating in evil lol...  poor marginalized uruks!  then to say this show reflects the modern world... you have to wonder what agenda they re pushing.
average twitter representation! golden.
there are so many strong women! in this show  I cant tell which one is supposed to be the strongest!!!!!!!!!!!!!
why is a single rope holding up a tower of bricks
I have issues with it as well  but I have 2 points to make 1- your clearly fake laugh when critiquing gives off stuck-up vibes  so I cant take you seriously. and the  5 foot nothing  bit how tall is samwise gamgee  what was his job until he scored his first kill  you need more sophistication training to make compelling arguments with real points  and in-depth serious explanations.2- I have this annoying mentality that actually makes a good bit of sense  critique anything you want  but you best have a reasonable replacement idea ready in that moment or it is invalid.write episodes 1-6 with everything as you want it that makes sense to everyone else  or what good was your rant besides proving that younger millennials and low will whine about anything   92 here cursed with generational association
Im not saying rop is a money laundering scheme but I drove by an amazon warehouse and saw snuggles putting stacks of cash into suitcases.
love your hair style.
the water quote you couldn t remember was her saying  one does not quench their thirst by drinking salty sea water  in reference to not be so shortsighted in your anger in the moment when by holding back you can defeat even more evil than the one man. seems youre mocking the writing when it was actually you who couldn t keep up or interpret something beyond your comprehension that wasn t the fault of the dialogue  it was you.
they wanted to be even more inclusive w an asexual romance
I feel that the war in the ukraine could end if we send in guyladriel.
cancelled prime but not like I was going to watch rings of power anyway.
cool I love not doing what ever one else is doing. programming dahomeybu abk   all rights reserved
hello my sweet summer children.... oh wait  this is mel goes boom  not grey area! ! my bad
it was seawater wont quench your thirst
this is hells comedy they make the antI dante inferno
rings of power  more like rings of  progressivism
the writing in episode 6 is easily the worst so far. daylight here  night there  orcs getting beat up by farmers with sticks  numenorians get there on a magic carpet apparently  and someone texted them to tell them there was trouble that they couldnt possibly had known about. a giant orc with no sword  why didnt he have a sword  a fire that literally did nothing  the orc kicked over a stick and the way is clear  she jolts like getting hit by two arrows but only got hit by one  the sword is a key to open a dam  why dont they just break the dam  there isnt one redeeming quality in this garbage show.
morfydd s cute tho.
this only feels like the best episode because there was more action and less of the show s markedly atrocious dialogue. but even with that  the storytelling is going off the rails more than ever in terms of the lore  and there were still many profoundly stupid moments that made no sense. this show s writers should be fired and never work in the industry again.
good one.
you forgot the independent part. strong independent women. nod
really this show has some moments that are literally physics-type uncanny valley
no...it is pro demon propenganda.
if they fixed it for the modern world  where are the drones and smart phones
best episode so far  shill alert!
I thought it was going to be shit. it was shit. my expectations have not been subverted and I feel cheated.
the editing in ep 6 was weird and the sword plot line was dumb. it just opened a dam. the tunnels done all the works. so without the tunnels this secret ring knock of would of just spilt water down a valley.
they all were in 3 boats...with horses
the actors are responsible too. they could have noticed what a piece of crap they were making  torn up their contracts  and walked off the set. after all  they signed up for a tolkien show  and this is nothing of the kind.
@melonie mac go boom
hImelonie how s your day
where the horses come from they re were not on ship right the show is 4 10
muddy waters wouldn t clench your thirst    itseems you haven t heard  long distance call  or  I am the blues
wait... is that the blond chick from the witcher
I hold in painfull farts when around elf boys.
amazon just ruined aspiring actors careers by the dozens. no one really wants to see these faces in crappy plastics props again. everyone will just go  would not even made it through peter jacksons background actor casting  on them forever and feel the bad taste of vomit come up in the mind. it will be the meme show the survivors will be teased on late night tv in 20 years with as their early career sin.
God this show irritates me to the core. when it was first announced I lost my shit. I thought we may get some competent writers with the massive spending amazon had to pay to get thud up and running. we instead get..... this.
okay I think is this better then alot of tv shows right now  she-hulk is bad  alot of what disney have put out has not been good at all  same with thecw tv shows are now not that great  the problem is the writers for  tv show and I have to say even movies now are not good enough  and a lot of fans and after think there a right about what tolkien would want. I remember when Lord of the rings and the hobbit came out and people complained about them  people complain about disney s star wars movie and everything  it I have even heard people complain about the new game of thrones tv show  this is all what people do now is complain and think there know what a creator  if you dont like the tv show or movie or even a game dont watch it or play it.
rings of poo
amazon  the sea is always right.me  right about what  being stupid and ignorant
gret video you look awesome
hellbrand teleports infront out adar like fucken nightcrawler
11 16  look at guyladriel s back armor.   couldn t even bother to design something interesting    even a low level rpg or b movie wants to decorate a full suit of armor.  this goes to show they just phoned this whole thing in.
if this episode is the best... men these writers suuuck. you dont have six episodes to hook a person. you have depending on the person 1  2 or some say 3. but that is it. and with how long these episodes are it is far beyond any chance to draw in viewers. I write stuff  not published yet as much  but I know one thing you have to get the reader into the story very quickly. you dont have unlimited time to putter around.
to compare her to angelina is an insult.
I have regret now for talking shit about rey..I should ve saved the energy for galadriel s character in this farce
ruthless review
people are confused the elves did not build that tower remember those people served more goth that was probably an orc stronghold or a stronghold for servants or slaves of morgoth so you could say they had incompetent masonry it certainly wasn t numenoriannot to find in the show but people think the elves build this
this show is set to permanently end careers.
1 billion dollars.... where tf is the budget because I see they spend like less than 50 dollars on the writing.
its basically pretty looking boredom
I found halbrand galadriel more believable than bronwyn and arondir but both suck as couples anyway
amazon sringofpowersuxx
celeborn deserves better.
grl u a trip
yay another drinking game for a bad show
it just ain t Lord of the rings. its not. also I dont mean to sound like a simp but love the hair. looks adorable.
hImelonie I wanted wish you to have wonderful joyful weekend  I always enjoy listening to your thoughts.takecare melonie
rings of power is a giant dumpster fire
man  what a strong female character am I right  staring into a bursting volcano with all the chaos going around her  unfazed.didn t give single a flying fuck about the injured  the poor children  the woman who s too weak to run after fighting the uruks all night.even the african queen  who didn t join her men in battle  helped some woman escape.galadriel  fuck no. Imma just staring acting like a cool bitch at all times! bam! shock wave in the face  but we all know thatshe s not dead.
calvary arrived in the nick of time so its ripping off game of thrones just like bezos wanted off topic are you going to do a video on the tua hit last night
why didn t they the eagles
with putin invading
before  doom 2 becomes history accurate
is guyladriel dead
I dont understand why there s so much bad and lazy writing when so much money is being spent.
lolz
I didn t see anything of rings of power. is sharknado better than this
I really wanted to watch a good show but this is a travesty
galacaughtlying
if you hate these shoes so much why do you watch them
you tubers are giving this show too much attention. it doesnt deserve your time.
amazon has no soul. just like its founder.
remember the Lord of the rings trilogy  maybe it has the same screen time as the rings of power. wasn t it about good v evil  friendship from dwarfs and elves and hope. ...yeah! well fuck that ! we have   modern update   . the rings of woke. placing 2022 politics into a novelist born in another centuary   based on a mythical england ....okay
hI jodie foster lookalike for role of young guyladriel much
Lord of the meme s the rings of wokedom sucks ty for watching so I dont have to.
vote sauron adar 2022
this show lacks masculine energy
2 16     why is bronwyin the leader of the village  good question! because feminism. ofc it makes no sense and never rwould happen in real human life  but these are the time we must live in
they try way too hard with diversity and strong women.
the latest episode was almost unwatchable. none of it is believable  absolutely none of it. and the music  good gawd the music. I hate how they try to use it to elicitsome sort of feeling in the audience. it has the exact opposite effect. just horrible.
youre prettier than her
yeah how dare we want to have fantasy in our fantasy and not any real world issues. shame. rings bell
imagin someone fell in love with something therefore the producers have to change it. I simply dont get it why woman have to be in everything superior to man  Imean nobody buys it. raw physical streanth is a male forte  with the same trainig a woman probuablly never wins. woman have to be more cunning and  tricky in battle  eaven if wepons are equilizers. you have to ask every female wich practices hema.
honestly I find this episode more irritating than the rest  sure the rest was boring but at least it had some sort of continuity and common sense but this one was unbearable to watch
Im rooting for the uruks.  orc is a triggering word.  freedom for the uruk!!!
best
dont know why all female streamers are having the  extra  eye line make-up thing going from the eye and half way out on the cheek.how old are you
ign gave it 10 out of 10   wtf. lol what a joke. they must be paid by amazon because if thats 10... two towers is 100 out of 10.  here s my issue. the action was good but I dont care about any characters. there s no connection to the story for me. its all pointless because I dont like any of the good characters.  adar is the best actor in this entire show I will say that along with the guy who will be sauron soon. cough we all know its coming.  halbrant will turn into the dark Lord probably because of galadriel turning him down or some lame crap like that
you know what happened in the middle-age europe when the attackers came  every single person packed their things and tried to get to the fortress or within the city walls asap. the fortress or walls of any given city in the middle-ages were build for these purposes. to protect the people around it. at least they tried to. to be in the open as a peasent when attackers come means certain death. and orcs  well  they are extremely brutal... and... they are not even human so you  as a human  means absolutely nothing to them  therefore there will be no mercy when they come. everyone who is not a member of an army will flee at sight when an orc army comes into view  in fact they flee at the first mention that an orc army is underway so the villages will be already empty when the enemy army arrives . itseems that the creators of rings of power never ever saw a documentary or read something about the life or meaning of a middle-age setting  in which lott is clearly in . you know... we should not be so judging about the writers and producers of the show... they are just lazy and incompetent and they cannot do a better job above their level  which is  apparently  very low . the main fault lies in the persons who actually hired them.
biracial angelina jolie
this show is garbage and its just getting worse. how the heck does itstill have such high ratings on imdb  the ratings have basically been frozen now for 2-3 weeks with the pre-approved and scrubbed reviews and they re not accepting new ones.
show not for add millennials. I honestly dont know what show have all of been watching.
I was so excited for this show initially  and am so disappointed with this turd of a show.
it is pathetic
you can get away with woke propaganda if the content is atleast exciting. rop biggest sin is that its just boring af
pfft Im not listening to a woman on this matter.
the sea told me this show sucks
my God  the cringe
why cant they just make a normal show and make it art without modifying every small detail to reflect the ideologs of liberal dogmatics.  if you want to make money  not offend anyone  and make everybody happy just tell the story as it was told.  dont add in todays social cliches .
I dont how this disaster is the  best  episode. its just another sleeping pill of bad writing and cringe.
morfydd clark is a very bad actor hence the no chemistry.
she is supposed to be married to calaborn. their breaking canon
people forget that galadriel is married so is cool to cheat when you are a karen
read tolkien s letter in the silmarilion or whatever you call it. even the letter is a beautifully written masterpiece. a letter. thats tolkien s greatness that amazon has decided to basterdize.the 3 big events in the second age are  forging the rings  fall of numenor and the defeat of sauron.will the amazon writers be able to pull it off
its the worst episode so far by a mile.I was holding out and almost enjoying 1-5 but the amateurish editing  script  pseudo thespian shakespearian dialogue has me done.did my best bu hate it!!!
if youre going to use my gimmick and record your tv from your phone at least do it right. dont be a boomer and record it in portrait mode instead of landscape mode.
trying to rack up a quick buck with the hate bandwagon  like all other  review  channel  bruh....
God this commentary sucks.
adar -  orcs are people too  except for the lighter skinned caucasian looking ones  propaganda   -p
maybe people actually dont like the show  weird  huh  bruh
