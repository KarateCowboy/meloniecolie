I think morbius is a cool character and I like the vampire theme but I dont think he s a strong enough character for his own movie. should have been introduced in the  blade  films or in  spider-man . Im also a fan of the beckinsale  underworld  franchise.
I had an abusive mom  but I still respected her for the situation she was in  thatshe gave me birth  and fed  even if not enough  and housed me until I became an adult.  disrespect of others is to disrespect who you are in many ways.
milo didn t just turn villain  he flipped when he was a kid- being bullied... and morbius didn t kill anyone he had been working with for years... that was milo.they did focus the movie on morbius  inner conflict...as a morbius fan  I enjoyed what they did.
thats so sad about the morbius movie!  I thought it looked rather good  and this coming from a person who doesnt really like the whole vampire thing .   it would have been so good if they made the theme of the movie about self-control  like you said!  we really do need a message like that today.so refreshing to hear somebody talk about obeying honoring parents and about the importance on being modest!  keep up the good work melonie!  youre a blessing to us!
your morbius review was on point about everything  from the morality of the characters  and self control between the duality of his humanity and monster side. sounds like you should have been the writer of this movie...maybe it would have been a decent hit in the theaters.
I have a soft spot for the vampire genre and really wanted this to be good. Imean  I even liked byzantium. what a shame.your take on excess  addiction etc. was like a breath of fresh air coming from a young person.
hey melonie  this was a really good review. you obviously understand storytelling very well  because your solutions to the problem sound like they d work wonderfully!
I love your channel melonie. I remember the days of seeing you on the screens in my local game stop. I am happy you are finding a home on youtube. bless you girl.
morbius is one of those characters who had an interesting concept but didn t have people to write him a good story atleast enough for books to sell. his high point was in the 90s where he fought against blade and spider-man and in the spider-man animated series. but outside of that he didn t have an intriguing story solo wise when it came to comics. I would consider morbius a cult favorite comic book character to those who are a fan of morbius and have read his comics since day 1
I loved the first underworld too. I like a lot of different vampire and werewolf movies. my favorite of each is interview with a vampire  and american werewolf in london.
a couple of favorite vampire movies of mine are metamorphosis and manhattan undead.  metamorphosis stars highlander s Christopher lambert.  I dont know anyone in manhattan undead  but it was a really good drama.
the original underworld was so awesome. I still have an oldschool movie poster from pre-release for that one. the sequels lost a bit of the appeal  as most movie series do. another great vampire related anime manga is the hellsing ip. many people will say to skip the 2001 original   only watch hellsing ultimate  but the first series was what I was introduced to back in the day and I have fond memories of it. ultimate came out much later when the manga was closer to finishing its run  so it follows that a lot more closely. they re both pretty awesome.
I have to admit  Im a victim of almost all the destructive vices you mentioned. but I cant deny the destructiveness of them. and I cant blame other people for  repressing  me. all my faults are due to my own choices and just because I dont have the willpower to fix myself doesnt give me the right to demand that others pretend that they re healthy and acceptable.
out of all the villains in spider-man s rogues gallery  morbius was the last one I wanted to see on-screen. bring on a kraven the hunter movie.
thanks for not sugar coating your review on this. great breakdowns for journalism in general. also  your outfit messages   workout encouragement .
this film emphasises what a lot of people in our sphere need to recognise. just because something isn t woke  doesnt mean it will be good. haven t seen morbius so maybe Im giving it a hard time but from what Ive heard its really bad.
you may be my spirit animal..love the underworld series also and have been reading the reviews on this and said to myself it cant be that bad but you ve saved me from vamp disappointment!
Im a recovered alcoholic  tobacco smoker  binge eater  and p0rnography addict.  sober since august of 2018 and I get hostile with anyone trying to push or persuade me to go back to that junk. I cant even be in a pub without feeling sick. I love eating and drinking right  staying focused on Jesus Christ  and working out five to six days a week. I feel like batman.
Im happy that I have signed up to your channel melonie  keep going the way you are you will make 100k views in no time. I have given up tv shows and movies  and have started reading books instead  like the wheel of time  which is way better than the amazon series. furthermore  I personally think that the amazon Lord of the rings series is going to be a disaster. anne rice writes great vampire novels. I recently read the vampire lestat  he is a badass  and I enjoyed the book a lot. I am looking forward to reading queen of the damned  which is next in the series.
morbius was one of my fav characters next to ghost rider  vengeance  and moon knight  during the  rise of the midnight sons  story arc in marvel comics back in the early 90s  it was an awesome time in comic books. this movie turns my love of that character into such a travesty  I hope they do justice to moon knight and the supernatural side of marvel cinema moving forward or I really have to wash my hands of disney and fiege moving forward  I had to get a refund movie pass  should I go see batman  is it really better than batman begins  anyways thoughts  love the content  discussions and overall positivity! you kick ass!
only true marvel fans even know blade was a cannon member of the universe.good stuff
@the bl00d1u5t  is not was
sony really got way too far ahead of themselves this time. they should ve just done a new blade movie featuring michael morbius. that would ve made far more sense!
@revenge of the netherrealm  sony doesnt have the rights to blade
I fell asleep trying to watch it... an I tried multiple times. now I turn it on if I need to pass out.
it also can works in venom
hope youre doing ok.
full on agree. plus last year of disney marvel was worse.
that was the theme of the movie
@dan lance  oh  sorry  Imeant more along the lines of a deeper self-control story  like tokyo ghoul   instead of a surface level one.  thanks for the correction!
@a pebble master  I get what you mean. but you d be asking for a show run time not a movie run time.
or try to finish ultimate  but always end up watching the abridged again lol
please watch it for yourself. if I went by reviews  I would ve missed out. I thoroughly enjoyed it. definitely check it out for yourself.
welp that answers my question  now Im not gonna watch it. its sad that all they had to do was flesh out the story little more and it probably would have turned out better. but  your minI sermon towards the end was on point and I totally agree with your points. God is using you so well and Im glad I ran across your channel.
you are the first person  that I have heard  to ever mention that the new batman is your second fav behind the dark knight. that is literally my opinion too!! thank you. super random post but it got me excited hahahaha
I was half listening when you said corn addiction  at first I thought you were serious  then I thought Imisheard you  thanks for the review though. definitely wont be spending money on that. finally watched no way home. the last movie I saw before that was actually Godzilla vs kong and I totally agree. kong couldn t take mechazilla alone  he couldn t even beat Godzilla!
I really really really liked your message today about self control. thats an area that I need to work on. thank you for talking about that. God bless you and your family. duane.
self control is definitely key but it is so hard. I am diabetic and have been since my teens but my biggest weakness is sweets idk why I live them so much because its quite literally going to kill me
returnal was awesome  I really enjoyed it. I love movies games like the alien genre and returnal etc. what I dont like forced political messages propaganda in my entertainment. as long it feels natural and is a good story I will venture to say 99  of people will enjoy it and dont care. these people are just grifters just trying to drum up controversy in order to sell their  services  to  fix  a nonexistent problem. they are just ambulance chasing frauds
I pay almost no attention to new movies or tv shows these days that when I heard streamers talking about morbius I thought they were saying  morpheus  and they were referring to the new matrix movie that came out...   I haven t been to a movie theater in about 10 years and nothing s made me interested in going back.    d
title says worst marvel movie ever yup lol I think that how bad it was for me too lol. I wasted almost 2 hours of my life. excellent review  melonie mac go boom. the batman was awesome and saw it last night. worth it
wow  you did find the one redeeming point in this movie! that takes some real optimism! lol. I heard the movie had some real production and creative problems!
here s the problem with morbius... he s  at best  a second string character who is more properly suited to being in a team  not as the lead character  on a very specific story type.thatsaid  the character and the story they were going for would be better suited to television  the mceu-tv.  and I say that because some very interesting stories are possible through the character.now. what I hope marvel does in this new phase is introduce the concept from back in the day  essentially  justice league dark .  it wouldn t be that hard to do.ghost rider from agents of shieldmoon knightdr strangeblade  although marvel made a mistake by not going with michael jaI white punisher from daredevil  and punisher just have an ongoing show where all of them dont have to be around each other all the time doing the same thing together. rather  focus on a good story which carries through each appearance and interaction that gives reason for them to come together that also ties into the movies.oh.  and keep wolverine out of it.
the minI sharing segments at the end are always a treat  like it renews my mind or something xd
those who sacrifice freedom for safety deserve neither. thomas jefferson
I love underworld  wish they d make another one
dracula untold  is a great vampire movie. underworld series I never tire of as well
sounds like a movie thatshould have been a minI series. I agree that jared leto is a good actor so I imagine it lies on the director why there s no emotion. or real character progression.
I finally did it. I went to the theater and watched more bs.  according to your review  my hearing is just fine.
if you like vampire fiction  maybe you d like hunter  the parenting. its an animation series based on world of darkness. excellent blend of genuinely creepy and gut-busting humor.
the movie went from what could have been good but  then went off the rails. but  a couple things I need to correct melonie on as she is not a comics based person who knows all about the characters  1. morbius and his friend whose name was not milo in the comics were partners who were working on curing his disease which if you seen michael morbius in the comics he did not look like how jared leto did in the film.2. the woman you were talking about how they were trying to push the love thing with is martine and in the comics she was morbius s wife to be and she too became a vampire like him just it was shown in the movie towards the end.3. milo s real name in the comics is loxias crown aka hunger who betrayed morbius and worked for the evil organization known as hydra  he kidnapped michael and experimented on him  in the movie he began killing people once he became a vampire and was framing morbius  he attacked milo because milo supposedly killed martine and on top of that  there was no reasoning with him because he believed people deserved to die which is also ripped from the comics cause milo aka loxias crown was never a good person. he even killed a whole family once long before he ever became a vampirea small suggestion and I am not being insulting to you  my friend.  why dont you try one of those online comics services like comixology where you can read all the comics you want. that way if another comic movie is coming out  you can look up the comics for that certain one and get a better feel for all things and then  next time you want to see another comic movie you will be better prepared for it. like I said just a suggestion to you  my friend. overall  the movie was not great so much stuff left out and things changed and then  there is the post creditscenes. overall the final judgement for morbius is a 3 10.
went to a movie for the first time since stupid covid started and it was a choice between my friends all suggested morbius and something in the back of my head said no even though I knew nothing about the movie or the comic its based on so I talked everyone into the batman which I figured we still needed to see and all I can say is Im so glad I wonthat debate.
sounds like it may have been better had morbius taken the serum second instead of first in order to stop his friend  then become what he hated. then walks in spiderman.
where do you watch it
@ultimate vexation  youtube lol
yes I agree with you its my second fav batman movie behind dark knight ok let s call it a tie between the batman and dark knight rises
shame. I will still check it out though  cuz I was looking forward to it. bonus to this is  that with soooo many people saying its trash  my expectations will be so low that Imight enjoy it. like the new matrix and eternals films  people trashed those so much that by the time I saw them  I was like  not too bad.
anyone hear that leto stayed in character on set to go to the bathroom  he s stunning and brave lol.
yesterday syfy played all 4 underworld movies  it was good. I ll never complain about watching kate beckinsale prance around in tight outfits.
the comparison between morbius and tokyo ghoul would be a good thing with the exception of it depends on what morbias we are talking about because one of them didn t care it was just me living I dont care humans are cattle and other ones have had a vampire with a conscience restart
I honestly dont know how people cantake someone as talented as jared leto  and screw up whatever he s in.
it hurts worse for me because I like morbius as a character.
word up ms. mac. you had me at underworld  tokyo ghoul and cinnabon!
in a perfect world we would have gotten a morbius in the 80s directed by david cronenberg starting Christopher lee.
I have not watched it yet  but about milo immediately doing a 180 and becoming a monster. I have seen perfectly nice people turn into complete assholes overnight after obtaining even the slightest modicum of power. I can only imagine what kind of person they would become if they had enough power to truly believe themselves outside the reach of human laws. I am not saying that everyone is like this but there are definitely some who are and they could be the nicest people you will ever meet...until the gain power.
tldr  I think you watched a different movie than i.did you fall asleep during portions  milo was definitely portrayed as a baddie from the moment he split from morbius   the way he continued to assault that bully after he was down to the physical assaults on morbius when he was told he could have the serum  just sceams villain origin story. when he was alone in the lab after seeing morris s in the tank you knew then that he had taken a vial  you just weren t shown it. and as for morbius trying to help milo  he tries so many times to help milo that I was rooting for milo to kill him.  my patience with the pleading was already up before he went to jail  and I got 4 children to adulthood. when he realized what he had done to himself thats all he did was try to help milo.  over and over  it just became pathetic.  milo told him repeatedly that this is what he wanted and morris s should join him.  it was very clear early on the milo held regular people in contempt as they paraded around in their healthy bodies  and his jealousy was evident in smith s performance.  when he finally had the ability to get up and move around why would he try to  help  the very people who looked down on him his whole life I think   if you looked at the movie from the villain perspective you would naturally see it differently but also see the nuances in their performances that brings out the story.    as for the message  morbius  help your friends until their continued and deliberate actions will bring about their undoing. milo  absolute power corrupts absolutely. the only real puzzling aspect that I found in this movie were the end creditscenes. they were baffling in their absurdity  and had no place in this movie.
I thought it was alright. was kind of like a 90s comic book movie. everything wrong with it was with the editing. cause there was some good ingredients just mixed poorly
classic movies would build to a climax.  star wars  exorcist  alien  falling down  halloween  etcsounds like you wished morbius followed that formula
wait  movies are supposed to have actual character development and progression   I had no idea!!  haha.
I just caught up on the last 2 days of your videos. and now I get another  heck yeah!
I dont even need to watch the video to know the reason it was bad  jared leto
this sounded cool   so glad I waited for youtube reviews lol. I heard its a dumpster fire
the eternals makes morbius look like gone with the wind.
I absolutely love og underworld also. morbius though . idk might be one of those that needs to sit and stew for a bit
damn. I enjoyed it  thought it was cool. not going to be the most memorable compared to other marvel content  but I was entertained
you should watch interview with the vampire. I had to sneak into the theater to see that one.
but morbius is a good movie
@dan lance  - is it
exactly
the end credits scenes were to help set up sony s spider-man universe as well  as  set up a sinister six movie.
@dustythemaverick  oh I know it was to set up something. but the why and how are the questions.  why was he moved to morbius  reality instead of simply forgetting peter parker like the 7 trillion other people on that planet  when spider-man was mentioned morbius didn t react for the good or bad like had no opinion recollection of spider-man.if this place didn t have a chitarI invasion what is he using to power thatsuit       he wasn t the inventor in that movie  so who made thatsuit  remember he just provided the materials and mason built all the toys. he didn t even know what some of the stuff did.if there was an alien invasion to provide the materials for that getup  who stopped them from taking over the world      those scenes just didn t make sense. just like putting venom in no way home. what was the point of that
so did I  Im trying to figure out what went wrong. I really enjoyed myself watching it.
this sounds like an attempt to squeeze a long series into a couple hour movie. this seemingly needed to be a series  and this movie should have ended with some sort of victory  and sickly dude bro taking the  cure . there probably wasn t character development because there wasn t time for it.
I cantell you why   leto.not just every character he s ever played  but also him personally is like barney fife acting like a cross between charles manson and john lennon.
pray for my efforts in trying to get my best friend to not take me to that freaking movie on friday  please.
good to know that the younger generation knows who s the real king of monsters  Godzilla  lol.
I was gonna go see morbius  but I guess it wasn t worth the watch after all...also  the original underworld was fantastic!!!
if by some miracle they get this sinister six movie going  who does everyone think should be the spiderman they face
he should of shouted back   well maybe you should of kept other guys out of youre wife s mouth first !!  but then it would be on  so maybe its for the best that he hadn t
good video  everyone does have some sort of addiction.
sounds like they dont explain how  vampire  mutation removes the humanity and empathy.he fights this and try s to gain his humanity. but 100  at beginning doesnt care about killing
you dont want none of this ricky bobby. it will make you powerful and immortal and sexy and removes your moral inhibitions!
I get told the same thing about my diet as well. its just like data when youre trying to compile numbers.garbage in   garbage out
I dont think it was that bad honestly  Imean there were holes but it was better than venom 2 imo.
why morbius was so bad because it had jared leto in it.
great video  melonie...
morbius had a bad script  but its a movie thatshould be released in 2000 but I have to say for me it was ok not that bad but not that good  and the movie is now 2 years old because of the pandemic xdbtw morbius ist a sony movie
have you watched conan from 1960  its a pretty cool movie. it was about leftists controlling young people like a cult  and of course about conan being strong and tough  sticking to what s important in life.
hello melanie  the last days are stated to be after the rebuilding of the temple in jerusalem. there is a date given for when that will happen and thats 2 300 years after the destruction of the second temple. 70 c.e.  that generation thatsees the temple rebuilt will not pass away  until this age is complete. so yes  we re very close. thats 400-500 years from now.
I trust your review  I dont trust the critics anymore.  not after they loved thatshow on netflix about  the zexualizing young girls
I thought the movie was very entertaining. I have a rich background in marvel comics and perhaps Im a bit bias  but I enjoyed it. I dont think anybody was expecting this movie to be the best movie they ve ever seen  but I think people are definitely being too harsh on it.
is it 100 bad   or bad but with some good moment like venom

why would you use the word leftist to describe james earl jones s character
conan from 1960
that movie was from 1982.
1960
@mr. joe dirt  I was thinking of another one that was older  but no matter
@sl ine mccool  that I wrote the year wrong in haste bothers you  how amusing.
@grasslander  there was no conan movie before that one.
I completely agree! when I went to watch it  I was legit trying to look for the stuff that people were criticizing it for. but I couldn t find it. I actually enjoyed myself.
they really are. her take doesnt make much sense. as everything she says is clearly not even in the movie
@dan lance  yep! like the big thing with the nurse  that is not what happened in the movie.
life long spider-man fan here. glad you all enjoyed  but I was bored stiff. it was predictable and boring through-out. I didn t feel there was any redeeming factors in the movie at all. in my opinion  if this didn t have the marvel logo  it would be looked upon even worse.
I agree with almost everything you say. its better than the batman movie though.
its a character that nobody really knows nor cares about in the spider man universe. there s a reason as to why individuals have no desire to see itsuch as myself. lol
is it pretty sad that jared leto just couldn t catch a break on either marvel nor dc
I was interested in morbius originally because I like the character  well  I like the 90s spiderman depiction at least . I keep hearing bad things and these companies keep using the money they make off of  good  movies to make woke garbage so Im happy to not spend any money on it. thanks for saving me some cash!
a quote from house of card s  you are entitled to nothing
hImelonie  love your channel.so glad to hear that you dont believe in astrology. us geminis dont believe in it either
sigh I was looking forward too this one .  well not surprised these days.
this is why you need a man to take you to the theater. if the movie s bad you can blame him  then use him for your guilty pleasure.
was morbius a sony movie  that would make sense.
23 30 I see nothing wrong with being addicted to korn. its good music.
ate my dinner while listening to your sermon! you should do more of that melonie  that whole segment was excellent. you were on point and I loved the message of self-control. I often make the same point when discussing the current state of american society. its especially important for young people that have been raised on the leftist agenda which teaches the exact opposite of self-control. life isn t about the pursuit of pleasure.
there s not much subtlety in society today.  as a guy  its always nice to have a friend who will smack you in the back of the head - when appropriate.
I thought it was alright. gave it a 3 out of 5.
hey melonie I just want to say that I like vampire movies and I like how it is so dark and bloody and so I also like jared leto as he was playing joker in batman movies but he was not that good actor to play vampire character in morbius movie  ok melonie. anyway I just want to tell you that and tell you that I am sorry that you didn t like the movie and hope you like some other movies in future  ok melonie. anyway I hope you have had a great day today at gym and at home with your pets and I hope you continuing to have a wonderful   great blessed evening at home with your pets and have a good night too  ok melonie.
itsounds like you think they should ve added about 15 minutes or so to the movie. now you see how zach snyder films get to four hours and the batman was 3. I wouldn t be surprised if a directors cut exists thatsolves the issues you raisedalso  the eternals was far worse
I thought it was a good movie regardless there were a few things I didn t like especially with the ending but overall I enjoyed it. I grew up reading all the marvel comics as a child   it brings me such joy to see these movies being made
I had to wait on this video to comment because I had to plans to watch  even though I didn t think it would be good.
day 25 of commenting on your videos until g-fuel sponsors me.Ive lost all faith in anything out of disney tbh. shame  they re killing everything I loved  including themselves. when are all of us like minded non wokies going to start banding together and releasing dope content
the first act of the morbius movie was good but it fail off after that
as a millenial gen x mix I strongly resent being called a boomer in every video x
please dont go by reviews here. Im glad I didn t  because I actually went and enjoyed myself. Im not sure why  but people are being damn harsh with this movie for no reason. its a solid movie.
@six is hungry  no.
her review is really bad. as she focuses on points of the movie isn t true
this is like them ignoring dracula untold which was awesome  and forcing the mummy with tom cruise down our throats which was total garbage.
dc fans  and his name is jared leto
I stick with ghost ryder all day
seriousely you almost want to walk out of the cinema. lots of peeps in netherlands is now trash talkin about morbius
honestly  promiscuity is a normal part of peoples  development. seeing it as empowering isn t a healthy outlook  that I agree with  but its perfectly normal for people to go through a phase of that while they re young. ideally  you d learn how to deal with and control your urges with help from your parents and peers. then  you d be perfectly fine and well-adjusted. the problem nowadays is the increasing lack of thatsupport structure  combined with  the cool kids are doing it . I think at the core  be it carrousel-culture  drugs or lootboxes  the problem is an increasing lack of teaching people self-control. its a vital life skill and kids aren t learning it anymore.
God I love corn
was blade in there
hey melonie what s your oppions on the max payne series  and  sleeping dogs
melonie  review the batman!
this is upsetting. I really enjoyed jared leto as joker and thought he would have more say and respect in ensuring they portrayed morbius correct. but the reviews have been so one sided it is clear this movie is a massive letdown. good thing my theater isn t open so I wont be talked into wasting my money.
actually because of a process called axial precession about half of people think they are the wrong sign because the astrological calendar is now off by about 15 days.
itshould ve been pg18 or something
melonie mac  mobius is badme  really me   proceeds to watch videome  thats it   enough of people ruining the things I love  ama watch anime and read manga and watch youtube   for the rest of the year
hold on !!! love ya and all  but damn! why are you going after my cinnabon
spicytake eragon is better than lotr and morbius was a good movie. btw morbius didn t kill her  milo did. he was quiet because clearly youremain silent for common sense legal purposes and he wasn t sure what happened and was in shock. I do agree milo should have been shown more humanity loss but again thats common sense to know of the grudge. you need more story telling to be happy. deathnote had how many hours to build a character  based on what you are saying you probably would need a  netflix series  of this movie to appreciate it. but thanks for sharing your opinion!
she definitely got some facts about the movie wrong. mobius never killed anybody he was working with that was milo. and when mobius did think it was him he was distraught about it. also I dont think milo needed any ramp-up moment to be evil he just needed a better justification. alternatively it could have been a situation in which milo was okay with killing people to get blood because he would rather do that than get sick and die. he lived his entire life being sick and possibly dying it wouldn t be out of the realm of possibility that his fear of going back to that outweighed his morals.
the grudge at 1 24
here s why  they optioned the movie to new line when blade 2 was out to new line. so this movie has been kicked around and in development hell for 20 years. the rights issues with comic books have been bad. marvel would sell off portions of their franchises. like for instance  you used to not be able to make an avengers movie with scarlet witch because fox owned the x-men franchise  which includes wanda and pietro. plus  a pg-13 vampire movie with no blood  no.gigan is still better.
I bet most people still dont understand that this is not mcu. people are buying tickets around me left and right...
the only  best vampire lure for me is the universe of vampire the masquerade. while blade universe is somwhat interesting also and twilight universe is the easily the worst.
sleeping dogs  street-fu is pretty cool.
if I went with the reviews  I wouldn t have went to see it. but I watched it and enjoyed this  so Im just so confused as to why people hate itso much. I honestly dont.
though we may not agree on the eragon lotr take lol  I completely agree with your take on morbius. and youre right  milo killed that nurse not morbius lol. that was one of the biggest twists of the movie xd. I was so confused when she mentioned it lol
that nurse  he said he worked with her for a long time
I could tell by the trailer that morbius was going to be awful. I dont think hollywood is capable of making a good movie anymore. its just a lost cause. its either endless sequels or remakes that get worse and worse  scolding and lecturing woke propaganda  or just all visual effects and no story.
watch mask of the phantasm. it will be your favorite batman movie.
I watched morbius back on thursday and I gave it a 10 10.
you like some evil stuff eh melonie no bueno
I love you of course. but nothing can be worse than eternals. its impossible. you could have leto pooping on a toilet for a whole movie and it would be better.same goes for captain marvel.
the elder stuff  what you were taught is incomplete. yes  respect the elders  but also value the youngsters  thats balanced. youngster doesnt respect elder  dont expect the elder to value the youngster.elder doesnt value youngster  dont expect the youngster to respect the elder.
the 1st 40 secs when she starts laughing when she talked about mobius I knew they may have butchered it.theres bad...God awful....and I dont even want to talk about it.but for the sake of this video...she must
even if your biological parents are terrible and dont deserve your respect  there will still be other adults and elders who try to look out for you and help you get footing in life. I dont believe the Bible means respect and be obedient to biological parents specifically  I believe it refers to whatever adult s  fill the role regardless of who they are - teachers  neighbors  grandparents  a friend s parents  bosses  the guy who sits in front of you at church  the woman you meet in the checkout line  however God brings them into your life.your parents are the ones who raise you  tell you the hard truths  teach you what it means to be a man or woman  and or look out for and watch over you  not necessarily the ones who bring you into the world. your brothers and sisters are the friends you can confide in and will be there and have your back even if they aren t in a good position either  not necessarily the ones you grew up with.if youreject and disrespect that family  you are rejecting your own interests and harming yourself and might drive away all the people who care about you. even if they are wrong or not helpful  the normal reaction is to appreciate that they care.
moon knight movie!!!
30 seconds in and Im already disappointed. I was actually really looking forward to morbius. thats a shame.
the movie was awful from start to finish. there were so many things that didn t make sense. he was way overpowered too. he was smashing through steel like the hulk. he was moving so fast that bullets were in slow motion to him. he looked like the flash. the way he was running and jumping across the city made spiderman looked like an invalid. his hearing was kryptonian level. then there was the stupid things in the story that happened. he was making advanced dna lab equipment out of an old printer used to make counterfeit money. he did that in a condemned building right in the middle of the city on a busy street and nobody noticed. within 20 minutes everyone knew that milo was gonna get the serum and turn evil so they could have a big climactic battle. they were tanking falls from the top of skyscraper through the pavement that would have killed spiderman. the movie is just another cash grab made by people that never read the comics.
im going to recommend u to a great vampire movie check out fright night the og version and lost boys
I dont understand how anybody could praise the batman  I personally found it to be one of the worst batman movies ever made... but thats the beauty of opinions. keep up the great work!
they should of just copied his story from the 90s spider-man cartoon
liberty is our birthright from God to us as americans. we should not be like that profane person  esau  who sold his birthright for some stew. he did not decern spiritual things.
this cant work as a blockbuster pg-13 4 quadrant movie.
morbius should have been played by a better actor!!
hey melonie! have you checked your email recently  I sent you a gift to celebrate 30k subs! hope you like.
15 22shhh  dont give them journos any ideas.
let s be honest morbius was bad but at leas but it wasn t ms.marvel bad. true story due to the xI flu our local spencer s close out and during its closing days they were lowering the prices and in the last few days ms marvel dvds were costing 3 bucks on her display and nobody bought em.
Im glad I collected so many old movies over the years.
same. I not saying she s doing this  but I feel a lot of people are being too harsh with this and are possibly jumping on the hate bandwagon.
@six is hungry  come on  its just a movie...
its a pretty solid movie  please dont go by the reviews here. see for yourself. I went with my husband and two siblings and we all liked it. and my husband is more critical than me  he wasn t even a big fan of the batman lol
@six is hungry  to each their own. honestly  I ll have to reference the morbius from the comics to get my own honest take on it. just seems like from melonie s review  this morbius  character development was poorly written. personally  when I get a whiff of the main character s character not being lazily written  I automatically lose my appetite for the movie. there s way too many great movies and video games with great stories and great characters nowadays to excuse that. I ll still give the movie a shot and do my own research on the comics  but Im getting really tired of lazy writing and cookie cutter movies. I will say though  they did a decent job with the venom movies.
@six is hungry  also  love the profile pic and name lol. great game  that.
disney didn t even produce this  sony did. and by your definition  how should he have been as a vampire  Im truly curious.
@six is hungry the movie was produced by columbia pictures in association with marvel and distributed by sony pictures releasing. marvel is wholly owned by disney so disney was associated with this movie. unlike you  I am an actual real comic book fan. I started reading comics in 1982.  morbius is what is called a pseudo vampire. he is not a true vampire. his strength and speed shouldn t have been anywhere near what they had it in the movie. morbius at his peak can lift about 1500 pounds. in the movie he was bashing through steel like luke cage or the thing. his speed is nowhere near what they had in the movie either. morbius was moving so fast that he was effortlessly dodging bullets fired a few feet away. his buddy milo took out people before they could even blink. then there is the super hearing. he was able to single out people from miles away in the middle of a big noisy city like he was superman or something. he was way overpowered. in the comic his physical strength  speed  and agility was about double that of captain america who was the peak of human capabilities and could press 800 pounds overhead. he could also glide on air currents in the comic. I saw him do something similar once in the movie. I ll try to answer your question the best I can. morbius was not a popular main character. he was more a tragic side villain. his condition made him into a monster. at times he would be cured and be a normal decent guy. he was never really popular enough to have his own movie. he s a had miniseries or two and been featured in storylines from time to time  but nothing major. I would have had him be a side character in a spiderman movie the way he was meant to be. I wouldn t have had him busting through steel doors or moving as fast as quicksilver like they did in the movie either. he was a dangerous combatant due to his ferocity  claws  and fangs more than his strength and speed. Im a comic book purist and think the movies should be just like the comics of the 80 s and 90 s.
@mr. joe dirt  honestly I appreciate your response and now I understand  thanks for that. I learned something new. my apologies if any part of my comment was harsh.
@six is hungry  you have nothing to apologize for. Im just an old comic book nerd thats almost 50 and can be a bit grouchy.
@mr. joe dirt  I was born in the year woodstock and I totally agree with you  I still got all my old comic books.
I agree it needs an r rating.
I haven t seen it  could you try sending again  thank you so much!
@melonie mac go boom  sent it again    hopefully it gets through this time. enjoy!
dc fans  first time
its marver char but sonys movie
nice.
22 seconds
maval owns blade also sooooooo
also  sony marvel movie. not marvel. sony runs wild with this stuff. case in point- ghost rider and venom.
no mention of tomb raider or ms. croft  who are you and what have you done with melonie
question how can morbius be worst then thor  the dark world
I saw it on saturday only because of jared leto  I thought he was damn hot  but I wasn t a fan of the movie itself. to me it was mostly boring to be honest.
I have hole underworld movie series dvd s
I knew this movie was going to be shit when I saw the trailer over a year ago and then it went silent for a long time.
commenting to feed the algorithm
corn addiction  more like corny addiction am I right
oh yeah  boom!!!!
yeah  Im gonna wait for home video. just...looks kinda...ehhhh. and after spider-man no way home too!
hey boom boom what s up!
im assuming the writers are morally bankrupt. or they just suck at writing
comment for the algorithm  where is the cat
did u hear elon musk bought twitter
my condolences to you for watching that pile of horse turd.
Im a dc fangirl  morbius is worse than anything dc has ever made imo

more like how can it be worse than black widow or eternals wich it wasnt
@jens andersson of the tau ri  agreed  I liked dark world and morbius and both are miles better than the worst movies in marvel. worst marvel movie is way too harsh a critique here.
I saw a half hour of morbius and I stopped watching it
jared leto just cannot act...
its funny the woke are trying to make the villains liked by making movie based on villains  we like super hero s  villains are in the movie to get their asses kicked.
I never cared about the character morbius to even be excited about seeing this movie and I cared even less about jaredleto  long story short regardless of reviews I was never going to see this movie.
I feel like people calling this the worst marvel movie never watched dare devil or elektra lol
you seem confused....
this will probably will get me alot of hate  but so be it. the world of hollyweird  and game industry are so trying their hardest to push all straight white men bad. especially us old straight white men. you can see it in games  you can see it in tv shows movies  ect... now for what I see so many commercials today. mixed races  along with  I hate the term gay. gay has been corrupted like so many other words. so many more gays in commercials. when I see shows usually if guy is white he is the buffoon. if he is Christian white he is portrayed as the crazy buffoon guy. just proves that the world hates God to their core. so melonie keep sharing God s word and his son  Jesus Christ our savior. never give up the good fight. we win in the end! God is my Lord  but you are my hero!
worse than captain marvel   damn .
I fell aslepp 3 times watching it... suuuuuuuper boring.
underworld was bad. its like twilight bad but more action
I ll go see it. why  well  everyone loves  the batman ... I hated it. ben shapiro is the only person Ive come across  who shares the same view  as me  on  the batman .
well the trailer looked bad so no surprises here.
I had an addiction to corn. it is an addiction so hard to give over yo Jesus. but with all sins  Jesus Christ can cure you. if we repent God throws our repented sins as far as the east is from the west. there are so many people who have an addiction to corn. this is a sin many pastors have. if not  when was the last time you heard a sermon on corn addiction  or I will throw in gluttony.

I disagree. I found morbius to be a decent movie  certainly better than the eternals.
more bs am I right
iron man 3 was worse no
if your zodiac sign  is cancer in the comment section like this comment  Im also a cancer  my moon is black moon lilith
extremely disappointing.  I was looking forward to this movie  but Im coming to expect nothing but trash and woke nonsense from disney these days.
they dont understand the villains are a foil to the heroes in stories. yeah the best villains are questionably relatable but they should never be viewed as the protagonist of the story. an enemy to be respected and feared but not a role model.
lol right !
uhmm this movie is not worse than that  thats just ridiculous.
Im here to stay.   and I like that about you.
I could easily burn some sense and calories with your help.
agreed  same here. it was solid and I enjoyed myself. Ive definitely seen worse marvel movies.
sony produced this  not disney lol. and the movie is solid  Im really suggesting to see this movie for yourself. it was entertaining. not sure why people are being so harsh with this movie. definitely way more than it deserves. I was literally looking for the reasons people didn t like it  and by the end of the movie I was confused by these reviews because I liked it.
worst marvel movie ever  can it really be worse than thor dark world  haven t seen it yet but the more I hear about it the less I want to
the new batman was woke garbage.
it was sony not marvel. sony owns the rights to spider man and his villains
worst marvel movie was definitely eternals. so much melodrama. ugh.
not to say jared leto is a bad actor.   oh  he is.  name a single role he played that was memorable for good reasons.
please watch it for yourself  I would ve missed out if I went by these reviews  its a solid movies. plus there is a big detail  its not subtle at all  in the film thatshe got wrong. you ll know what Im talking about when you go see it.
it had some lame woke lines in it  but ultimately I thought it was a great movie
@melonie mac go boom  I couldn t watch past black commissioner gordon. these people need to learn to make their own original characters and stop poc washing everyone. I normally wouldn t care that much but they do itso much its beginning to irk me. and they turned batman into a kpop idol thatsparkles. he s supposed to be bigger and manlier. patty-son over here cant even pull off the batman voice
