I really hope the games go back to being fun. I just wanna see lara have fun again! also we need the iconic dual guns and braid back  man I just hope we get something at this point
I hope you can feel encouraged by what you do. I only just found this channel and I feel like its very uplifting and its great to see you talk about these things and incorporate a biblical perspective which is not easy these days! good on you  and great video!
lara croft was an alpha female  and the new lara croft doesnt have the same vibe.  the og lara was bold  strong  and not afraid to be sexy.  she carried herself with dignity  shame-free and strong.  it wasn t so much her appearance that made her such a luscious figure  it was her attitude and aptitude  her confidence and stride.  that alpha female energy is what made her into a legend  not her gender.
dont forget that youre not alone in this.  plenty of people who want to support your videos. and let s not forget your amazing appearance on fnt. lots of people like them and you fighting this fight and we all appreciate all of you.
Im totally with you on the subject of drinking  Ive been pressured a lot to drink and Ive been shamed for refusing to drink and its just sad how so many destructive behaviours are so normalized and even encouraged. we should never let ourselves be pressured into giving up our own values and principles and engaging in destructive behaviour just because its what everyone else is doing. stay true to yourselves and to what makes you better people  and if someone doesnt respect that they re not worth keeping around.
how you describe the cutscenes to be like  treats  is perfect! thats what feels right in games  I do not think games should be used for story telling as the main focus  games are about winning lol there s gotta be accomplishment and rewards not only story progression. cinematic game is a trigger phrase for me now lol I  hope that they dont go too dramatic and emotional for the new tr game  fingers crossed  but I wont be surprised if the do
I should be excited for this but we all know that we aren t going to get the lara we want or deserve.
I completely agree. the thing that the devs failed to see in lara is thatshe is unattainable but thats what makes her so incredible! we dont want her to be more like us  we want to be more like her. making her weak and vulnerable and  human  just watered down her character and essence. what I would be seriously impressed by is if they let go of the  ok we hear you  but we re going to raise you a combination of all three  and its like... no... just admit that the reboot lara is dead and gone  and we need a new revisit of the lara we know and love.
I really wish they would consult you on all things laura croft before doing anything for the character. we should start a petition for you being a creative director or something
I have high hopes for the next game tbh. I dont think it ll ever be exactly what it was  and not everyone will be completely happy but since crystal is at least seeing that they need to unify the timelines  it means they re seeing and understanding more of what fans actually want. the netflix show may not be exactly what everyone wants  but at the end of the day its just extra promo. the actual meat is in the video game  and shadow was a step in a pretty good direction in a lot of ways!
melonie describing in detail what lara croft s physique should be is a real mood.
great video. I had the original game many years ago when it first came out. I love your view points on  how lara croft s character should be. keep doing what you are doing its good to see someone with common sense and good character staying true to yourself.  gives me hope for humanity
was hoping for more from the announcement honestly since its been such a while since the last game  but I guess it was just a obligated unreal engine 5 announcement that devs have had to make recently. still fun to hear melonie talk about it though!
regarding the statue...  what I gather about lara is thatshe  as you have stated  is motivated by what she can achieve  and would not be so motivated to have a statue erected in her likeness.I believe the statue is a misstep...  a mistake  especially if what they are trying to do is create an experience as if she  lara  is an actual person.rather what they should have done  was create a museum that would exhibit   artifacts from her adventures  some of her equipment  taxidermy trophies of her conquests   I only play for sport    with snippets of lore and photographs  to flesh out the context for each exhibit and treat it with the seriousness of an actual museum.you know...  keep it classy. they can sell the tacky stuff at the gift shop. q  love you work.go get  em  tiger!
as I understand it the  new  lara croft they made some years ago  the one where you start on a beach and can hunt etc  was supposed to be more of an origin story  same for the movie  and she would progress to become the lara croft we know in later games and movie that is based of that game .
I felt  lara was one of those spaghettI western type of characters  lone wolf samuraI  that during their travels would stumble across a new village where all the other characters knew through her body language that this is a unique  experienced  confident adventurer  one not to be mess with    if was mess with  said challenger was embarrassed. during the passing through  the adventurer would help new village and gain something  experience  material of value  and then be offered a normal life in said village. the character would expressed the idea in their eyes body language  but turn around   look into the unknown  then crack a slight smile. the adventurer enjoys the unknown  the thrill  while riding off into the sunset. no explanation to their motivations  their pain  their past  none of it  which keeps them mysterious! I like the old lara  no need to hear her back story  she s here and now  kicking ass with no regrets!
finally had a chance to check out the video and new channel. came for tr thoughts  and came away with so much more.Ive slowly begun to learn thatsocial media encourages isolation maliciously keeping us glued to our devices  and since we are inherently social creatures  this has had such a negative effect on my overall mental health. Ive been without family for a long time as they live 15 hours away  and in my quest to meet new friends online  Ive succeeded only in hurting those closest to me. it has clouded my judgement  and stifled my attempts to grow as a person. I dont envy anyone that has to use social media for their career. disconnect as often as you need and absolutely spend more time with your brothers and other family whenever you are able. take care of yourself.
love crystal dynamics! hopefully they do a good job!
I agree with you to an extent. they did change a lot of lara s  background story and personality  which I loved sooo much. I honestly dont mind the legend series. underworld is one of my favorites  but obviously the classics are much better overall since the puzzles were more difficult and lara was so sassy. I am not a huge fan of the reboot. I still haven t played shadow since I bought it in 2018  lol. I realize that I haven t because of the fact thatshe is nothing like the classic lara that I knew and loved as a wee girl. I am a huge graphics whore and hate playing old games  so even this new and improved graphics didn t entice me enough to finish the latest series. I am working my way up to it though. I am binge playing the tomb raider series currently.
thanks for reading my last comment melonie mac  I thought it might be too long but you are awesome! there are truthfully hardly any gaming channels that are even in my youtube feed anymore because I dont like the channels that have a lot of staff and a bunch of writers making their content. I really dont care to watch a video about ea s next fifa or the next cookie cutter ubisoft game because the channel got some money from one of those huge companies. itseems fake to me. you are an honest delight melonie because you keep it real with you own distinct personality  you upload insightful and entertaining videos daily  and you have a great connection with your subscribers reading out comments and also going on livestreams like with chrissie mayr. keep doing what you are doing  you are fantastic at covering video game news and culture. if people wanna criticize you for stupid stuff its because you do not fit into the pre-conceived stereotypes they have in their minds of what you should be. personally I play mostly fps games and dont really like third person games  but I still watch you talk about tomb raider because a lot of your thoughts on the state of the industry are true across every genre. be happy you are not a battlefield fan right now. it is silly and immature for people to criticize you when you are speaking from the heart and are also right. God bless you and stay awesome!
@komanga  it was different  especially because it was an unusual choice to make a female lead back then.  they existed  but other than samus  not a whole lot had broken out like lara did.  the inherent coolness of being a breakout star is a big deal  so made even more so because she was a woman   sure  totally  it was the time and place for it to happen and she was the shooting star that made it happen.
well I think they wanted to show the more vulnerable side of her which is why they made her different
@bearded frog  not even samus broke out the way lara croft did. tomb raider with its sales showed female lead games could work and she just became an instant icon. Imean tomb raider has held the record for the best selling video game series with a female lead since the late 90 s  currently at 88 million units  while metroid sadly just recently hit the 20 million mark.
@ladylaracroft96  I think a lot of it also has to do with demographics.  metroid is nintendo exclusive  whereas tomb raider was pc first  then had console ports.  tomb raider had a much better ad campaign  thats for sure - lara was everywhere  I even still have the mad magazine with tomb raider parodies as the main article.  I fell out of mad mid-2000s  when they started getting hyper-political and also after prohias  spy vs spy was my main draw to mad  died  but I cant recall anytime metroid showed up in any of them.  nintendo didn t market metroid or samus right and never reached the mainstream demographic like they did with lara  and they most certainly didn t give her a magnetic personality like lara had  either.
the new lara is a modern feminist ideal in many ways in my opinion. many women I know despise her and from a franchise that as I was growing up was almost entirely women that played it  thats bad.
yeah she seems sweet and submissive even vulnerable  in a way
I did lime the newer sweeter version
alcohol is the real killer. I think its around 100 000 deaths per year due to alcohol  in the us . and as someone who has recovered from alcoholism  let me tell you it isn t worth it. you lose friends  family  dignity  money  health  time  your dreams.. you risk jail time  hurting the ones you love  and making yourself do things you never thought you were capable of. the funny thing about alcohol is you didn t know you needed it until you started drinking it.
these days you can get a lot of non-alcoholic beers and mocktails if you want to look like youre drinking. just dont get into rounds. I know a few people who dont drink because they are trying to stay fit and everyone is ok with that. heck  even if you dont have a reason  most adults are ok with someone not drinking. and Im irish. only immature or insecure people would try to pressure someone into drinking. as you say  walk away from them.
@donkeysunited  Im not the only irish non-drinker!! booze is nothing but trouble long term and when you take your money and buy booze  you can literally see it going down the toilet on your next trip to the bathroom!
games can be both. no one is forcing you to play narrative driven games.
@adanu191  and then there are games that manage to tell a story with the gameplay  as the late great totalbiscuit used to say  just look at brothers - a tale of two sons.
@adanu191  seriously these people are unreal
@3dmaster  yeah. one of my favorite games is detriot become human. by emily s standards its not a game at all.
I second this
lara
I third this suggestion.
executive consultant.pays better.
where do I sign
exactly
the expliciated stated its a reboot many times. this is a completely new timeline and new lara  not connected to the legend timeline or classic timeline. their is plenty of videos out there that explain the three different timelines of tomb raider
thank you for talking about the peer pressure to do things we dont do. I do not drink at all and only ever had once when I was 18 and never again. people used to ask me but once all my friends realized that I was always stone cold sober  they knew they could trust me to drive their cars. and with my medical condition  I take my health seriously and no alcohol no tobacco has always been me.  live a little  thats restrictive  go sleep around  are things we wouldn t say to our friends if we care about them. to me  itseems like they are the ones with the issue. I love life and appreciate every day Ive been given. Ive got great support and a roof over my head. I dont need  stuff  when I get far more joy by being out in nature and exploring the world around me. and yes  we need old lara for this game that will be out in a few years! I wont hold my breath though.
eh  I like the shooting  I like the open level design and actually discovering things. I like realistic enemies too. her design needs work  and back story. the whole tomb could have been interwoven better too.
my  1 tr news source. its great that news has been dropped. Im ok if they ve only just started working on it and am happy to wait.I definitely want the game to be alot more challenging and more identifiable with og lara.
lara croft is probably not alone in the department of becoming watered down in terms of her personality and motives for being who she is  samus aran in metroid  other m descended from being the independent  super-powerful metroid-busting bounty hunter who did things her own way  to someone who needed permission to activate the varia feature on her power suit even when the environment was  as hot af . . .
I am curious what would you have done if u were in charge of the franchise. like how would you continue classic lara and build her back up story wise after the poor reception and criticism of aod
I wish you were on the game development team mel!  you know  lara 100
hey  I hope the new tomb raider is one you ll enjoy. I never played much tomb raider myself  but my friend had a ps and had those games growing up  so Im plenty familiar with lara. I ll have to check the classic games out myself one day  though.
I think that at the least  they should be looking to you for good ideas for the tomb raider games. you look like you d make a good lara as far as that goes. I dont know why they want to make her short  have they not seen female athletes  volleyball players  basketball  etc keep doing your thing. youre inspiring people and sharing the word. what could be better
I am always ready to listen to melonie rant about video games for half an hour. lmao
we really need u on the crystal team   because not only are u a major fan of the series   but youre also very non biased and your ideas are perfect. been watching your videos for years and u were the first youtuber I ever watched when I first started getting into tomb raider. my first tr game was when legend came out and then I went back and played all of the classics  which I adore more than anything  thank u for being u n getting me into video games   n jus changing my life forever.
as a tom raider player from the beginning  I think the last game went a long way towards having a lot of tough tombs  and traversal elements  if you have all the help stuff turned off.  or it could be that Im old now  and its just going to be harder than it otherwise would be  I dont know!  I really dont like the incredibly boring hub areas  though  where you wander around villages getting lame fetch-quests  etc.  but I feel its the very best effort  tomb exploration-wise  that crystal has done.
I also hope crystal listens to influencers like you  great job on the tombs in the last game - Ive played the legend anniversary underworld games  watched angelina jolie in the tomb raider movies and thats how lara is fixed in my mind.  the classic tr games sound like fun  hopefully they ll be part of sony s library in the new game pass  they sound a bit like the  I apologize for the reference!  dark souls of adventure gaming.hopefully crystal will bring back the beautiful and sassy lara croft  that game would be much more fun to play than homogenous  meh  lara.
that netflix series reminds me of a show that fox once had called the last man on earth. the commercials led you to believe that you d have just one guy explore an empty world on his own and go through comedic antics without anyone else around to support him. that lasted for half an episode until the second character was introduced. I bet thats how the producers felt like having just one main character would make the show feel too empty.
they really do have all the elements at their disposal to make one of the best lara croft games out there. first you have the camera from underworld. bring back those cut-scenes so she can monologue about the site   civilization. and incorporate the camera into the gameplay so you can find stuff to upload to jonah in a basecamp  who then uploads it to lara s site. make building her fanbase and reputation a part of the goal... then there s jonah himelf. let him be her quartermaster! insertion  extraction  upgrading gear like the camera  have him be the guy in the chair when it comes to providing information in regards to human enemies.then there s the traversal   gunplay from the survivor games. the puzzles from the legends games. there really is so much there for an awesome   unified  tomb raider experience.but watch as they only  unify  lara by taking all of the wrong elements...
crystal have shown that they have nothing but contempt for classic lara so even if they do try to  revive it the game would probably reflect that contempt. nah  my focus and hype is where it belongs  on the incredible upcoming fan projects. freakraiders aod remake  tr kingdom  nicobass  tr2 remake to name only a few.games made by true fans  for fans with nothing but love for tomb raider driving their work.
Im not very familiar with the tomb raider franchise  but even I noticed a certain approach to lara s character  especially considering the movie side of things  and I think the emphasis on cinematic was done on purpose.point being  after heavy rain set the precedent  a lot of games go to that venue of giving a  cinematographic experience . whether this is a bunch of aspiring and or frustrated directors trying to cope with games  or the higher-ups pitching movie ideas in hope of the next mcu  I agree with ya  melonie. if I wanted a movie experience  I would be watching one  not playing a game!
8 20 they need companion characters for more dialogue for the voice actors. it would be really weird for a modern aaa game to not have a cast or much voice acting
you wishing for tall  strong  athletic  intimidating lara is like me wishing for tall  strong  athletic  intimidating samus. at least sakuraI kind of gave us this.
wow melonie  Ive always enjoyed your opinions and thoughts on tr franchise. specially as Ive always considered myself to be a tr number 1 fan since the 90s  so I get what you are saying. I feel the exact same way as you about the franchise. but wow. this video s being a lot more than just the same views and beliefs about tr but its about everything. stay strong cuz it was never meant to be eazy. but you are doing the right thing.
melonie has a fun and adorable personality! how could anyone not like her !
no none of this  this is awful  wtf. I hope this is sarcasm.
is nicobass still working on tr2  thought he quit because crystal and square where being difficult
@plumb raider   I hope tr2 does come out. I am looking forward to it.
@buster gundo  yeah me too  its the one thatstarted it all for me. started playing it for the first time when I was 8. finished it for the first time when I was 22 hahalot s of fond memories
where s the contempt in the legend trilogy
I want to go on a solitary journey with atmospheric ambient sounds spending hours scoping out an opening on a ledge and deciding if I can make the leap and praying that there is a secret hidden in there. dont want friends in the game  nor any daddy issues  nor any reflective angst. I want a grand  challenging adventure. challenging! no hand holding! dont think Im going to get it. well  there s always the first 3 games.
I have a feeling the next tomb raider  lara will look like thatswimmer who defeated every other women in the pool.
my wife and I played through the reboots. my only other experience with lara was with the very first game. we enjoyed the reboots because she isn t as much of a gamer as me and this was a happy medium as we would take turns.
we seem to share the same opinion on almost everything about the so called unified lara. to me what weta did could be a nice early teaser of a potential unified lara and this to me would really be a modern presentation of lara croft. the teaser artwork and weta look the best and this is what I am hoping for. besides after all the successful resident evil and ff remakes I think it is time tomb raider stepped in some way into this platform  and this would be the best time to do it.
tbh I loved all the tomb raider games the old ones the new ones all great I remember the tr 2  where you could explore her back garden with the optical course and that maze with the button that opened up the door in her house super excited to see where they take this one tho
the only way you can unify the timelines is to pull a no way home and have the 3 laras work together to overcome whatever is trying to merge their respective universes
you have such wonderful content. I watch every night while Im cooking dinner. but the thing I love most is you got me interested in reading my Bible. or getting into it more. Ive been starting plans on me Bible app and reading listening every night before bed. when I heard you say a prayer to somebody in one of your recent videos I was so awestruck because that does not happen by many influencers or youtubers at all. I gained so much more respect for you after that. I love that you are not afraid to share your faith with the world. it also makes me feel better and  like I said  start reading my Bible. thank you for being real and awesome.
youre literally the target audience so they should listen to people like you when it comes to tomb raider games! I think it would be a bold move to go back to the tank controls and make a more legacy type tomb raider game.
I like legends lara  mainly underworld. classic lara is cool to. we need an angel of darkness series remake.
I found your channel thanks to tomb raider    just beated shadows of tr which I didn t found that great at all. really glad to discover your channel  I really appreciate people that aren t afraid to express themselves without fear of what other people think. keep it up and dont let anyone or anything stop you. about that new tr announcement  if the game continue with more political correct or realistic bs I will move on as much I like lara s adventures.
I hope the franchise goes back to being stylish  mysterious  and fun. tired of the gritty and serious.
I like the new crystal dynamics games  im all for this!
once I heard the announcement I was anticipating your response. as a gears of war fan with this unreal engine announcement my thoughts very similar.
I dont know if I trust crystal dynamics to make good a tomb raider after the last 3. I wanna see someone else s take on it now.
share your opinion melonie!!!!! sometimes people might get mad right off the bat. but people need to hear all sides. if they live only hearing what they want to hear they wont grow. the best content is the authentic type. so keep being you. I know life comes with up s and downs. I pray this down feeling is short for you!
I feel like alex zedra would be perfect to mocap lara  but only if the new game makes her a badass again like in the og trilogy. bring back the classic gameplay elements with modern visuals   game on.
I will always believe she should look in gameplay  like she did in the old cg cutscenes
I really appreciate you mel and for your encouragement. I would like to pray for you over this  I fully get it. I have been in my head a lot lately  however  the verses you have posted lately have been huge reminders for me and God has used you with those timings so thank you. you will continue to be in my prayers it awesome seeing how God is using you. stay you!
Im kind of up for a new game so long as they dont change her look and shove in a woke message. I want an experienced lara croft. plus  I better see lara croft fight dinosaurs this time around.
Im amazed that companies looking to make a new game dont reach out to people like you  who are so knowledgeable about that ip and obviously passionate about it.  companions and road trip  that worked so well for final fantasy xv  sure  go with that.
abby from lou part 2 lol
yup  and tbh I would hate that lol
@melonie mac go boom  I would love to do a trilogy set in the core era about lara becoming lara. the first game would focus on her being rebellious and being disdowned by her perants  the second game would focus on her saving joan ives  from tr4  and cementing their friendship as well as her rivalry with pierre and the third game is about her finding the ark of the covernment.
I hate shadow all I do is move one step die over n over until I figure it out then move again then die over and over until I figure it out again... yeah its not fun at all from my point of view.
@mikepette  yeah  shadow was the worst tr game I have played and I played a lot
I hated how you always had to change when you went into paititI  and that was most of the game!
@pnpride   what about angel of darkness
@buster gundo  ok good point  I have lasted 30 mins in angel of darkness before I dropped hard. let s say shadow would be in my top 3 worst tr games
@pnpride   I beat angel of darkness. never again!what tr game do yourecommend that are not legend aod of the original 4 I was thinking about anniversary or getting the tr trilogy for ps3.
@buster gundo   I beat it  never again  - I have the same feelings about tr 4 which I finally beat 2 years ago d what I would recommend is original tr trilogy 1-3  if u are up for older games- they are all very good . if you beat legend I would advise for anniversary which is next game in crystal dynamics trilogy after legend that you would play which is one of my favourites    from newer ones the reboot and rise of tomb raider are decent entries and I would recommend them. rly depends what kind of era you are looking for - there are so many game to choose from.
all tr game is ez for me hehe I already ended all just waiting the new one
@pnpride  I think anniversary is a remake of tr1.
@buster gundo  it is  they are both so different tho so its worth it to play both of them.
@pnpride  I ll have to find a list of all the main games then cross off what I have beat so far. if I do stream a tr game do you want to be notified
@buster gundo  its on a wikipedia  1996  tomb raider1997  tomb raider ii1998  tomb raider iii1999  tomb raider  the last revelation2000  tomb raider  chronicles2003  tomb raider  the angel of darkness2006  tomb raider  legenda2007  tomb raider  anniversary2008  tomb raider  underworld2013  tomb raider2015  rise of the tomb raider2018  shadow of the tomb raidersure  you can notify me
nothing wrong with a realistic looking lara
they re using an ultra photo-real game engine  and they describe it as  cinematic . I wouldn t hold out much hope.
I agree completely! the new tomb raiders dont feel like tomb raider games at all. 1-3 are the og in my book. tr2 is my absolute fave. the newest one I really enjoyed was the remake of 1 in tr anniversary which is actually pretty old I suppose.  if we could get a remake of 2 and 3 in a form about the same as anniversary  I think that d be lara titties to the max! hell  even if they made a completely original plot similar in style to anniversary I d probably love it.cheers chica  to what hopefully will  but probably wont be a great new tr! also  I love the calling out of the woke madness in society these days! just discovered your channel and had to subscribe! as the hodge twins would say  damn good show! yeahhh!
yeah thatstaue definitely doesnt stand out and everything you said about it was spot of how I feel about it. it just didn t do it justice. the only  t.r. games I played and enjoy is the 2013 and  rise. a new  tomb raider thats looking amazing with a new direction would be fantastic. I do hope look into  angelina jolie version of the character I love those movies. excellent video  melonie  .
release date       cant wait!!!!
I am equally excited and scared for the future of tomb raider.  I want so badly for it to be good but am terrified that they will continue to ruin lara croft.please never stop sharing Bible verses!  this is so great and encouraging!
Im playing through the tr reboot from 2013.  something I haven t played since 2013.  Im discovering how blatant the gameplay was designed to lead you through the story. if you cant solve the puzzle  the game tells you how.
mac is a true tr person I respect her feelings on it and agree 99 percent   saying that I want a new development team studio this series is all over the place
I never played tomb raider back in the day but I liked the character. I agree that the recent games took away from what she is supposed to look like.
lara to me has always kinda been like the female bond. different voice actors  different styles of gameplay  lara may be the same character  she may not be  different backstories  the jolie movies may be the same lara from the classic series  she may not be. thats how I always felt about her. each person has their lara  we ll see how it works out. also  the parents stuff also came from the jolie movies  and the remakes. so  idk  why she s blaming the reboot.
why would people be upset about you sharing your opinions!  if they watch or follow you  then they must accept you. youre 100  you. someone cant just like bits and parts of u and then judge the parts they dont. thats like eating the middles out of oreos then judging the cookie bits for not being good on their own
25 mins. until the end let s you see how much of a sweetheart  melonie really is.
the pre-rendered footage of tomb raider anniversary probably had her best appearance. she was muscular and big boobed. in the game herself  they made her less muscular  though.
learning from sw and marvel let s not get hype so we wont be disappointed. hopefully you get your classic lora back fingers cross
that new statue of her looks more like abbey from last of us 2 than lara croft
hey mellony  Imyself haven t been a big tomb raider fan  I enjoyed the first reboot tomb raider game but the second wasn t great.your love of the franchise and praise of the originals made me go to my local retro game trader and get tomb raider and tomb raider two.any tips for someone brand new those two games
will unified lara be an improvement. hopefully yes. will she be the same or better than classic lara  nope.
I liked some of the set pieces in shadow for sure I really need to replay the origs at somepoint though
hell yeah sister I remember those God of war 2 cinematics were a total reward that blew my mind
the new logo is very reminiscent of the original games  logo. a glimmer of hope  what do you think of it melonie
melonie accidentally spilling the beans on discovering time travel. tell us if this tomb raider s gonna be good or not  will ya   d
also old boy is a korean movie based on a japanese manga. the chinese old boy is a slice of life about a pilot. I think that commenter got them mixed up.
right !
haven t played that in years  how many boss fights are there in that game  I remember counting 2  the big dude when you get one the ship and the fat warrior guy towards the end.
its one of those games thats always reminding you what the  controls are too. you ll get   helpful   reminders  that you cant turn off  of how to aim etc  drives me nuts.
@melonie mac go boom  on another note  could you look at romans 5 1   8 1  then john 3 17
@creativewm_personal  there s the russian in the mountain village  and the village below the castle.
to  unify  new lara with old lara they would have to make her atleast slightly more feminine  but the ideological possesion that created nu-lara hasen t gone away  so I expect unified-lara will still have the following traits short legs  long torso  wide shoulders  broad jawline  small eyes. those are the traits that emediately springs to mind when I think of shadow and rise lara  and I expect those traits will carry over. they might springle in a bit of curve  but those core masculine traits will still be there.
it has better be a reboot  more in keeping with the original 1996 tr  but I have a feeling they wont listen to the fan base  and instead will go in and do their own thing.
melonie I wish the same thing for the ghost recon franchise   _   _   . ubisoft paris said its goodbyes to breakpoint my chains are broken I hope they are making a new ghost recon open world game right now . but hey cool games are coming out looking forward for em hype is on !
let s gooooooooo! I havnt watched yet but Im excited
meloine mac you literally made me think that crystal dynamics made an announcement  of them making a tomb raider game staring the one the only angelina jolie ! do you think it would of been cool  if they or core design made a tomb raider voiced and starred her in it
lol imagine if she was just using her  buddies  as some sociopathic method to get whatever relic she wants  just goes and leaves them to go on her own adventure. this is not going to happen.
oh wow the new  logo  gives me major trc vibes
56 yr old nerdy  girl  gamer here and Im with you!  you keep doing what youre doing and stay strong!
youre awesome. never stop being you.
oh hell yeah  I beat rise and shadow of tomb raider last year  didn t play the first reboot  felt too much like uncharted and far cry  and hoped the would they make a new one where she actually dual wielded 2 pistols. it being on the unreal 5 engine makes me a little interested
melonie  I dont know if you had run into this information yet  but there s a leak of zip s biography for the netflix series. hacker and tech geek. zip was discovered by croft industries after he broke into one of their competitor s databases. they recruited him and continue to pay him handsomely. this leak was revealed months before the announcement of zip s involvement in the series. so I think its likely true. judging by the fact that croft industries has hired him to hack  I think  shows that this show may not be as much of a road trip story as said. in addition  there may be a need to show the tr  chronicles and legend events  such as why lara talks to zip via headset  because many of them clearly happened before tr1. so we may learn of how lara met pierre and larson  for instance. still  its just a theory.edit  when asked about the weta statue being the official unified lara look  crystal responded   accidently  yes.  in addition  the 25th anniversary art became crystal s website logo and live experience logo. did you see thatsame picture with lara s braid  beautiful! here s hoping thats what unified lara will look like! I agree with you about the live experience statue. Im fine with her outfit  but her body is too mediocre. survivor lara looks prettier.
lara should definitely be tall again. 5 9  is not too off for a girl  not everyone is short. for example my little sister is 5 11  and me and my little brothers are all 6 1  . why do action hero characters need to be shorter than people who just walk around  lara could be a very believable 6  if they make her muscular like she used to be.
6 07 the series wouln t be bad if they start this way like lara goes on adventure with her friends if all of them end up dying eaten by monsters or raptors  also betray for survival out of fear  and that exp changes her in to lara fans know and loveI see how some things what u hate about modern lara can be made in to origin story how she becomes that lara u know and loveif they do it that way its okay
your feelings are like my feelings on the new mass effect game. excited about the nostalgia  but overall kind of expecting it to not be good. I want me 1-3  but chances are more than likely we will get an andromeda continuation  in theme  not location . at least itsaves me a bit of money when they toss garbage out and crap on a franchise that used to have millions upon millions of fans.
hey melonie good afternoon. anyway I just want to tell you that I am so stoked and hyped and excited bout this new tomb raider video game news. anyway I can not wait to see how it looks after they get done with making it and after it comes out to video games stores and on youtube. anyway I just want to tell you that and I hope you are very excited bout it too. anyway I hope you have a wonderful and great blessed day today at the gym and hope you continuing to have a wonderful and great blessed day and evening at home with your pets and have a good night too  ok melonie.
from what youre saying  I cantell - you know what s up! and I agree with you 100. you have a lot of good points here!
from now on until the day I die. whenever I think of tomb raider I ll think of you  melonie mac and Im ok with that.
really hope it releases for ps4
I have no stake in the lara croft saga. I was too old for the console generation being a pc nerd. my son however spent hours yelling  swearing and crying at tomb raider jumping puzzles. it was kind of funny to watch.  edit  but if you superimpose the first tomb raider movie with the jolie movie where she played the drug addicted model  you ve got a winner
tomb raider talk starts at 0 00  -
omg im so excited!!
underrated comment.
I think the time has come melgive us your best lara impression let s hear a  oh pierre...you litterbug
your reasons for being wary after hearing an emphasis on  cinematic  and  storytelling  over  gameplay  is exactly why Imostly tuned out of one of the playstation events. the guy that was talking about the announcements insisted on calling the game devs  storytellers  instead of  game developers . this is why that 9 times out of 10 I prefer games made by nintendo or other japanese developers  there s more often than not more emphasis on the gameplay  and I have way more fun with those. not saying there s anything wrong with cinematic games  but when just about everything made in the west  apart from indies  has this emphasis on cinematic experiences over gameplay  its definitely been taken way too far.
you are encouraging  ms mac. Ive been following with you for a while. just wanted to take the time to thank you. you might go your whole life not knowing youre impact  but it doesnt mean you aren t making a difference. you are. hope you get what Im saying. follow your heart.
no  thankyou so much melonie !! get rest and stay stong! keep fighting girl!
tomb raider reflex is strong with this one
more than likely they re going to stick with what they ve been doing since legend. let s face it  companies have shown us time and time again classic fans  really dont matter.
what was fun about the original games on playstation was it was having friends or family over and helping solve the puzzles  thanks
unless they start listening to actual fans Im not really getting my hopes up.
when I heard I wasn t excited but I am curious.
personally  I like the gameplay of the classic series  but I prefer the look and personality of the 2013 reboot lara. Im hoping the new game is a mix of those  with cinematics being occasional or necessary  not just all over the place. I say shadow lara is prob the best lara so far  I d love to see a shadow-like lara in the next game with the classic gameplay and difficulty and if they re bringing companions  only jonah. I only want to see jonah  and only at a central location. I dont want him following me around or anything  he can stay at some base camp and do nothing except help push the story and I ll be fine with it.
ps  from a later comment I noticed  both the asian and american versions of old boy are really good. be careful  though. it will get you with the head games.
man we all know this ain t gonna be what we want
I would make lara croft a very meta character  she has been so influencial thatshe should know she is influential .. and I want the new game to have a scene with lara croft saying thatshe released the tomb raider origin trilogy as her celebrity book .. and she sort of makes fun of how people potrayed her in the games but hey at least it makes her seem more of a sympathetic character rather than an adrenaline junkie who has a passion for adventure  which she could have some shame for it
if you changed the names of the new tomb raider games you would never know what it was supposed to be good games but just not tomb raider
dont feel bad about hurting feelings of people online.  9 times out of 10  you aren t really hurting them  youre just threatening the control their demons have.  you always get the most flack when youre over the target  after all
maybe...  and Im hoping for you that they ve already started the development some time ago and are just saying they just gonna start developing so they wont have to come out with a delay notification later on  ill say a little prayer   now all they need to do is go back to the roots and let lara be lara again  Im thinking of tr1.youre kewl  cu next time.
melonie its happening! we both love tomb raider  give me a high five!
in dmc5 dante and vergil are like 7 feet tall and nothing looks strange about them even though the graphics are realistic looking  they cantotally give lara her long legs!they can make lara look amazing but they choose not to  they do her dirty and give her lame friends and hobbit legs  Im gonna say its not fair to women  production keeps holding her back lol
glad to hear youre feeling better too.
I am so nervous about where the tr franchise is going.
and in this way you can also normalize her talking out loud cuz she is sort of talking directly to you
to deliver the high quality cinematic its dead  jim
I d kill to see them give us a mash of angelina jolie and alicia vikander face! even a little of camilla luddington! I d love for them to bring in a writer who knows the original storyline and just ties everything from the original to the new all together! cause if done right  could be a perfect ending to tie everything together. also enough with the dead parents!!!!!!
keep your expectations low and you will never be disappointed .
and I hope the new game is more classic  tomb raider
maybe the devs thought it would be a good idea to jump on unreal engine 5 like  hey  look at us. we re ahead of the pack and going to use unreal engine 5 before anyone else.
did you see the guy announcing the game  that tells me a lot about what to  expect. having a tlou2 vibes here.
there will always be people that hate on you for speaking the truth.  when the wokies are mad at you  itshows you are doing the right thing. and you will be hated by all for my name s sake. but the one who endures to the end will be saved.  - matthew 10 22also  are you still planning to do the video on aliens   been looking forward to that one ever since you brought it up!
I d like another platformer like tomb raider anniversary. I liked the combat in tomb raider definintive edition  but want a more traditional 3d platformer again. anniversary  I think  it was of the most underappreciated remakes ever -- I think its on par with resident evil remake.
as a metroid samus aran fan  you tomb raider lara croft fans have my sympathies.
announcing the game today means it will be out late 2027 at the earliest.  I cant be bothered to care about this right now.
this is the first time I have ever seen one of melanies videos  lol at first glance I thought the manican in the back was of lara croft. then I noticed her tattoo on her left arm  which looks to be some bad ass chic  so I initially thought  damn this girl is a tomb raider super fan haha. but after a few more minutes of watching  I think I just thought all that because of the main topic haha.maybe she goes over this later in the video  but when she says how crystal dynamics is busy with gaurdians of the galaxy  when that was created by eidos montreal. both part of square enix  but a completely different studio. their is a very small team finishing some of the last of the marvels avengers dlc  but crystal dynamics are actually busy working on perect dark with the xbox 1st party studio the initiative. this tomb raider announcement was pretty much a recruiting tool to get more developers to come work for them over at cd.I totally agree with everything she had to say about the statues though!
I hope its good  also anyone remember those monkey barrel toys.
so  you are saying that if you are a guide for lara or a red-shirt in star trek  you know youre doomed.
shouldn t they waited till they were more in development to announce a new tr game  but idk  idk if lara has to be a loner  as much a cool  and like her og version  Imean I have read some of the classic tomb raider comics along with the classic witchblade  sara pezzinI  and those comics were cool.
mel I dont have faith in them. they ll probably turn lara in aloy   heavy set and manily . hope Im wrong. I started playing underworld again last week.
melonie there is so much more to real life. you do a fantastico job. but you can do so much more.in fact a billion times more. wwg1wga. thank you. peace.
I enjoyed playing around at croft manor. back flipping over the old butler  he made a sound like he was crapping his pants.
wow  will joanna dark and lara croft be doomed
well even if cd creates a tomb raider nobody wants  we have the unreal engine 5 available to the public. in theory we should be able to create a proper tomb raider  and for free
let me read some comments from future videos  the way I snapped my neck on that
bones
my background is all tomb raider. also regarding crystal dynamics and eidos montreal  they are sister studios and they both helped each other on tomb raider  avengers  and the guardians of the galaxy games at some capacity. they work cooperatively  some projects more than others.
bahahaha
the problem I have with this is  when the 25th anniversary started they said they were working on something but now they  just  started  wth
crystal dynamics is growing yet still a small studio. they are not able to do two big titles at the same time.  avengers and tr .
I can already hear lara screaming jonah !!! Im hereeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
God bless you ma am!! we need more people to stand up to th woke bulliez.
I just played angel of darkness for the first time last week not nearly as bad as everyone says.
agree  I wonder do they ever read what people want
it would be great if they went back to classic formula really hard puzzles and traversal  almost like an elden ring adventure game type thing. literally every game nowadays is just a glorified walking simulator. a classic tomb raider game would actually be unique compared to what we have nowadays.
lara croft has the mac factor.
if it isnt real lara croft with skill based parcours and puzzles which actually forces you to think in order to solve the  I aint interested. I want to be optimistic  but I keep my expectations low. I also would like to know if a publisher is involved and of course who  cause that also would tell us a great deal of what to expect.
for me the worst of the reboot was how the player has their hand held and led through the game. I loved tr original because it was so hard and confusing... and unforgiving. just let the player play!
watch it be an epic exclusive on pc...
ngl in regards to gameplay I just want underworld lara back!
man I really really hope they do remake or remaster the very 1st tomb raider game because nothing beats it and was the best game out of the hole series.
hollywood thinks a movie about a single person not saying anything cant be entertaining so it makes sense that netflix is adding the buddies even if its ultimately stupid.
thatstatue still reminds me of my high school gym teacher.
great video  melonie...
no sound on the announcement - was this intentional because of copyright
weird that we re roughly the same age. I like your takes on things. like we had a somewhat parallel upbringing from different parts of the world. lots of good potential conversation vibes. keep up the hard work.
yesss . I really cant wait to lay my eyes  on some more sexy lara goodness . in next generation graphics
supporting this channel
they were probably referencing the pre-production work they were doing and have now just started development proper
it is definitely a buggy game  and was released before it was ready. it was not a bad game in terms of what it was trying to do  however.
I actually love the story of aod and can see where they were going. I wish that was the style of  cinematic experience  we were getting.
@brittany mollo eccles  I 2nd this and I hope that one day we get a remake of the game that includes all of the missing content and actually completes the story
@creativewm_personal  yes! that would be amazing.
dude  maybe you two could date  it d be perfect considering you already know you d have great conversations.
@rob liefeld  that would be on her. sorry I took so long to respond. Im not good with the notices on youtube. Ive been studying the platform and adding my insight as much as I can but my responsiveness outside of the livestream chats can be slow right now. Im better with direct messages on instagram and fb lately but I should evolve more.
@aaron howell  I was being facetious.
@rob liefeld  I wasn t. sorry you live in a small world where the prospect of dating another human being seems like an unrealistic concept.
classic lara with duel pistols
gina carano would make good lara croft in series movie
I think youre doing a fantastic job. your spreading God s word  and you have inspired me more times than I can count. or remember. unfortunately  the internet and youtube and places are not always the friendliest place to be. I just want you to know that I think that youre doing a fantastic job. keep spreading God s word please if you feel that is your calling. if youre confused about that just pray and God will let you know. God bless you and your family and friends. duane.
I love classic tomb raider. I agree with you booms.
decided to wear a lara-esque outfit to talk about the subject  clever.
I generally like the new tomb raider games  in fact they re the reason Im a gamer  but by the time shadow rolled around I think most people were over it  because we all knew exactly what we were getting. we knew there would be nothing new or interesting in that game  just more of the same.so while I love reboot lara and enjoy some of the more action-focused sequences  I really want them to move away from just jumping on the bandwagon with all the sort of....rpg-lite tropes that every triple-a development studio thinks they have to shove into their games these days. the side quests and shops in shadow were just....so not needed. they added nothing to the experience.just for an example  I know elden ring literally is an rpg but they should take a page out of that game s playbook as far as realizing that they can break away from  what everybody expects  and still be successful. they can stop holding the players  hands for one thing. we re hungry for more games that respect us enough to let us figure things out  like fromsoft games do and like classic tomb raider games used to.
oh boy can you imagine what a last of us 2 it ll be
I want you to be happy and feel happy all the time
tho I do enjoy the reboots thoroughly  I wouldn t mind going back to og tr gameplay on ue5
just noticed the cat behind you at 21 30 - thats cute
this announcement feels kind of dumb when they dont even have some concept art!
lara is very alpha woman there s no way
hopefully unified lara will be older and colder  and more jaded...like you are about the franchise. that  and shoot whoever is responsible for qtes.the haters are perpetually butthurt  so dont worry about upsetting them. keep doing what youre doing!
we ve brought in the right team of purple  pink  and green-haired hive-minded worker bees to ensure a simple  cinematic experience thats fair for everyone.  we ve already put much effort into standardizing laura croft so she doesnt offend  and so she appeals to all  but straight white male  gamer types  blah .  hope youre excited as we at cd are!  grab your soy latte and get ready for a happy road trip rumble with laura and friends in the new tomb raider!   coming soon!
tomb raider talk  big shock...
crystal dynamics gets hated on but I like their games so I think they would make a good tomb raider game
1 17 bruh why did the chorus to goodnight moon by go radio start playing in my head
its like they re trying to turn tomb raider into metal gear solid  daughter of indiana jones. they need to do like nintendo does with zelda and mario. stop worrying about  the canon  and  cohesive worldbuilding  and just have a good action  puzzle  dungeon sorry  tomb -delving game. really  itshould be more like devil may cry than metal gear. honestly these days samus is more lara than lara.
hey mel sounds like youre getting discouraged  just remember  youre going against the woke mob  of course they re going to lash out about that. you cant encourage one group without another one getting upset about it  especially when youre going against what has essentially become the status quo. dont let the woke mob get you down  we all love what you do. keep on fighting the good fight.
melonie what do you think of the fortnite lara croft model  thatstatue still looks like teenage me in tomb raider costume.
I feel you m8   I found all 3 good games but after 3rd one Im like same thing  not much dif from last 1  do you think a companion would be cool like the way far cry primal did animals etc or npc
cara  que mulher linda  meu deus
23 32 I thought oldboy was a korean film though  but then again the movie did get a hong kong award in 2005 for best asian film
just give me angel of darkness remake so when the next game tanks ill be less devastated
square enix is losing focus of what makes tomb raider tick. it needs to revert back to the classic adventure style of lara  not a younger version that gets put into harm s way. give us the lara of old!  and while we re at it  how about some blood omen  legacy of kain  its been an eternity!
no more quick time events
bless you mel!
I hope they give lara back her 38 s... and her guns!
unifying the fans...  highly doubt that. og lara to the core  baby.
@melonie mac  if Imade you a theme song and you enjoyed it  would you use it  Ive been thinking about this for a while!!!
I hope they dont go the way of one of the last dlc tombs  for shadow of the tomb raider. lara replaced a relic back to where it belonged. that is not the old lara  they better not make her goody goody two shoes.
I hope the title  melonie mac go boom!  has nothing to do with taco bell.
thank you! amen
old boy is a korean film made by director park chanwook.
cinematic experience   lots of cut scenes and slow-walking exposition.
unfortunately I painfully agree  however I still have hope
I wasn t a huge fan of the old ps1 ones. but I loved the acrobatic skills she had. lara stood out from other characters with her ability to do a backflips while shooting her twin pistols.now its just pick that gun up from this and that guy  and even sneak around and shit. her personality seems just as toned down as her skills.it feels more like an uncharted game now. but lara isn t supposed to be like an every day kind of woman. she is supposed to be this badass athlete with hunger for adventure.
I live for your tomb raider videos!
please give us old school tomb raider!!!
classic 90s lara is best lara
so many tomb raider games and not even a consideration of making a soul reaver game...well  knowing this new tomb raider game is going too be woke makes it more likely that it wont be as successful as previous games.
I wonder which game crystal dynamics will release first.  perfect dark or tomb raider.  they might use the same model.  it would  ave on mocap.
funny I work with them and just finding this out here.
hopefully the new tomb raider game will use the rebooted lara croft  because that game trilogy was so incredibly awesome
she s got legs  she knows how to use them. 13 43
I hate how we have to keep giving up and not following franchises we like and are fans of  I was a fan of assassin s creed but they really wrecked thatstory and changed the game play along with making it a yearly release  it made me just not want to even follow the new stuff anymore. also major franchises like star wars and Lord of the rings  it is so disheartening to me that the original fans are always the ones that get pushed out. I dont know if there is still hope for tomb raider  but melonie is in a position  she knows some people in the games industry  maybe she make a difference before it is too late.
tomb raider needs zombies and lots of shooting and gore.
topic seems right up your alley
first   it is only   your option about tomb raider and as you said something totally unrecognizable. I could say this for tonsof others things as well. but in my option tomb raider along with other classic games have been improved in graphics and gameplay.so if you wish to stay playing classic s type games that is your personal choice. also please know I am not trying to bash you or your thoughts here because I understand we   all gamers   love what we love in game content regardless of when it was released.
I dont know about the story because the last one got hate for cultural appropriation it might be kind of bad and too  woke  but it will look amazing and the marvel games that they just put out weren t the best but  guardians I was pretty good only time will tell
why does everything have to be ue5  Imean I get it....but man Imiss the old days when big studios like cd would showcase new tech and it would be exciting. this especially makes me sad as crystal dynamics were truly cutting edge and to see them sell out to ue5 is just disappointing. I hope they make it thier own enough that it doesnt look like every other ue5 game. the last trilogy for me was mind blowing from a graphics standpoint  especially in 3d.
one look at the person making the announcement tells me everything I need to know about how awful this game will be.
I dont use social media much anymore.   yt and other video platforms are what Imostly do anymore.   life is better.
also  the netflix series has to have buddies  otherwise how do you fit diversity into the show
Im not buying this game unless lara croft is at least a d cup
I read the Bible for the first time last year  and the main takeaway I found is that nothing in life is guaranteed except the presence of God. and the peace that brings my soul - I cant control outcomes  sometimes things just wont go the way you think they should  and life is very unfair and unpredictable  but God s presence remains and he is the one constant. love the verse of the day!
youre not upsetting people  they are upsetting themselves with their own intolerance.
this is just epic puffing ue5.
the original oldboy is korean cinema. also my favorite movie! fyI  dont watch the american remake its garbaje!
I know what you mean man.kain and raziel...ahhh good memories.
nah
in ways  not shadow though    but it wasn t really tomb raider  and lara wasn t lara either.

I liked the american version. I didn t see the korean version of the movie though. so I wouldn t say the american version is trash per say.
I will withhold my excitement until I see what it looks like. more than likely it will be the  evil male gaze  bs etc. I really cannot bring myself to get excited for any new games like I used to.
do we really need another tomb to raid
holler if its 2022 and youre still trying to activate the nuderaider code on ps1
in a life lived for Christ  there is no room for despair.
controversial opinion  I reallyyyy hope they recast lara
some people s idea of free speech is that they are free to say what they like  but if anyone says anything back  that is an outrage.
wow youre talented
we do they always announce games when they have nothing to show   that is so stupid. love your contant melonie. greetings from germany
and now how do you suggest they have a tv series of her being alone by herself  do you understand that tv and video games are completely different mediums
sounds like at least 2 years off.
old lara croft is what feminists say they want women to be.new lara croft is what feminists actually want women to be.
the reboot trilogy was awesome not sure why you dislike it
they will probably have lara croft wearing shoulder pads and a crash helmet gotta keep her safe and a turtleneck cos you cant have skin showing and a big box of tissues when she keeps crying so much Imake sure I have a squeegee for my pc monitor so when she cries I can wipe off the tears.
the pleasure I receive from eating right  drinking right  and overall investing in myself daily  working out for instance  is more satisfying and profitable than counterfeit pleasure from eating wrong and giving in to licentiousness.
the weta statue looks the way it does cause weta wants to sell statues make money.
I want to be excited for this melonie but sadly I know they will make lara more masculine looking like in the last game or look like thatstatue they built for her recently. 10 12  but I hope Im wrong and they give us the lara we want finally.
hopefully the next tomb raider will actually be good looking. the first reboot was just fine but rise and shadow  well  they made her forgettable
thatstatue looks like a male lara stuntman in a wig on the set of a tomb raider movie.
bring back the classic music!!!! pleaseeee  tr isnt the same.
woked up lara to 11 incomming.
there s always another tomb  always more loot.
@dying rose  well sure but not this soon.
@senseofreality  not in this culture!
its a tactic to build hype.
lara croft tomb raider starring angelina jolie was very good. I think melonie s only issues was parents storyline with the movie. also tomb raider cradle of life nailed lara as well.the original tv series of tomb raider  revisioned  tomb raider  also nailed what tomb raider and lara is suppose to be like. it can be done   !
@ladylaracroft96  the angie film she had friends and companions. she was only alone for five minutes in it. the revisioned series was a 5 minute separate episodes thing  you cant possibly compare that to a half hour season long tv show.
I think they re great games  but they are not true tomb raider games
I am literally waiting for the concept art. if she looks square and beefy  its woke garbage.
I just wonder if with all the puritan sexists in the industry if we ll ever see classic lara s design again
unfortunately  the word  fans  no longer applies to actual fans that have been around for multiple entries of a franchise.  fans  now infers either casuals or twitter-bots. the decline in quality gaming comes almost exclusively from corporate greed and woketivism. its sad... actually pathetic  tbh. corporate decides to chase the woke and casual trends  while practically everyone is screaming at them  dont do it! . get woke  go broke. somewhere along the way  game companies forgot who actually pays them- the consumer. they decided to decide what was going to be popular  and they re determined to force it down folks throats until they love it.
everybody is swapping to unreal engine 5. I think imma buy some more shares of unity lol.
melonie  you should consider being more involved in your church. Im sure they have plenty of volunteer opportunities or better yet consider doing a short-term missions trip. a few months in a foreign country away from everything teaching God s word would do you a lot of good. if you aren t willing to make such a big commitment  consider joining a big sisters program. society needs more women like you and I think you would make a great mentor. the wokies have control of almost every institution so its up to people like us to teach the next generation.
me thinks you need glasses.  her legs dont look short.  it may seem that way because of theboots she s wearing  but as I look at itshe has normal legs and looks like she s 5 6 or so.
lara s masculine jaw will be more defined than ever in unreal engine 5.with our new hair technology  marvel at the individual strands of stubble  on her now shaved head.watch the non-physics of her now abby-esque pectorals.in tomb raider 2022.
my favorite tomb raider by far is tomb raider anniversary. its a remake of the very first original tomb raider with the same engine as tomb raider legends underworld. the tombs and puzzles are the very best
that anniversary picture does look off.  maybe if the right leg had better shadowing to show how much it is being bent.
I never saw the point of not doing autograb. I always used to jump and immediately hold grab and it worked so having to manually grab was just an inconvenience.
her words are fair
the word  cinematic  raises definite alarm bells. because we have no real information  fans think there is a possibility that they will go back to a classic style lara character and adventure. I wish it were so but its probably not going to be the case. it would be great if they took inspiration from  resident evil 2  remake . that had a modern engine and production budget but still somehow felt like the original and almost everybody  including fans of the original  loved it.its better to have lower expectations for next  tomb raider  and be pleasantly surprised than have to have high expectations only to have them dashed yet again.
the thing Ive always found funny about modern female hero video games is they always have a bow  and programmers who have never used a bow  or fired a gun  are too stupid to realize that regular recurve bows take a large amount of upper body strength in order to draw the bowstring back  and then hold it there while aiming and firing the arrow.  for hunting you need a 40 to 60 lbs draw weight and the vast majority of women are incapable of drawing back a recurve bow because they simply dont have the muscle to do so.
if its nu fake lara Im not interested. I want the old lara back
the length of her legs put me off right from the start in that reimagined art. first we re told that busty and curvy women are  unrealistic .but an above average height woman with athletic  longer legs is unrealistic too I see plenty of progressive minded gamers praising tall  athletic women like samus  but the game developers are doing exactly the opposite by making female characters short.
tomb raider let me guess she want to be a lesbian for lesbian points lmao
everyone is going unreal engine 5. I am worried my current computer wont be able to keep up so Im  less than thrilledyour take on the original lara versus the new evolving character we see now is dead on. original lara was nothing like this current version and frankly I have zero interest anymore which is sad.
I am expecting not to buy this game at this point  sadly.just how it is after the last release  and maybe not finding this dev as trustworthy.
bring back og lara  cheeks
God saves his toughest challenges for his greatest warriors. know that you are serving him! I know because a few weeks ago I was at the lowest I have ever been. you spoke about how reading your Bible has helped you and how it takes work. so I started to read mine again and within a few weeks my life has changed. God showed me my path forward and healed me. I wasn t going to share because its a very personal thing to share in the internet but I want you to know you are making a difference!
it will be woke.
I bet money that her hair will be a pixie cut.
anniversary is a very watered down version of tr1  but the manor is amazing at least!
@melonie mac go boom  its very faithful and no tank controls
well  games have never really been about realism to begin with  but its a fair point. guns are much easier to use.
there are plenty of tall athletic women with very curvy figures and long legs in sports. why cant game developers take inspiration from those  one really good example is the german sprinter alica schmidt  5 9   who would make an ideal body type for lara croft.
I second this prophecy.
these days I cant get excited about games. these days I think they will find a way to force woke in it. truth be told as a straight white dude im just tired of it. I remember when video games were just fun and got us away from the real world . not bash us on the head with it. I was born in 1980 and to me was back when games were focused on just fun. guess I am just old now but still have fond memories of ocarina of time and majoras mask. these days I spend more time on my ps3 then I do in modern games. given they just relied on story not who bangs whom.
Bible verse   but I will sing of your strength  in the morning I will sing of your love  for you are my fortress  my refuge in times of trouble.
facts
I just need the badass  stylish  sarcastic  gymnast lara back  she used to be someone you wanted to know and be friends with while the rebooted lara is just whiny and dull  she seems like someone who is painfully boring to be around. I really hope they give us lara with more modern gadgets  twin pistols and less sociology-student-looking  unfashoinable outfits.
you cant please everyone all the time  you can please some people all the time or please everyone none of the times  there is value in what you do  there is value in a different respectful opinion in this hivemind mentality intolerant world  I was really saddened to hear that you feel like you dont have a fulfilling life  I wish you success in mending that
sadly I think she ll be a woke  androgynous  sjw  wamen who dont need no man character because thats what has happened to aaa game studios. they masculinized alloy in forbidden west for example.
quick quesition  I played all tomb raider games except  angel of darkness and chronicles.I heard that these are the worst tr games.are they worth playing or should I just watch a lets play
only tomb rider game I have plyad was tomb rider 3 on ps1 what I had long time ago
isn t laura supposed to be quick and agile  how is she supposed to do that with hobbits legs  hobbits are known as hardy  not nimble.
we will see in time  if its woke I wont even try it. be careful crystal dynamics  make it about the game and not about being gender neutral or non binary
melonie  how do you feel about volunteering  I do habitat every once in a while and its a good combination of exercise and helping others.
lara in the recent reboot is a sociopath disconnecting from humanity as she continues to find it easier to kill people than reason with them. I loved that lara because Ive wanted them to explore how she became the version of tomb raider we knew. it never happened but it was the whole point. creating a realistic story for how someone could become the lara we had known. she enjoyed killing in those games. its silly and not so serious buy its still killing  and flirting  and sometimes at the same time. but after the second game in the reboot series they kind of just dropped it and all the games ads were like  she finally becomes tombraider  Im like uh  when
26 45 humble flexing
honestly  who cares about which big epic engine they re using  tr games have looked phenomenal these past few years  that has never been the issue. the issue is  that no matter how pretty they make them  the gameplay is still boring and linear  the storylines are terrible  and lara s characterization and appearance keeps getting worse.
current crystal dinamics and beautiful women is like oil and water.most western companies are like oil and water when it comes to character design. even when they have character creation implement they barred you just enough to stifle ur creativity. so expecting to see some butch lara  cause the trust ain t there
everything in moderation - take the reboot lara  dial up her athleticism  which will naturally give her a more curvy figure   if its a continuation of the reboot then we ve had the origin story and they can make her a badass from the get go without having to build her to that point. can have more puzzles while maintaining incredible aesthetics rather than one or the other..I feel like while she should be solo in the field and for long periods  but dont see why she shouldn t have a couple of people to ground her between expeditions or touch base with.you mentioned before about chaotic neutral leaning - I agree she should be chaotic but would want her to have a good lean. I recall there was a lot of criticism about the reboots because of leaning to the not caring about people enough
its impressive how similar tomb raider reboot is to 2019 s 2nd worst game left alive from the front mission series  also by square enix . both forgot their cores to become overdramatic survivals with crafting  stealth and endless gunfights. the difference is that reboot tomb raider has more publicity  but its still always behind uncharted  which is far more similar to classic tomb raider than the reboot itself. and is more sold although its a ps exclusive and tomb raider is multiplatform.
I think the short legs in the image... could others perspective of the image  like she s leaning forward
melonie  if people are going to be upset that you are reading the Bible and praying in a video  and your takes on tomb raider and stuff in general  then it means those guys where never your fans to begin with  dont even bother interacting with them  dont allow them to live rent free in your head. everyone will have haters  even the gold standard for mixed race  brittany ventI  has haters for no apparent reason. these haters  these trolls non of them live in the real world  just remember that the next time you try to get bummed. count yourself lucky that you are living in a better situation than most of us. Im living in my parents house  Im 24 and in unI so dont judge   that has coachroaches in the kitchen  kitchen cabinets that could fall on you and have termites  dogs that appear from nowhere and came back the same way they left  green swimming pool filled with algae    I have a crummy laptop thats falling apart  I feel defeated some times. and I ask God  why dont you just end me right here and then  but for some reason he gives me the strength to keep going. Ive been through worse  Im still going through worse  you cant let a few haters bring you down fam.
she better have buns hun.
shadow is the worst.
@dying rose  have to agree.shadow was very boring and underwelming
@carl schildhauer  my favorite part was mowing down paititI warriors with automatic rifles.
@dying rose  yes fun times
you know  I gotta give them those 5 minutes in shadow where she s really  really pissed and starts mowing down dudes though. it was too little  too late and not exactly clever but it was a well overdue glimpse at the old badass lara and her classic idgaf attitude. and if not that  it was a welcome change of pace from all the whining she did over those 3 games lolI gotta be honest though  I love those games. but I d never argue they haven t lost the essence of what tomb raider was. they re more uncharted with a female lead than anything else.
what is gameplay supposed to be  reason with npcs with guns mode  video games require action  ....  reason   ya ok dude.
the people she was killing were trying to kill her and other people... and she does have a mental breakdown at the devastation after the flood....she also gets enraged when she thinks ruorke  has just murdered jonah. she s also kind to npc s she helps in side quests.hardly traits of a sociopath.
y all haven t looked into all the side stuff in the second game. the stuff that peeks into her life between the event s. she s paranoid and she s all over the news being called crazy like her father. her uncle has all her assets and can hold on to them until her mental health is confirmed stable enough. her psychiatrist suggests thatshe likes the power she felt when she took people s lives. she said herself in the first game it was scary how easy it was. when she doesnt get what she wants she sometimes thinks about how easy it would be to kill people and take it. she even considered killing her own uncle. her moms side of the family was shit to them her whole life. these things happen back in regular society.
one leg is up and the other is behind her. that back leg should have way more length than it does. she looks 5 0  tall with those proportions
I cant type. Imeant to say the perspective  but you knew that.I do think its more cause she s leaning forward  but to each their own.great job on the channel btw. love they Christian tie ins and how you stand up to the wokies. God bless.
Im not hyped. this is crystal dynamics we re talking about. a western  woke company under square s thumb.it wasn t so bad during the reboot trilogy  but now  dont expect a good game to come out of this.
im hoping its more like rise of the tomb raider over shadow.
Imean I dont hate reboot lara she s fine but I just want classic lara and reboot lara to coexist
was totally agreeing with you on the actual tomb raider aspect of the video  but why did u start talking about philosophy and diet and relationships during the later half of the video    I thought we were talking about lara
life is most fulfilling with a family. gear down your internet time and take that next step. the world would be a better place with a mom mac.
as a fan of tr I understand everything youre saying. I get it. on the other side of the coin at least to me sometimes its cool to see characters evolve. is the new trilogy perfect  no. everything has flaws. my main problem with  rise and shadow  was jonah constantly popping up. I agree she doesnt need a sidekick. that particular angle works better with uncharted. both are based on indiana jones though Ive always seen lara as being closer to that image. as far as classic lara  I dont see how that d work in the present day. even if there were elements of that dipped into new games like the dual pistols or her iconic sunglasses people online would always find something to cry about. nothing wrong with criticism but sometimes people online can be a bit wacky. I remember the classic games but its highly unlikely we ll get something along those lines again. maybe elements sprinkled here and there but not entirely. I d rather remember the classic games as they were because it would only be ruined in today s era.
I loved every tr game until aod  and I doubt this game will be anything special.
I hope this is the sassy sexy laura we all knew and loved I did enjoy the reboot trilogy though I have a bad feeling there going to cater to the woke crowd and make her manly
1 55 I think this video wasn t needed because as you said there was nothing to get from it  except  for me  irrelevant blabber . we know there will always be a next tomb raider game because its draws money  so if the point was to let us know they were making another game  that video is a waste of ressources and time.6 20 you summed up pretty much every classic players concerns and matters and what basically went into oblivion along with core design. 8 10 here we go again but that goes with the crystal dynamics package. at least when they threw in any kind of support character in the classic it was tasteful and they weren t stealing scenes  lara was the main character and now its lara and her company.for the comparison of lara s looks they are indeed now trying to make her more relatable and less flamboyant. which is a pity. everyone loved the practical and fierce yet feminine lara  current lara doesnt work for me if the game wasn t called tomb raider nobody would even notice or scream plagiarized because its not it anymore. she could pass for an uncharted character not tomb raider she lacks charisma in her looks and in her personality sorry I had to throw in my 2 cents out of frustration of course there is some moments in those games where Im clutching my seat and Im like okay this is still tomb raider but that has nothing to do with the actual lara and I also feel like they are milking the hell out of this transition if that makes sense. honestly each time they announce a new tomb raider Im just waiting for cd to be done with this lara.
they made the most annoing lara ever with the last trilogy  woke is killing lara making her another thing not lara
cinematic . thats everything you need to know that its gonna suck ass. all the time that games continue going down the path of ultra-realism  and aspiring to be another medium they will never improve. games are not movies. they are better than that.  or they could be... . dont hide the actual gameplay  i.e. tomb raiding  away as an optional side activity that you are somewhat ashamed of  because it doesnt look good on a flashy showreel at the game awards . also  the idea that you need the absolute latest graphics tech in order to tell a good story is such a crock of shit. rhianna pratchett 2.0 will still be writing a boring  mopey lara with no agency.
honestly  I dont trust a tomb raider game coming out in 2022  especially in an era plagued by wokeness and saturated with far-left ideologies. truthfully  I look at any new series with a female lead with a hint of suspicion since  Imean  the last of us 2....
melonie  I thought you said you weren t calling your  new channel  anymore.  is it just a habit thing at this point to call it that
girl next door    she s a millionaire s daughter who grew up in a mansion and traipses around the world looking for ancient artifacts - she s anything but the  girl next door .  how can you say there s nothing spectacular or stand-out about her after she survives that first island - ala oliver queen - and becomes fricking rambo in the third game   I feel like youre so invested in dismissing this latest trilogy that you ve blinded yourself to what a great character the new lara is.  as much as you loved those originals  I love this new take on the character and since - as you admit - the character changes so often  your version is no more valid than mine.
it doesnt matter what it is  any time they mess with originality  it aways screws it up and ruins the story!!
bruh Im only like 3 minutes in and all you ve said basically boils down to  I hate any tomb raider games that crystal dynamics has made including the legend trilogy and just want the old ps1 games but with better graphics  and literally all we got from the announcement was that there s a game coming being made with unreal 5 and thats it.how tf do you make a nearly 30 minute video just hating on all the new tomb raider games including the one thats not even out yet when there s been basically nothing shown or talked about with the new game like they re probably barely starting on the concept art stage and you already wanna rate this game a 0 out of 10.
if you dont like growth  stick with classic. her hand to hand fighting multiple guys  and raptors wasn t believable! the latest version was better. old lara was a mary sue like rey in disney star wars which is the current queen of women power fantasies.the latest version gave lara a hero s journey.
hate it correct you  but eidos montreal worked on guardians  crystal only worked on avengers
I dont want  next level storytelling   I want less storytelling and better gameplay. and of course  classic lara.
is lara going to be gender neutral in this one
just about anything  movie or games  with a female lead ever since ghostbusters 2016 has been questionable  though I think tomb raider 2013 may have started that dreadful trend. playing the tomb raider reboot trilogy itself ruined my enthusiasm for games with female leads or choosing female characters. these past years Ive been playing games just with male characters  even those that provide both gender options. the only recent game Im found myself enjoying a female lead was an unlikely modern jrpg gem called trials of mana remake. I also played tales of berseria  but I found the female lead in that one really annoying for me to truly appreciate. until they start making female characters quite appealing  personality wise and fun to  gaze at   Im gonna be very selective and mostly focus on stuff with male leads or just choose male characters.
I said once I hit 50k subs I wont call it my new channel any more
@melonie mac go boom  aha!  Imisheard you when you said it  cool cool.  well  Im shooing as many people as I can your way  you ll get there soon.
the original lara did what she wanted because she could  she didn t need her parents to motivate her to raid tombs and in fact they were against this adventurous phase she was going and actively disowned her. she became rich by writing about her exploits and garnering a fanbase who enjoyed her adventures of daring do  reboot and survivour lara dont have thatsame spark the original did.
@creativewm_personal  she had a different spark  where she was inspired to follow her father s work and discover the things he never could.
@maehedrose  problem is that the dead parents subplot has been done to death in the tomb raider franchise from the comics  movies  books and the post core era games. at some point it becomes very cliched to a strong woman character needing to follow in their dead parents footsteps everytime as the sole motivating factor behind them doing what they do  in fact the lead writer rhianna pratchett hated having to adopt this subplot when she was writing the story for the survivour series.
funny how youre mad about my judgments based on little information when you yourself also made judgments off of only 3 minutes of my video lol
its the trend of gaming that is troubling. the odds that we ll get a lara like the og lara are very low. feminism is being masculinized and then called strong  rather than just making strong females that rely on traits that are not necessarily masculine. its a strange paradox in the industry  and its not winning any points. in fact  its pushing real fans away.
@melonie mac go boom  I watched further into the video than that I just made my comment when I was that far in the rest was honestly much the same though with you basically just saying what you d like to see from the series with them going back to lara being more of an  amazonian  to quote your wording around the halfway mark.
@dying rose  honestly I dont even disagree with most of what she said I just dont get how she s able to make a 30 minute video with so little information so far.also to ad to your statement the way most of the industry has been going makes me happy that platinum games exist and have stuck to their guns with bayonetta cause she s still being a badass lady that uses her charm and has a sexy feminine figure on top of it all  she s basically more like old school lara than the actual tomb raider games these days lol.
@theninjamaster67  what the..  my comment was deleted  anyway dude  she s passionate. thats all. you can pretty much see her talking about tr on videos that have nothing to do with it. kind of a running joke.. and its interesting to think about where tr could be going  especially at this point in the franchise with this current culture. like  Im 75  sure it will be a disaster.as for bayonetta  yeah  she s one of the last strong female characters that are unapologetically feminine  not a surprise being a japanese inspired character . dont know why western devs are so afraid of the female form..
@theninjamaster67  if you know remotely anything about me  I cantalk about tomb raider for hours with little to no excuse to do so. this 30 minute video could have easily been 2 hours lol
@dying rose  youtube deletes comments sometimes even when I tick the box not to
@melonie mac go boom  Ive only seen one of your videos before but I do get that vibe from you lol also my personal opinion on tomb raider is I d personally just like them to remake all the games in the style of that tomb raider 2 fan game by nicobass cause despite growing up with the original games and liking the story I never was a fan of how difficult they could get but I liked the voice actor and the story was super interesting.
@melonie mac go boom  uh-huh.. its cause of that jingle-bells reference  wasn t it
cd and em worked on avengers and guardians both together at some capacity. they are sister studios of sorts.
Im tired of the false dichotomy we seem to have established both here and with other aspects of gaming. these things  storytelling and gameplay in this situation  are not mutually exclusive  you can absolutely have great storytelling and a great gameplay experience. lowering your expectations in this way  by accepting a decrease in quality in one area that you personally may not care about  but the rest of us certainly do  as a trade off for better quality in another area  allows game devs to get away with taking our money for a subpar product. instead we should all demand more from the people we re giving our money to.
it ll be a semI interactive movie like every other western made game  and not even a good movie.
day 26 of commenting on your videos until g-fuel sponsors me.call me a skeptic but Im not exactly hopeful. I didn t even finish the latest trilogy because its not my lara croft... my first love
yeah  dont remind me
cool
its gonna be woke like everything else lol
tomb raider comming soon ps4 l want an answer
nice to have sexy fun lady your right about how games have changed Im kinda old school
dont be afraid to upset people with the truth
I dont care about lara crofts choice of clothing. of course she is sexy from head to toe but the main probs with her reboot trilogy was her lack of confidence or a I daring playful attitude towards dangerous situations and thats a big put off.
I never really got into tomb raider personally
press e to touch the grass
unreal engine. game published by square enix. epic store lamesclusive confirmed.
we just every female characters in video games to stay attractive  sexy  bloodthirsty  adventurous  intelligent  hot  tech savvy  sweaty  easy on the eyes  ruthless  energetic  awesome  slim  amazonian  muscular  scantily clad  curvy  slim-thicc  talented  alluring  unparalleled  deadly  calm  focused  cool  gun toting  heroic  villainous  got class  experience  steely  disciplined  friendly  powerful  patriotic  be someone s role model  honorable  seductive  good looking   loving.yeah  I said it. dont censor me   dont take my words out of contextwe want them to stay that waythey need to leave them alonethey always get offended over fictional  digital characters that isn t any of their damn business
she gots man hands.  leavelaraaloooone
he said cinematic that means it would have sucked.
psalm 42 11
amen
hopefully they go back to basics and get rid of survival laura. the game is called tomb raider not camp raider. I didnt care for the last few games. Imean they wasn t bad but they definitely are not the tr games I love and miss playing.
Im going to have to disagree. her legs do not look short. then again I really only got into two of the games  the original and the reboot. just dont get the  short legs  feel from that image.
guli!
new laura is gonna be super lame - callin it now
nothing more than just an endorsement of the ue5 engine. I hear nothing new about tomb raider from that announcement
crystal dynamics better not listen nor bend the knee to those malicious fake fans   feminists on twitter
weird this video is not showing as being watched. its not showing up in my history or anything. well here s a second view
just wait until sony acquires squire enix and then microsoft buys out sony then before you know it lara croft will have blue hair and a y chromosome.
youre never getting the classic games youre describing lol
Im just going to keep it real the tomb raider survivor trilogy is trying to imitate the uncharted trilogy from naughty dog and the problem is lara croft isnt likeable enough to pull of a plot that basic and their side character in jonah is good but hes not great like sully elena chloe or even charlie in unchated 3 they need to hire better writers if they want to continue with this movie cinematic style
oldboy is korean.
cinematic experience ....get out. thats one of the reasons why I stopped playing most aaa games. I often just want to play a game.dont get me wrong some of my fave games are cinematic experiences  i.e  mgs  death stranding   quantic dreams games  until dawn....   but I dont want every game Godamn game to be like that.
a roadtrip            hshshshshshhahaha what
hip part is too low and the torso s too long. that gives a feeling of being short.
I think its high time we got a black transgender lesbian lara who identifies as a mushroom.
a new tomb raider huh  I hope she stays sexy  fit  athletic   busty
I could watch you talk about lara s body all day long. if you weren t religious  I would marry you.
so is this game going to address the river of blood lara swam through all the while full of open cuts  in the 2013 game for as real as they tried to make the new games crap like that get s on my nerves no way lara doesnt have a boat load of std s.
I hope these ppl realize they should be tryin to be more like dark souls than uncharted
I dunno about this
I think uncharted started the cinematic style of game and obviously reboot tomb ride copy it. I like cinematic games but its just too much especially in western games
lara s shorts need to be shorter
hey mel  any good suggestions for Christian music
this was basically hey unreal engine 5  yeah we are using  that now...... oh and tomb raider is still a game bye lol. I hope the goal for this tomb raider is to return lara croft back to her former glory but then I remember the woke morons we are dealing with it would  he such a easy home run for them but we know they way to afraid of the angry twitter mob   the activist games jourmos.
not for a loooong time or ever sadly
@melonie mac go boom  personally  I love the direction they are going considering that I really loved the reboot lara and camilla luddington s portrayal of her  but I understand how classic fans feel like they aren t being heard. tbh I think the only way to solve this problem will be to release remakes of the classics with heavy input from the classic fans. the new game will be  classic lara  through a survivor timeline lenses  which Im game for and was something I was expecting  but I hope classic fans manage their expectations like you  because this will not be the rebirth of classic lara like some expect.
lara should be renegade. she doesnt need support characters or a  team   just good ol  classic lara kickin  butt and taking treasures.
@dying rose   it wont matter if the story is trash like rise of the tomb raider and shadow of the tomb raider most of the screen time was lara vs trinity and thatsimply isnt compelling enough of a story to have that many cutscenes and quick time events
@steven kennedy  so there should be more gameplay.
@dying rose   gameplay was fine they had enough side content weapons skins etc to keep you entertained the issue is the main story was trash so your desire to finish the game is low and your desire to do everything in the game is low when the story is trash while tomb raiding becomes glorified side quests
her legs are literally way too short  its not an illusion. they are stumpy lol
not like either honestly. lara is suppose to be very op. they should be aiming for being like tomb raider and not any other series. her acrobatics absoutley needs to be in gameplay  her duals should be pretty obnoxious and of course have unlimited ammo. the thing thatshould be challenging is the tombs and the puzzles and trying to progress not the actual combat as lara is basically superhero like
@ladylaracroft96  Imean dark souls as in  dont hold players hands.. less cutscenes... solitary exploration.. environmental storytelling.. not an interactive movie like uncharted. itshould be more like dark souls  more like it used to be.
worship  getty worshipmusic  capital kings  bizzle  priesthood  leeland
they turned her into a female version of bruce wayne with the family stuff but forgot to give her a personality  or a spine in some cases. bit of snowflake.
do youreally need twitter
doing omad  long term mental self is a hundred times better  lost 30lb
honestly  instead of watching them continue to screw up tomb raider. id much rather them just let the franchise die.
they ll probably make her trans like abby.
I just know the anime is going to be garbage
I skipped the original tomb raider games. I dont know what I purchased instead  limited budget made me choosy. sounds like original lara was a femme fatale.
hI  just started your video.
I just noticed that the laura statue doesnt even have pistols. why the heck does she even have the holsters  was holding pistols too extreme  geez  what a dull loser version of croft.
I hope they dont have jonah in the new game. he got annoying after the second game
jonah is a chad
its the way  lara doesnt even look lara. the recent game s    projects dont feel like tomb raider  they feel like a whole another franchise. lara looks so generic theres nothing special about her. from what once used to be a pop culture icon to a boring girl-next-door. I agree with the whole angelina jolie thing  lara might ve been british but she looked so  exotic  her features were not that of a white british woman. also  they need to stop making her body proportions like shes shooting testosterone every other day  shes buff but not  feminine buff and its sad because the whole company said they re trying to  not be sexist  or  sexualize  her but its really goes to show that you cant be a badass without having a male looking body and one thing classic lara did was serve body  face and looks   heavy on that   and kick ass.
we are on the same page
wow... oldboy is hong kong  its korean if you gonna try to highlight shit be accurate
they need to step away from making it the  last of us 3 . enough with the shooter stuff. more puzzles more backstories more adventure. less whining and axes.
I hear marvel   dc are doing things  I dont get excited anymore.  someone died  they will bring them back from the dead.  I also know the books are going to preach nietzschen communist beliefs.
hmm
if they make another mary sue like the rise and  shadow of the tomb rader im boycott this franchise.
wtf you still around
makes a big difference for my work  yes
@melonie mac go boom  my condolences
I could see them attempt to make her like half black..
Im not even gonna waste my time with it lol
its gonna be wokewashed garbage. I already know. everything these days is. I have absolutely no faith in the entertainment industry anymore. haven t for quite some time now.
I really hope they dont bring back sam. that fucking  ship  bullshit is so annoying and its only for woke points. lara doesnt need a love interest at all
...she ll be body positive  blue haired  nose ring  dr martens....oh  and a non binary  kale eating black lesbian.    thatshould do.
omg.... not a friends roadtrip.... this franchise is lost. just like saints row
oh... another game about what was my favorite franchise and my favorite eroine in videogames.and Im not thrilled at all. I even dislike the idea.
lara has become more whiny and wimpy as the years go by  I wonder how much sjw crap they can stuff in the new game
their marvel stuff was trash. I dont care about what it looks like just as long as the auto aim crap is gone and there is more exploration and puzzles. if the story is good like the witcher 3  I dont mind cut scenes.
uh oh. this is not good. given the current state of the industry there is a very high chance this game is going to be some lame always online live service microtransaction filled nonsense with an overly masculine and buff lara croft that has the jawline of a man and that dumb looking lobotomy cut hairstyle the sjw s like so much. until I see evidence to the contrary Im just going to assume this new tomb raider game is going to be some woke pandering crap  because the game development industry seems to be neck deep into the woke cult. so  hard pass for me. I ll rather stick to the old games. you know  the ones that were made before the wokies took over the world.
hooray  another lacklustre game with faux lara croft.
new series and game  picnic raider .. at least gives us graphically updated classic game reboots!!!!!
hI boomster woomster.
there are a lot of games that aren t woke garbage. you just have to dig for them.then again I have a huge backlog to get through.
@buster gundo  oh Im sure there are mate. its just that with the over saturation of horrible unfinished  trend-chasing games out there. I tend to stick to older games mostly. I have a huge backlog of games that haven t been touched as well lol
@spazattack215   I can definitely agree with you on the amount of buggy broken  censored games out there. if more companies took pride in their work we would have a lot less of a problem.I have been checking out indie games as well as grinding my backlog down. I do that by spinning a wheel with all the backlogged games on it then playing the game it lands on.
