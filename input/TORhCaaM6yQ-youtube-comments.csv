Im very excited for this movie  I think that peach can be a  strong woman  as long as she works with her male counterpart and not treat him like a dunce
my problem with peach isn t thatshe s confident but rather what we ve seen of her confidence. peach has always been class over sass in how she expresses herself in more active roles. Im hoping that the final product will show some of that without making her overpowered. I also wouldn t mind if they pitched the voice just slightly so itsounded a little higher and softer. personally  Ive always like the trope of the highly feminine badass. she s prim and proper but she s also capable of holding her own. that duality has always been a fun concept to me.
I am genuenly scared that peach is gonna feel more like daisy  but so far I think it looks generally great.I like it  I just hope they dont exagerate to the point it doesnt feel like princess peach. but I dont think they will  mostly because if peach was already enough of a strong character then why would they need mario  who seems to need a lot of training  in the first place  I think things are gonna be alright.
there s a very fine line to walk  itseems. a strong female character is a delight in a lot of adventure stories. but 1  being strong doesnt mean bullying or talking down to others  like a lot of modern writers think it is  and 2  a strong character s story and setting dont bend around them.so long as the story doesnt tear mario and luigI down to elevate peach and so long as peach isn t rude and doesnt teleport out of chairs  amazon s wheel of time-style   I dont see an issue. but Ive been fooled before
my guess is that the princess summoned mario and luigI for help because she could not defeat bowser on her own so that gives me hope that this will be a traditional-ish hero movie.  miyamoto-san will not nerf mario for wokeness.  I have faith!
you hit the nail on the head. they dont seem to be changing her character  and the way she interacts with mario is not a problem. even mario failing at things in the trailer is fine if you ask me. he s just found himself in a new world  and is dealing with things he needs to adjust to. it looks like he gets used to it though  with the mario kart scene.
bowser makes a cameo in the movie  wreck-it ralph   where he does not have any lines and is mainly shown drinking from a styrofoam cup. nintendo told disney to reanimate him because of how he was drinking the tea was not how bowser would drink his tea and they were misrepresenting him. if nintendo thinks how a dragon turtle drinks tea in his one and only scene misrepresents the character  then I have high hopes that the characters are all going to remain the same personality-wise
I wondered the same when I saw the trailer  but after talking with a friend  this does seem like an origin where mario is now being introduced to this new world so he isn t well versed within it  and for the moment princess peach is well the princess leader etc. so she is doing what she deems necessary to protect her world but then the way I see it going  is bowser will kidnap her as is always the case lol and mario will have to step up lol
Imean  you cant really be surprised that people are really skeptical after every time they promise a certain character and then sideline them in their own story. I like you because you always come from a place of hope and I sincerely hope this is a good movie about mario and luigI  but I can understand the concern people have. either way  I ll at least be watching it.
think the main issue is how the trailer is cut. the audience is used to a more bubbly peach and the trailer made her out to be a bit too serious  especially when she took up the halberd. I do think the final product will be a home run  but this trailer is only sparking the flames of the jaded. nintendo was monitoring this film themselves  I doubt they will allow too much changes to their characters.
I will say I do like how true to princess peach they kept her so far  I felt if it was live action it would look almost completely different especially if it had a modern day twist on it too.
princess peach can act tough  but she has to stay in character. let s not forget she was in super smash bros which makes sense because their up lots of references.
I wouldn t really say so  since peach has been portrayed as capable in the games before  even having her own game at one point
I hope she keeps the role of a princess  taking initiative and responsibility to protect her kingdom even in the mario manga she has this role which is different from the gameI just hope they dont dumb everyone else to do so  you can have great characters without the expense of the other characters
peach has been feisty and capable. definitely a leader its not out of character at all. she cute honestly  I sure the movie will actually be good. I hope daisy in it
the only thing that I am not fond of with peach is the halberd weapon she was holding. yes  she is capable of defending herself but I wouldn t personally imagine her with a halberd. despite that  I think they nailed her!
100  agree with this take  movie looks great  and I think it will be fun watching mario finding his footing also peach seems just fine to me  I just want it to be mario s adventure. I do however also 100  understand the response after the last almost decade of hollywood  strong female  leads which have typically only been able to  establish dominance  at the expense of men  its almost like sexists are working on these projects and not sane well-rounded individuals  sadly hollywood has a lot of work to do in earning a lot of peoples trust back and hopefully this movie will be one of those.
I think you were totally right in saying that people have become so jaded these past few years with female leads that are just so unlikeable changed that even seeing a female character is like a red flag in their heads. and they start to look for things that aren t really there  like with peach. its really unfortunate because I agree thatshe seems cute and feisty  and also nice and affectionate to mario  her male counterpart  instead of putting him down . and peach has been portrayed as capable and feisty before  she s held weapons  she s worn other outfits besides dresses  she s a princess who of course has to run a kingdom  and she s always fed up with being kidnapped. I think the movie will speak for itself. the rest looks fun enough that I think a lot of people will at least give it a chance and hopefully they stick to true characterization of peach.
Im honestly hoping its bad trailer editing  really hoping.thatsaid  I actually did like how peach was handled in mario   rabbids  like she wasn t in the party but overlooking repairs at first while saying she d wanna come with too this time  then later flies down with her umbrella dress and all  looking all dainty and princess like in her dress only to tear ass with a God damn shotgun  xddI think that fit her well  being bad ass while keeping her femininity intact  it was great    w
I thinks peach looks very good in this. I watched the  super mario brothers super show  growing up  and peach  toadstool in that iteration  was always helping the team  not to mention multiple games where peach was playable right along mario  luigI  and toad  the first of which being all the way back on the nes with  super mario bros 2.    Im exited for the movie and I think peach will be great.
to be honest  it looks like a copy-paste of  lego movie  to me.
to me I always saw her as more of a commander type  than being in front lines  like its being shown in the trailer.
sorry homie but mario is gunna be an absolute doofus in this movie.
is luigI gonna go on a tangent about some guy named pepe silvia
thats not how the mario story is supposed to work he s supposed to save peaches thats how the whole story started. now she s smarter and tougher than mario the story really doesnt work anymore.
I hope they do it that way  but my faith in hollywood is in the negatives.
she doesnt seem to treat mario like a dunce.
@sgbruv  he has always been
@david frame well this is a different story than what youre used to  idk what to tell you. sorry that they re doing something different
let s not forget she s help mario before. mario rpg and super paper mario to name a few.
every modern writer mistakes sass for toughness in female characters  which is oddly belittling imo. yes  more  traditionally feminine  and highly classy women can  in fact  still be badasses. so rarely acknowledged in modern media  not to be the old man yelling at a cloud..
they bowed to woke hollywood to get the film done. dont hold your breath.
@doomkid  I think the perfect example of this  was peggy carter. she was always classy and feminine  but could definitely hold her own. I loved that.
I think thats kinda what they re aiming for I dont think they would go woke enough on her if they did you would have miyamoto knocking on the door. hes very firm with his characters.
sooo this movie does not have bowsette
sorry gotta disagree about the voice  maybe thats just my bias towards anya taylor joy but Im fine with peach s voice  it comes down to the writing which admittedly im not 100  sold on just yet  and performance which Im sure joy will do great at
I feel the exact same way.
@chad wolf  woke in mario where did you get such a ludicrous idea we ve had strong female characters for years and no one complained I hate woke in media too but I dont see anything woke about the super mario bros movie trailers people are just looking for something in these trailers to hate we ve seen peach be a strong character before.
@spider-fan006  youre talking through me. peach being a girl boss has never been a feature of a mario game. peach being a playable character has been. but peach has always been classy  not some tropey modern-era girl boss as the trailer depicts.
I better get the luigI death stare or Im  gonna riot
@neo06  its not different its the same basic gender dynamics as so many other movies and tv shows.
@neo06  look up something called  masters of the universe  revelations   chief   !
agreed!
they re allowed to do something different they own the property Im just saying Im not watching it which it  Im allowed to not watch it and Im also allowed to complain. I wish them the best I hope they dont end up like disney.
@neo06 you mean  catering to the modern audiences
@tasty churro  thats a spinoff and she still retain her feminine traits and she s was. never a warrior but a graceful and confident princess. even in smash her moveset fits that graceful trait. her being a damsel in distress is just a no no in the modern  culture . she can still hold her own even in captivity. mario saving peach is literally the core element of the ip. removing that is like removing mj with peter  and we know how that happened.
@fire dust  mario trest himself like luigI 2.0
1000 times this.
@norman readdis  how
how about no
apearently mario will be an indiot and leaked posters saying princess beach can do anything. make me not so confident
@fire dust how what
@fire dust  play the mainline games and find out.
@m. andr   kind of like princess bubblegum to which I am not complaining really.
@ jaits 2022  and its obvious mario is going to get side tracked in his own movie.
itseems like thats whats actually happening tho  atleast after I watched the trailer. she still is yk a princess  cant have her be completely soft when she runs a whole kingdom. but mario is still the hero character  so yh I think its fine. but I think I just jinxed it
@the mighty fiction  bro how lmao  cuz of chris pratt
@david frame  wdym  she saved mario   luigI in a few spin off games. especially in super princess peach on the gameboy.this is the origin of mario. I dont know how having peach being a damsel in distress for the very first time is a must in the movie.luigI starts off being a coward. living behind mario s shadow. so it makes sense he needs to be saved the very first time he enters the world. anyone who played luigI s mansion know how luigI behaves and thinks about his brother. this movie fits that narrative peach eventually will get kidnapped multiple times by bowser. but for now  I rather have peach train mario  than mario being a male mary sue and be good at everything off the bat. peach doesnt need saving in this movie. thats fine. we all know how the story goes. mario keeps saving peach. idk why y all complaining lol
@david frame   smarter and tougher  than mario. lolyou say that as if mario starts off knowing everything lol he s not from that world. ofc peach who s a princess to a whole kingdom will know her land and how to deal with most creatures. so yeah  she is smarter and tougher than mario. until the end of the movie. plus being smart tough isn t something out of character for peach. mario   rabbits is proof.daisy is tough. rosaluma is tough and smart.peach is smart and only tough when it involves her friends or people. it has always been like that. like do u people even play mario games  lmao
sorry we cant have a conversation I gave my opinion what a modern audience is and it was clean just my opinion and youtube deleted it and therefore no reason so Im been censored so conversations over.
@david frame  I think luigI is the one who gets captured in this one.
@the mighty fiction you do know who started this whole thing right
@danderfull tivi  what whole thing nintendo  you mean
@e.king5897  you have a hopelessly out-of-his-depth lead who clownfoots his way around the movie while the boss chick kicks ass all around him and rolls her eyes in his direction... voiced by chris pratt. that doesnt sound like  lego movie  to you
we literally see a few of her interactions with others that doesnt fit the  girl boss  mentality. when we see her talking to the toads  she says   together we are going to stop that monster.  if it were a true girl boss  she would be saying something like   step aside toads I am going to save the day.  and when she is talking to mario she says   there s a huge universe out there... with a lot of galaxies. they are all counting on us.  that doesnt give off girl boss vibes. peach is a confident princess leader  but itseems clear she is aware thatshe cant do this alone. which is completely different to a character like captain marvel who is basically  I can do this on my own because  woman.
@the mighty fiction  u got all that from that trailer  really the special the prophecy there a million movies like the lego movie  even tho the lego movie is based on the matrix btwthis is not one of em lol
@david frame  I dont think going pure to the source material would have been the idea either way.it looks like they mixed elements from the whole franchise into 1 movie.
@e.king5897  Im just telling the vibes Im getting. this movie looks veeeeery familiar.
@the mighty fiction  yh but I feel ur reason has to do more with chris pratt than anything yk
the problem is mario already looks like a comical dunce in this trailer so  thats a real fear. Im getting tired of the  girlboss and idiot male  trope.
@sgbruv maybe at the start  because this is an origin story and he has to train to become the mario we know and love.
exactly!!!
@e.king5897  well  emmett  star Lord and now mario. pratt does seem to be carving out his niche doing the  likeable goofball with competent friends.
@norman readdis  if u hear that  run away lol
@rubioalvin Im avoiding it like the plague like how squenix is stating as such. good luck on them.
@angel santos say that to mario in donkey kong arcade  even is capable of capturing dk in dk jr arcade prior to super mario bros. this mario is gru with illumination style slapstick.
feel exactly the same
@ja432123yeah the moment mario  luigI  and toad are undermined to elevate peach artificially  we re gonna have a problem. because while peach is strong in her own right  her strengths are different and more compliment her companions rather than outshine them.
I think that peach can be a strong woman  bruh every game she just looks up as she s kidnapped doing absolutely nothing about it. I do like that peach is finally actually doing something but thatstatement was just
@m. andr   yeah nothing says commander like always being caught by your enemy
dude she s the leader of the mushroom kingdom during wartime with bowser. she also looks like she s making allies with the kong kingdom as well.
agreed
@lunar fall  yeah  because commanders are almighty beings right any average joe can run a kingdom right there s certainly not any commander on earth who was caught killed by enemies right
@m. andr   stop me when I go wrong but princesses dont run kingdoms. kings  or queens  do  right
this is exactly how I feel. peach can be a  boss   sure  but not in such cliched  lazy  stereotypically feminist ways. rather  she s courageous  decisive  protective  honorable  i.e.  the qualities you d hope to find among royalty.
peach has demonstrated she got many fighting skills in super mario games and her own game super princess peach  I think it has a lot of sense seeing her like that in the movie  she s not overpowered  she is what she is meant to be
@nicolas.  I never said she wasn t capable or thatshe doesnt have a long history of holding her own throughout the games. Im just stating that I like the hyper-feminine voice and ladylike demeanor alongside those traits. bubbles from ppg is another example of what Im talking about.
Im just wondering where youre not seeing original peach in the trailer. she seems fine to me.
@sassy ghost  Im giving my opinion based on every comment in this section  not only yours  sadly the things we would like to see in the movie  each person  its not possible to make it real  cause things you like possibly other people dont  I think the peach that they gave us its great  has nothing to change to me
@malachico0  she was a silly girly girl with high pitched voice in the games  here she is advertised as an action chick from western movies
@turbotrup96  yeah and mario always sounded like an italian  yet I dont see anybody claiming its an anti-italian move or something. peach has had several heroic roles through the series  so this is nothing new. just relax bro  this stuff was picked by miyamoto himself. the japanese dont care for the woke or western sensibilities.
@malachico0  chances are there  would be americans who d find the og  italian portrayal of mario xenophobic because its stereotypical.its not about being heroic or not  its about making her be defined by what hollywood deems as strong.edit  and no - I doubt that miyamoto had so much power over the project. at best they sketched him the idea  but never went in with details.how many shitty game or anime adaptations did we have
@malachico0  let me put it this way  miyamoto thinks that he needs to compromise certain aspects of the movie to cater to the western audiences  as suggested by some american adviser  probably.this is what they ve been doing with japanese games. ask capcom or square enix.
@turbotrup96  but not nintendo. you dont have any evidence that miyamoto is caving to western expectations. all that you ever saw was  wimmin do cool axe twirl  she must be a feminist mary sue  when peach has always been a badass  or more accurately  she has been whatever miyamoto wants her to be at the moment  and the japanese always creating badass female characters that dont suck.another thing I forgot before but am realizing now  chris melandandry is an insanely shrewd businessman. he has perfected the formula for creating the most marketable movies ever without putting too much effort in. Imean  why do you think that every single illumination movie has done well despite only one or two of their catalogue actually being good  it because they know how to make the most cutsey  inoffensive trite ever. that being said  because chris is such a good business man  I bet you he understands the concept of  go woke go broke   so I highly doubt he d want to sacrifice sales for the praise of a couple of loosers who will never watch the movie anyways.
@malachico0  even at her most  badass  peach didn t act like that and her body language was still cutesy and super feminine.if woke wasn t selling  we d not be getting more woke works or advertisement. yet we do.does this mean that over 90  of businesspeople are idiots
I hope so
you know it would be fine but the issue is mario is going to be a bumbling idiot who cant do anything right until the last second of the movie
the problem is that isn t peach. the peach we re seeing in this trailer only looks like the peach from the games. she doesnt sound like her video game counterpart  and  more importantly  she doesnt act like her. its a 2 minute trailer and for all we know her role and behavior could be quite different and more consistent with the games throughout the rest of the movie  but Im having doubts.
he s treated like a dunce through the entire trailer though. this is how female empowerment works in hollywood. you cant just bring women up. you gotta bring men down.
its nintendo so I dont see it being woke.
@david frame  peach has been fighting alongside mario since super mario bros 2
no walrus  you peanut. that ain t happen. we live in a wokeworld.
@sgbruv  no he s not some heroes in the beginning dont start off as smart or strong however the more the movie those the more mario turns bigger and better until he defeats bowser
@angel santos  so instead of mario being a male mary sue  you d prefer peach be a  mary sue
@jennifer hamels  a lot of thats my issue. itseems wrong peach would include herself in those statements.  together we will save the day  or  they re counting on us . itshould be  Im counting on  you  to save the day  mario   and  only you can save the day .  mario isn t accompanied by an army when he rescues peach. he s an  against the odds  type hero who saves the day and the girl. this isn t marvel. he s riding solo  unless youre playing two player in the mainline games that allow it . even when peach is playable she s still typically feminine. I get what youre saying  if she isn t patronising and respects the others around her  the movie will be better for it  but Im still sceptical of her portrayal in general.
@top clips  no she hasn t. she fought alongside him in super mario bros 2 and in a few spin-offs  although not in the tough axe wielding style we see here . but in the rest of the mainline games she s being kidnapped and mario has to rescue her. I think she s been kidnapped and rescued  27 times now.
@delacey lehane  I have played every mario game known to man and she wields a umbrella. the staff is the same shit. she is known to be powerful  magical and to use the world s power ups. stay salty for no fucking reason.
@delacey lehane  you do realize there was a whole game where mario was in another castle.
@the mighty fiction  wait  true
@top clips  you think a giant halberd is the same thing as an umbrella  dont know where youre getting your umbrellas. and Im not salty. I just stated a fact. you seem pretty irritated  though.  yourealise there was a game where mario was in another castle    yeah  what s your point
@delacey lehane  all staff like weapons are used the same. halberd is more deadly but the same physics applies. so you are salty.
@top clips  except a staff is a lightweight stick  that any child could pick up and swing around like peach did after 5 minutes of practice  a halberd is a heavy axe which your average woman would struggle to even wield  let alone spin around like a ninja. again  me having an opinion doesnt make me  salty   but you accusing me of being so and throwing a  fucking  in for emphasis definitely makes you appear so.
@neo06  going something different by doing what hollywood always does
@m. andr   there isn t a commander thats ever been captured 30 times thats peach alone. nice disingenuous argument though
@lunar fall   what is your problem man does the way  I  interpreted the game offended you do youreally want to be that guy that tries so hard to find logic in a video game that is completely unrealistic the fact that it commanders do get kidnapped in real life  can serve as inspiration.do youreally think that in her kingdom there s someone who can stop bowser why dont you go complain to nintendo then  Im not the one who made her story.
@the mighty fiction  and it works well.
yeah from the trailer I think mario s gonna be the bumbling idiot that holds her back. if they are able to make a joke at peach s expense or get them to work together in a way he isn t a nuisance to her then Im good with it
@fire dust you didn t see the  let s a go  scene where he reenacts the side scrolling aspect of the game and he completely gets effed-ah up  peach was there just like  ohmiGod  is he serious
check out how mature and responsable peach in french     vive la france
from what we can see from the trailer  mario and luigI do seem to be portrayed as dunces
@angel santos   true  but de girl lee girl personality seems like its ms sing.  peach is girl lee  but brave win she kneads two. diss movie seems like her personality is flipped. brave preach is her neutral personality while de girl lee girl is secondary. de movie could bee different but that my a some shawn from de trailer.
