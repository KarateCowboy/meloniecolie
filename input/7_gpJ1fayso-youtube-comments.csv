thank God cavil got out of there when he had the chance
melonies reviews are the best. the voices impressions are so much better than the show itself.
your retelling of this episode is legitimately better than the bit of the episode I could sit through.
ps2-graphic beast pet  honestly sounds like the best part of this horrid-sounding show. thank you for suffering through this so that we dont have to.
keep reviewing episodes. this is better than tuning into the show.
the voices  the jumping thru the episode  this was the best synopsis of anything I have ever heard. as a californian in exile  I especially appreciate the ample  like s  littered throughout the video. excellent work melonie  I will be back for more. the best!
if az managed to survive several seasons of bat woman  you can do all of blood origin  melonie. we believe in you!
your narration is top notch  far superior and actually more entertaining than the whole show. one episode and I was done. Ive read all books and played all games multiple times. as a fan I even mostly enjoyed the first season and then... the rest happened. happy new year!
mel s sarcastic ad-libbed voice acting is hilarious
I want the whole episode narrated by melonie in those silly voices
honestly Im actually impressed that mel never fails to recount even the dullest tv series in such a way that its entertaining
I live for melonie pronouncing names  and recapping crap episodes.
omg  this review is hysterical.  great to see you back  melonie.
and so then an archer shoots her sister and she is like  oh  heck!    ddd you are awesome and this retelling was just absolutely entertaining. I wouldn t mind rest of the series in this style.
you should do these  role acting  things for the characters all the time  its hilarious
oh hey melonie. its great to see that youre doing well and that youre back at it. Im excited to watch this video.
Ive been hoping for something as bad as rop for the epic reviews. sounds like netflix has delivered. and your review and the voice over work is awesome for this. freakin hilarious.
I dont want you to be subjected to the rest of the show  but I d love you to narrate the rest of the episodes just like you did here
youre no stranger to doing efap.  nice job.  lauren chen on her mediaholic channel reviewed this.  she follows by having her dad  who is retired from the hollywood industry  add to her reviews.  he said it was like they had to slap something together to fill a time slot.
congrats on 100k subs melonie. I love the commentary .  somebody you  d run in to at walmart . we need more reviews like this. love the ps hoody. great video. you look good melonie. I hope you have a fun day. take care melonie.
rather why he got out in the first place  these people dont give a shit at all
the lies about him are so pitiful at this point. their own petty vindictiveness just speaks to his integrity that much more now.
smart captains live to ride another ship
@robint h-d.e.s  please never forget that it is not their genetics  but their own complacent choices which effect their bodies  regardless of their genetics or their ignorance about biology in general. the ideology is the problem  not their bodies. it is their mind s irrational conclusion that is the problem here  not the way they were born. yes  those who are in authority and have deceived the masses are at fault as well of course  but that does not excuse our own intentional complacency as a people.
@robint h-d.e.s  good captains dont rely only on intellect.
@beregond  thats true. its not the mind fallows the body. its the body fallows the mind. once brian washed effectively. the goblin body. is just an unfortunate by product.
omg yesss
the voices crack me up each time
I imagine this was little girl melonie voicing her dolls.
not that I disagree  but you need to think of a better compliment than  so much better than the show itself   when the show is the bottom of the bottom. melonie is fun  intelligent  forthright and damn cute.
@fabio paolo barbieri  I dont get her criticisms  maybe Im not smart enough to infer her intentions from her tone of voice  I just kinda stumbled into this video and Ive never watched her before and Ive never seen blood origins.like for example  she sounds annoyed and mad that a woman beats up a bunch of guys and I dont get why  its a fantasy show and that lady is clearly like some kind of assassin or figther given the weapon she had hidden in her instrument. why does that make her mad  the criticism seems ridiculous and I cant take her seriously and she never explains why she s so bothered with it. can you explain it to me
yup  the voices impressions are the b-e-s-t  d
@lukasz zylik  I cant imagine what this has to do with anything I said. I just said that  given that this show is terrible  it is not a great compliment to say thatshe is much better than it is.
@fabio paolo barbieri  no cause her criticisms kinda suck and she sounds bored like she s forced to do this.
@lukasz zylik  other watchers dont seem to agree with you.
ikr
@fabio paolo barbieri  thats fine
@lukasz zylik  if I can I ll try to help  but if fabio wants to add his 2 cents as well that would be good. there s a few factors with this issue 1  fantasy movies aren t really  anything goes  worlds...they re period movies tv shows with monsters and magic added. a mortal  elf  human etc  assassin doesnt have superhuman strength  speed  powers. to get an idea of what a woman who could actually beat up one or two regular men would look like  google cris cyborg. she s a female mma champion  with a history of steroid use . 2  if you dont have an actor who looks strong like that  then you need amazing choreography to convince us this is actually possible. some people fans have taken a strong interest in fighting action scenes  movies  tv etc. some people have also trained to fight themselves  doing boxing  martial arts etc. we can see action that looks like it might possibly work  versus action that looks fake. for example  in kenobI a female character lightly tugs on a stormtrooper s helmet and he falls down like he got hit with a sledgehammer...this is not realistic or believable. but scarlet johanson s scenes as black widow were really well choreographed  showing us a character who beats guys using agility and leverage  not unrealistic strength. from what Ive seen of blood origin s fight choreography  its pretty bad  and doesnt show a convincing female fighter in action.3  this kind of  weak-sell   a fairly small woman who somehow beats men  often with what looks like a lot of strength moves  has become a cliche  a new but unbelievable stereotype that we are by now thoroughly sick of. it comes down to an agenda   women can only be strong if they fight and act like men    and the poor understanding from directors of how fighting works. again  look at a good example - trinity in the matrix kicks some guys  asses  but even in a reality-flexible world like the matrix  the fight choreographers were smart enough to show her winning with speed and kicking techniques... not upper body strength. too many shows dont get this  and thats one of the reasons those shows fail  while the choreographers from the matrix went on to produce and direct john wick.
@dewulfe99  ok. so from what I can gather a big part of the issue is thatshe is a woman and that its  unrealistic given the setting and the choreography  the choreography seems fine enough in those clips. at least as realistic enough as john wick killing an entire mafia organization or dudes with a pencil. if john wick was joanna wick is it less realistic  no man in real life can do what arnie  keanu reeves  bruce lee or anyone else does in movies. these guys are literally seconds away from a bomb explosion and get knocked aside which is not how these things work in real life. these are all fantasies. a 9 year old anakin cantake on the empires fleet in space because the writers can literally make the force for anything they want cause its all made up. there are no  rules  to imagination in my opinion. apparently in stsr wars molecules are dense enough in space for sound to carry when they are battling up there but the gravity is still weak like in real life  I get what your saying but the writers make up the rules as they go. Im polish. I live in poland and Ive read the books in the native language and they are great and the tv show sucks. adaptations have sucked since the first mario movie and itstill does. I just dont get why everyone has to view things through a political lens. anita sarkeesian did it  this lady does it. everyone s a political pundit pretending to be a nerd. its just a chick kicking ass. lars croft killed scores of tigers and dudes  ripley was taking out queen aliens  michelle yeoh was taking out people left and right back in the day. its just a chick kicking ass in a show   this concept has been around for ages. there are thousands of schlocky 80 s action b movies with badass sexy ladies karate chopping and machine gunning dudes none stop. this criticism is a new thing people started complaining about over something thats been around forever.
I suspect if she had action figures in front of her she would be using her hands to animate them to the words.
I was about to comment on the  ps2-graphic beast  part - and I couldn t agree more
agreed
no  I think noone should give netflix any more view-numbers. they dont care if its hatewatched pr not  as long as people watch. instead sail the high seas if you need to be a masochist  but dont throw even a bone to netflix.
@neosildrake  I agree 100 .
@neosildrake  you do need to realize that reviews like this will  rightfully  sway people away from the series. absolutely disgusting what netflix and the their writer did to this beautiful show. they simply turned it into a  politically correct  mess.
is this part of the series even reflecting any plot from the books  genuinely curious if this is just something the writers decided to do themselves
@cat funt  the entire series from the s2e2 is basically just a bad fanfiction. this is by far the worst it could get... everything that happened in the lore  in this happened differently or didn t at all. the lore characters and the plot elements weren t depicted like this. I dont mind changes to a story  until it literally changes the characters themselves and tries to fuck with the entire lore. at this point just create your own shit. if its actually any good  people will love it. but creating something own and new is hard. if the people in charge at least cared and treated something they didn t create with respect  it would be win for everybody. sorry for the rant. happy new year!
@f c  thank you for explaining! happy new year!
what do you mean
@thawne  I was too rough and broke her back
she almost died from not drinking enough water.she should watch casual geographic  he always says to drink water.
@blox117
@auto clock  you are him arent you
@thawne  casual geographic  of course not. the guy gets millions of views on his videos  he doesnt need to advertise with sock accounts.
@auto clock  so who are you
@thawne  just some guy who watches yt.
@auto clock  so all this talking and you are just a guy on yt
@thawne  well  yeah. I dont know what you were expecting.
@auto clock  are you hal stewart irl or something
@thawne  I dont know who that is.
@auto clock  type it in google
mel  your narration is top tier  I could imagine minI driver recalling the tale exactly like that.
you should do this exact same thing but with action figures. this was great lol
can you please narrate every story like this
for what its worth melonie  thank you so much for doing what you do  in spite of all the crap youve had to quit up with lately.
Im an amateur writer. I can imagine being hired to write for something like the witcher. not my favorite thing ever  but I have bills to pay.  I actually did really like season 1 of the show though.  however  if I took the job  first thing I would do is sit down and read the stories and watch the games being played. I d also read a good bit of the fan commentary to see what they liked  felt was important  didn t like  etc. only then would I start to write and try to write in a way that would please the fans. thats respect for the fans. if I screwed up anyway  I d be able to say honestly   I thought you would like it because of this and this.  I think the fans would be patient under those circumstances and we could always get better as st  tng did after the first season.
this recap was gold. the enthusiasm. you dont have to torture yourself with these. but if you do I ll watch for your take on it.
bwaahahahahahahah  I love your monologues  they always make me laugh my hecking butt off!  the monologue you were doing for the princess and her protector is what made me die of laughter.  I am you but with the flaws removed  is from tomb raider underworld. lara s doppelganger said that to lara. I hate modern haircuts on elves  it makes them look like humans instead. the beast does look like it came straight from the ps2  lol. this show is a garbage dump on fire! rings of power levels of garbage! continue to review this show to entertain us with your suffering  lol.
why would I watch this  when instead  I can have mel recount the episode in the cutest battle traumatized manner possible. saving me precious moments of my life.I hope you have a good therapist  darlin  because if you keep reviewing this show  youre gonna need  em!that was adorable  though! I think you found a new format.
God-mode hack   I hope you keep plowing through the series for us. this review was very entertaining.
in love with your summary! so awesome. dont care in the least for the show itself but  your review and summary  heckin yeah!
this is the best reading of a modern day work of art Ive seen yet.
I absolutely love hearing your interpretation of their dialogue!
best review ever! I would rather watch your reviews of this show than watch it myself!  keep them coming!
for the love of God review all the episodes. this was hilarious. your voice overs for great.
I like how everything thats complete garbage  you do a reenactment of it. I also like the part where you said elves in this show look like people in the milk isle in walmart.
thank you for suffering through this because I refused to watch it. and now I know it was as bad as I thought. melanie your the best!!!
he doesnt look like an elf at all. he just looks like someone you d run into at walmart.  lolll
these impressions are gold. thank you melody
I really enjoy these episode roasts. they keep me up to date on shows that I d like to know about without actually having to sit thru them.
a whole episode in under 20 min  with only the dialogue that really matters  do more episodes! lol
Im gonna need episode 2 on my desk by monday.
melonie your commentary is spot on. its the best Ive ever heard. I dont want you to torture yourself  but your commentary is pretty funny.
I love all these reviews to all these bad recent shows. please do willow next!
top notch review as usual. have a happy new year! better days ahead everyone
the actress you called out for bad acting in the beginning is minnie driver. she has played lara croft before
do more of these. I wanna know what happens next to the emperor guy and the skI on lady.
the voices overs were hilarious  blood origins abridged  melonie mac version
your impressions and voices are incredible melonieprequels are mostly rubbish  congrats on 100k subs  great channel with a great hostess..
true to her word melonie gives us what she promised yesterday!
I love how she told us this story as if she was reading to 5 year olds
melonie your reenactment of the show was way better than the show itself. now I have never seen a minute of it but have watched several reviews and hands down yours is the best. please keep making the destroyed by woke funny!
I will never watch this show but I will watch every one of your recaps  reviews. that was hilarious.
if you dont willingly accept the challenge of enduring this show for the sake of the public  I will be doomed to experience it first hand. I dont possess the inner fortitude and strength that you have to endure this.
you should reenact more movies and tv shows lol. I d watch your full reenactment of rings of power
absolutely love your take on the show melonie. Ive watched the whole thing now and I can say it really doesnt get any better. by the end of it  I still dont see how it ties in to the witcher. maybe Imissed something somewhere.
I just find it funny that they hired minnie driver to be a kind of misandre-type mystery character for this spin-off  because she has apparently known henry cavill for many years  and speaks quite highly of him.
lenny henry  tells you everything you need to know about any film or series.
the reason he describes his dalliance with the princess that way to the lark is because you d not let your foe know any possible emotional vulnerability. its also an effective way to shield yourself from the emotional effect it may have on you as you think about what doing that did to you and your life. men tend to trivialise important events that were painful as a way to protect themselves. you definitely wouldn t tell someone youre fighting how it felt. that being said  the show s bad  so bad.
this was the best review yetyou dont have to continue as we all know how terrible it is. if this show is worse than she-hulk  which I fought through  then I ll definitely not consider watching it  my father s brother-in-law told me to give it a try as he liked it...
lol. you should do this kind of recap for every show. hilarious
working on it

I did not realize that was her  I need to repent
@melonie mac go boom  she was a pretty good lara  too. I think she did most of the revisioned episodes.
I got you  check back tomorrow barring any last minute breaking news drops!  d
thank you so much!

a couple of my rop videos are reinactments
melisandre
yes it is worse  I watched all of rop and she hulk but this was too awful. at least she hulk wasn t boring
when empowered female protagonist killed the badguy with his own lightsaber then looked straight into the camera and said   I am the captain now!  I clapped and cried at the same time.
I just started playing the witcher 3 a few days ago!! I freaking love itso far!! its a shame that the witcher name is being dragged through the mud like this.sounds like God of war is next to get this treatment.
you had me at   you cant control your weiner  lmao I laught so hard I had to pause the video lol.
I watched it on Christmas day  it really felt like I was watching rings of power and lost interest very quickly.
the pain. the absolute pain.
those voice overs were perfect lmao..   I know what the traps are  I seen t it  lol
it cant be worse than rings of power right  blood origins... hold my beer.
that was the best and most entertaining episode synopsis and review I have ever seen! the  my sister got shot! oh heck!  just broke me! I have no interest in this sweatshop bootleg splicing of the worst episodes of  game of thrones  and the entirety of  rings of power   but I would watch all of your reviews! if you even make audio only synopses like this  I would listen to every single one!
love the interdimensional cable like recaps of these terrible shows!
congratulations on 100k its well deserved. you have been on of my absolute favorite yputubers since I found you through the quartering. now its time for road to 200k
I d like to see more of your narration. doesnt matter if its this show or not.
melonie I love this review omg the imagination she puts in
I dont know if its worse but its definitely fighting hard for thatspot.
please do a recap for every episodeedit  please do recaps for every bad show. had my girlfriend watch this. we couldn t stop laughing
we re a gonna tell a story thatsapkowskI wouldn t write ! Ive heard that before!
oh please do some more commentaries like this.  I just love your impressions.
your review was more entertaining than actually watching it!
my favorite part of this show was when I turned off the tv  cancelled my netflix subscription then  picked up the books.
thanks for watching this tripe for us so we dont have to. love the play by play naration haha. cheers
I lost it at God mode hack. I laughed so hard. I love your videos. thank you for being you
thank you
its sad how Im more excited to hear a step by step explanation from melonie instead of watching the actual show. God this show hurt so bad to watch. makes me wonder if thats actually what s going on behind the scenes. all these writers all gathered seeing who can make the most cringe material.
I like how you impersonate the characters from the show  you are very funny  thanks for the review!
hey melonie I just wanted to tell you that congrats to you on your 100k subs. keep it up   I am so happy for you. anyway I just wanted to tell you that I have not heard bout this new show yet and I think that it will be a great show to watch and so I will check it out myself to see how it is and I will let you know what my thoughts bout this new television show series after I watch it  ok melonie. anyway I just wanted to tell you that and I just wanted to tell you that congrats to you on your 100k subs on your youtube channel. anyway I hope you have had a great day today at gym and at home and I hope you continuing to have a great blessed evening at home and have a good night too melonie.
melanie! you are a great streamer  dont suffer for our curiosity lol
1 40-1 57  first things that pop into my head as references there are vision being the improved version of ultron and the julian smith  Im all y all in an hour!  video. I was not ready for that flowers bit.
choosing which is worse between rangz of power and the witcher s b.o. is like choosing your method of execution
I would not wish this headache on anyone.  thanks for the update though.  I enjoy your commentary.
brilliant summary!  praying you can do a review collab with jenny nicholson and or kimI sparkle.
love that beneath the ashes reference!
melonie s narrations hahaha  gold.
spectacular!  but itsounds like a great series to avoid.
well  you cant blame a bard for having unusually strong ties to their instrument  they need their spell casting focus just like every other spell caster.
God this was hilarious
Im lacking words for this show... Im a polish person  not that it means much  but watching one of our greatest cultural exports get butchered over and over again kinda hurts my soul.no matter how used I got to watching terrible media  seeing the witcher get disrespected will always bother me.
5 47 I just cant with the elf of wall street
the show may be dung  but at least we got this out of it. too funny. only way it could be better is if you had action figures to act out the narration.  looking forward to more like this  if you can stomach the show.
thank God for anime  as in by japanese writers and by japanese studios.
your review of bad series makes it pretty funny
17 00  thatstill is hilarious.  I  too  am terrified of a sheathed sword 6 inches away from my chin when I have all the room to step back.
how did they know about the alias  dont think too hard  the writers didn t. almost as good as my favorite braindead explanation of all time   palpatine survived somehow!
baaaah
now I want a funny narration option for all bad shows. Imean just imagine.  background music cues as you start imagining.     gasp  dear this show is so unwatchable. I want to go watch that waffle house chick catch that chair again.  sigh  um  babe have you tried watching it with the funny narration on.  oh  dear you are so right this show is the best ever now  what would I ever do without you.   seriously though thanks melonie that was entertaining. have a safe  and happy new year everyone. have fun  and may this next year bring you a year full of wonderful surprises.
melonie pulled a philadelphia and explained this show to us like we re 6 year olds and I still have no idea what the f ck is going on with it
it cant be as bad
keep reviewing. this trainwreck is hilarious.
seemed like every dept involved in this production was trying to be the worst. one and done for me. great voiceover lol
its like watching the episode but waaay better with melanie s voices
alright  dad. just go ahead and kill me  then  I guess.  no man  Im j-jus  gonna do worse than that...Im gonna banish you and you ll die a nobody.  oh! okay  dad! sure! loved this sum up.
4 20 for melonie s  princess  voice which is pure gold.
Im glad I dont have netflix anymore. this cliff notes commentary is a preferred version anyways
congrats on 100k you deserve it!!
was anyone else bothered by the fact thatsomeone from a medieval time period had a ferrocerium rod to light the fire
glad to see youre safe and doing well
give my points for the reference to doppel.... dark lara in tr underworld thats a good one hahahahah
if you d just told me that it was starring dandelion   I dont care what they call him in the series.  his name is dandelion.  fight me.  Imay have been interested.  I think that actor did a good job.  I know there have been other witchers before geralt  but really  who cares   though maybe I d watch something like lethos played by bautista.
best youtube video idea  can you please do more shows.
isn t it funny how the discussions  reviews about this series are probably more engaging and entertaining than the show itself  it goes to show what the state of modern media has turned into. all in all  I feel sorry for witcher fans. this must be painful.
I love your voiceovers. I ll only be watching your reviews on this show
...somebody you d run into at walmart  at the milk aisle  I dont know...  brutal!
lol the way u explain what s happening is so funny
would like more reviews of this train wreck.
your cliffs notes version is actually objectively better than  the witcher   blood origin .  there is a scene in the series where some characters are walking through a portal and I thought it was the images of a 2004 rpg for console.
happy holidays to melonie and everyone and may you have a great new years.
Ive watched a few of your videos so far  so fairly new. but I love your energy
your monotone retelling of this episode is hilarious. I didn t bother watching any of these crappy shows but I enjoyed this.
melonie mac go story mode. great narration.
you seem real and genuine. unlike those woke demons that Im trying to run away from. there  you ve earned a subscriber
thanks for suffering for us. you can see why cavill had to bail  he was fighting against a show like this.
thank you for watching this for me
4 22 reminds me of dark helmet playing with his action figures!!! too funny!
congratulations on 100k subscribers btw. of course you were able to slide in a tomb raider reference
do it!just.. do it!!best review so far  dIm just sorry that youre subjected to this total pos!
welcome back melonie.  congratulations on 100k.  go boom.
ok..love the voices during the reenactment...would have been chef s kiss if you had some action figures as well to demonstrate.
please continue.  you make me laugh so much reviewing thatshite.
I could barely understand anything melonie was explaining  very entertaining though
I will watch this entire first season if mel s narration dubs over everything. thats my condition netflix take it or leave it.  insert black panther meme  give this woman a paycheck
the way you summarize this sh!tty show is hilarious
glad your feeling better I know you were ill recently.
watching melonie watch the wbo is better than watching wbo.
what I learned from this series is that minnie driver isn t a golf term.
doesnt this show have pretty gratuitous nudity throughout  if so  props to you for scanning through it without fear  especially considering how that lara croft  statue  video went.I guess what Im getting out of this show is that they really nailed how loathsome and despicable elves are in the witcher setting  though I ll grant not on purpose. also  I dont know if this a result of wokesters being in charge of writing shows  or if its a result of incompetent morons being in charge of writing shows  but Im so tired of all the characters in a show just being angry dicks to each other every time they open their mouths. I dont know if they do that to try and establish conflict before they come to like each other  but cant actually pull off thatsecond part  or if its just that the writers think thats clever dialog or whatever else  but Ive had about enough of it. maybe thats just me being weird though  because I was the one that had no problem being the most evil thing in the galaxy in kotor  but I was always nice to my party members.
was waiting for your feedback on this
the reviews of the show are better than the show itself ha ha
please review more!!!
God bless you melonie for suffering through this dreck so I dont have to.
best review ever more more like this.. do resident  evil by netflix next please
this is getting scary for the fans.a few months ago  the worst thing on stream right now was she-hulk.then the worst thing was rop on amazon.now the worst thing is w  bo on netflix.what will it take to get the people at the top of these giant entertainment corporations to pull their heads out
your narration is more compelling  than their writing.
ah  c mon...is it that bad  hahaha I believe you. thank the maker that Ive not even watched a a frame of rings of power since I dont have amazon prime. I even love the jack reacher movies and dont have it yet for thatseries. so the guy effed the princess   Im gonna watch it now but I know to not expect anything good but I loved he witcher show with cavill
hI  yourecognized that the mage is the same guy who played the leader of the harfoots in rings of power  like an indicator for quality shows!
you know how when little kids have dolls and they do the voices for them both while playing with them.  thats what this video feels like.  unfortunately  she is not making up the 8 year old dialog.
is anyone else getting a michael pe a  luis in ant-man  vibe from melonie as she describes the episode
that elf with the modern haircut looks like he should be in a rogaine commercial.  the elf ears look just awful. every time in a well litscene you are just taken out of it. unlike the show  this review was fantastic!
subbed. great job
lol melonies fans just wanted to make her feel the pain asking her to review this one  the final episode is actually very hilarious if you dont take anything srsly  but I dont know man... the final episode is so unintentionally hilarious funny in all that happens its the only reason I think she should watch more  but she d have to suffer through episode 2   3 to get there
I suffered the first episode until I gave up after that  fight 15 00   it was to much. I never seen a show that got me so frustrated.
need more reviews haha
thank you to you and drinker for watching this so I dont have to  rip the witcher ip
makes   she-hulk   look ... ... dare I say ... ... a competent go at it thats messed up hope youre all good and whatnot 2023 about to either get more hilarious
in every review or story summary of this show that dude is always just referred to as  dog clan guy
the princess s bed chamber looks like she shopped at ikea and pottery barn. hallway walls have apparently electric like sconces. only things missing his her flat screen tv  xbox  and maybe a gaming pc.
the funny thing is  that lady in the beginning was the best actress in the show. her name is minnie driver.
the other thing that annoyed me was the way that the lark holds the bow of the instrument  which isn t how you hold a bow. like maybe she just liked holding the bow badly in her fist  as a style choice  I cant decide if she or the director both had no idea  or if they knew but thought it was an artistic choice  in which case someone should have slapped both of them. later  when the little girl plays the instrument for 1 second  the little girl holds the bow correctly lol  which makes the lark look like a brute and stupid fool. so someone knew how to hold a bow of an instrument  but no one thought that the lark  who was supposed to be this skilled musician  should know how to hold a bow. sorry for all the rants  this show is just so stupid  it may seem like small details  but all of those small details add up to make a truly awful show. and instruments with bows such as violins and cellos are the worst offenders for always being so badly faked in television shows  from the finger positions to the movement of the bow  that its kind of a sore point for myself and others who are musicians  and die every time we see hollywood try to fake it instead of hiring real musicians.
hI son.  you couldn t even control your wiener
congrats with 100k and happy new year!
I love how they already have content and source material and still write so terrible
why is her commentary always better than the show.
tomb raider reference about the flaws  subtle but clever
@1 37 I like how you snuck in a tomb raider reference lol
netflix always having to hit all woke check mark boxes. her impressions of the show are way better than the show itself lmao
that was a sinking ship and geralt of rivia jumped out of it
excellent review
man  if it weren t for house of the dragon and top gun  I think this year might have been a total wash.
best comedy of 2022
I think its better than rop. I was actually able to finish this one. I think thats because its a lot shorter. also  even as bad as the characters are in twbo.. no one holds a candle to galadrial. that character single handly kept me from finishing rop...
cant be bothered to watch the show.  life is precious and I ain t wasting sleep or time over this.
happy new year melonie!
no way anything can be worse than rings of power
even my wife who has no real pickiness for fantasy saw this show and said its trash lol
watching this on 1.5x speed  epic.
yessss! I was waiting for someone to get it
@melonie mac go boom   of course!! lara and doppelganger   in the tomb raider underworld beneath the ashes dlc  who could forget
cap
simply amazing
more pls!
that may have been the single greatest dramatic professional reading of the netflix script writing teams portrayal of canonically accurate dialogue that has ever or will ever  exist. thank you melonie. I literally only want more of that from now on  p
enjoyable review
missing lenny henry as a black sarumon  I dont think Imissed much.
Im not a fan of the witcher series Ive played 2 and 3 but I couldn t get through 30 mins of this. God must truly be with you to survive this to me it just feels off I think the drinker described all its problems in this series perfectly
you should do a review in a  a bad lip reading  style.
are you going to the new years eve thing they have in dallas  I will probably go  I am mainly going up there to hang out with friends and catch the tcu game.
lol!  doin the nasty  haha!!! priceless
lul and I thought rings of power was atrocious. this is inspiring to me because Im trying to get into writing myself and whenever I see this Im just like... who has the audacity to pay these writers  this is ridiculous. henry cavil dodged a bullet when he left. now I know what not to do.
you gotta have the brain power to watch the show. you see with me Ive watched a lot of horrible tv shows like rings of power  obI wan kenboI  she hulk  star wars the last jedI  broke me  and the more you keep watching them  the more numb you become when you watch a movie or tv show. to be honest I just fricking skipped it. thank you for reviewing the travesty that is.
lol @  hey  son  you couldn t even control your weiner.
I dont actually know a lot about the witcher mythology  I know its a game series and I guess its based on a book series before that but other than that Im a little clueless.  I guess I ll have to research itsometimes  the video was funny despite my knowing practically nothing about the source material!!!
great video
Ive gotten so much entertainment this year watching people like you rip these shows apart. I never watched this or any of the other garbage like she hulk  rings of power  etc. the reviews are so much more entertaining than putting myself through actually watching this garbage.
they should have stuck with the inverted cinematography the entire episode.
hey melonie! love the ps hoodie
the only show that can carry a scene full of fs is the wire
Im surprised you watched and sat through it!
hey son  you couldn t even control your weiner.  lol. very entertaining review!
the games are non-canon sequels to the books technically.
@chandler burse   that makes sense  thanks  I ll have to do more research on it.
Im glad I didn t watched the show  wasting 4 hours of my time  and got the run down here  way more fun and entertaining.
Im so glad I didn t waste time watching this show. boom s recap was far more entertaining.
you couldnt even control your wiener
there was a witcher before geralt!!!1! that... would be required  as he s one of the last few confirmed witchers alive in the books and games...good Lord  the writers didn t research anything  did they
lmfao  looks like a guy you d run into at walmart
you keep having new and nice hair styles!
lmao. melonie s voice-over of the dialog is like thie mr bill show. I haven t watched the trash  but her dialog is probably better.
how come only the princess and her brother have scottish accents   that was weird.
I will start by saying  I have not read the books  I have played all 3 main entry witcher games  the throne breaker spin off  and gwent. I have seen the netflix show  and the animate spin off. I am by no means a lore buff. I will also acknowledge this minI series is the worst of all aforementioned entertainment mediums and it definitely attempted to blackout bingo the diversity rep woke agenda. however  I still enjoyed my time with it. I really like the main cast  my fav being the dwarf  I thought the acting was very good and most the dialogue was fine. it had pacing issues due to the 4 ep limit and cgI was spotty  but overall  it was serviceable  even if itstrayed away from the source material. its not something I would recommend to people as it was generic fantasy  but I did not feel I wasted my time  and very much enjoyed it.
I just watched the show   update  I will be checking in to a mental hospital monday morning . dont watch it dont become me
all this needs is stick figure comic drawings in place of the show stills and this review would be perfect.
this is what happens when people who stop intellectually and emotionally maturing in middle-school grow up and get jobs writing fantasy tv series.  they surround themselves inside a bubble with others just like themselves and think thats the real world.
what kind of people does mel run into in the milk isle at walmart
I personally dont think its worse then rop  because I had no hope for blood origin to begin with. blood origin had a lower budget. its not as long as rop. dont get me wrong  its pretty freaking bad xd guess my opinion is  that I still had something of an expectation for rop  where I had none for blood origin from the very first trailer about it  so it hurt far more with rop
only the best of hollywoods 2022 writers.
and so it is  that the curse of lenny henry continues.I wonder if michelle yeoh has seen lenny s extremely derogatory impersonation of asian people
what I found hilarious is that both in-universe and in our real world the story is being told by a woman  or what appears to be a woman because what is a woman today   and in hindsight it tracks that it is a bad storytelling and in-universe they ask a good storyteller  jaskier  who is a man for help to spread the story in the better way but refuse to do that in our real world blaming men for everything that doesnt go their way xd
the worse part to me its that the series doesnt have that ambient from the series  it doesnt feel like we are there  just a bunch of random scenarios and decorations but all of them look cheap.
...why would they archer the sister  but not the other sister   arrows aren t that expensive.  you dont engage hand2hand just because the soon-to-be-corpse insults you.
bo is just rop without the budget not subjecting myself to that again
gotta admit I watched this fully through  left a like and now a comment. however I was drunk the entire time and absorbed no information other that the sheer disappointment that oozed from your voice over this episode.
you probably did a better job at acting it out than the actual show did. with how netflix did the witcher  I stopped watching after season 1 and with seeing this it makes me not want to watch it either.
the witcher blood origin execs  ok  but what does this have to do with the witcher  writers  the witcher .
the world economic forum is going to mandate forced viewings of the witcher  blood origin soon...
the story is awesome  and the plot is great. just think about it for a minute.the princess and mage and commander dont want peace  they think peace will not work... so to stop the peace treaty  that wants to bring the 3 realms together  and stop the fighting and killing of each other.they go behind their backs  unite all the people that want to be at war  to kill the ones that want to make peace. so that they canthen rule the kingdom together as one united kingdom.think about that... they killed all the peace seeking people  because they didn t want to stop fighting each other.... that was why they united to kill them all... but in uniting together  they ended up as one kingdom  which meant that they would no longer be fighting each other  and would no longer be at war.so they did the exact thing  that they were supposed to be stopping from happening.if they hated the idea of peace  so much that they would kill their own leaders and people... why are they now no longer fighting each other.... and not only not fighting  but are happy to now be one united kingdom  that is no longer at war.what kind of sense does that make if their end goal was to be one united kingdom  why not let the peace treaties go ahead  why betray your own people  just to end up doing the exact same thing that they were planning on doing themselves
this is the problem with movies and tv adaptions of game franchisees  they dont take itserious and cut corners with casting a budgets. somehow  marvel made it work with the start of the mcu but games seem to not be able to get out of the rut of poor quality movies and tv series. I think if they stayed true to the sources material instead of creating their own thing  we could see some good film and tv adaptions and spinoffs. and  if they stopped with trying to wedge in representation.I d enjoy a deus ex and horizon zero dawn film or tv series if they took itserious and tried to stay true to the characters and lore. but  they d likely mess that up too. I think the only thing we got that was close to good was the lara croft   tomb raider movie with angelina jolie.
lol waterboarding torture levels. thatsounds about right.
9 27 holy crap its nacho libre
Im 37 and Ive not seen lenny henry since I was a child teen. he s managed to try and make his comeback on 2 of the worst streaming programs of 2022 lol. saying that he was only a local comedian to begin with.
we tried drinking game  shot for every time they said clanwe stopped after half hour  it was too dangerous
the thing that bothers me the most about everything Ive seen about this show is that there is no common aesthetic with any individual person within their own culture. no one has the same type of hairstyle clothing  markings weapons architecture aside from the obvious diversity of skin color in the show and it doesnt feel like anything belongs in the same universe. it doesnt make a lick of sense artistically.
yours  heel vs babyface and disparu s reviews are the only good thing about this show being released.
love the scion lady. its pronounced ssssssI on. lol.
Ive got zero background on this.   but  I have a couple of the first two books coming from an interlibrary loan to read before I buy them.  sounds like I need to skip the later series of these shows.
so this is for the ad membership plan for netflix it looks like it
I really want to know where the scandinavian looking people are at  if this is supposed to be set in the witcher series purview. I am not the biggest fan but I like fantasy  and I like it to fit the lore it is supposedly trying to adapt. there is so much wrong with this series I could not get past the first 2 episodes.
I watched the first whole season of witcher n loved it but the first ep of season 2 didn t finish it bc it didn t feel the same way the first season ep 1 did.glad my sense of judgement helped me not see the garbage they produced. show out to the heroes thatstill hoped that there might be still something good about it.
lol I love this.
remember when something was so bad  you could only laugh  I no longer laugh at these things. this because instead of it being the rare nauseating exception to the norm  awful shows like this now are the norm. its impossible to find delight in dreadfulness when that is all that there is.
so glad that others are watching this so I dont have to waste the time money.
I haven t even seen it. much rather watch melonies reviews on it. its more entertaining
move on to something you actually enjoy  - these projects aren t even worth the hate-watching
the netflix business model is quantity over quality. most of the content is dumbed down to suit the casual viewer because thats the majority of their subscribers.
well Imean it did get a audience score of an 8-10 . lmao
maybe some of the executives at netflix and amazon have a bet to see who can put out the worst crappy  woke content
15 00 that is a modern man in a tank top my goodness what happened to being fantasy
no one to latch on to. compared to the original witcher series  there were some character easily latched onto like that bard thatsung that catchy song.
Ive heard netflix are going to do a series of dark souls adaptations  plus bloodborne and elden ring... hahaha  only joking everyone!  put the pitchforks away  now!
this narration is same tone I voice dolls or little people with my nieces and my daughter when she was young.  lol.
Imade it halfway through the episode... ugh.the first season of the witcher I binged in 2 days. not so for this one series.
I am so sorry you had to go through that. my thoughts and prayers go to you and your family. please note  I copied pasted this comment from a video of a horrifying train wreck. I figured  same difference.
the stereotyping of the irish was astonishing and yet no one said a word about it.
I saw an ad for the show and saw the very diverse cast. then I saw the witcher logo. what a shame.
didn t think it was possible its worse than I thought
three kingdoms divers from one another no three divers kingdoms that are exactly the same.
we like you too much. dont subject yourself to such punishment.
multiculturalism  when china  russia  congo  brazil  canada  finland  and italy are indistinguishable. same people  same architecture  same food  same everything. when there is no longer a reason to travel. because everything looks like what s currently around you.
I wouldn t have asked you that.  it would be cruel and unusual punishment if prisoners were forced to watch it.  the irony is this is 14th century-polish based mythology created by sapkowski.  there s not a polish actor in it.  it looks like east hollywood.
youre right its not as bad as rings of power. its way worse. the talking like they can barely read and are reading from a prompter.
this would have been better if you used a mis-match of he-man  gI joe  transformers and star wars action figures to act out the review.
I ran into that guy in the walmart milk aisle.
thats the best thing to do of course  when you ruin something good  try again with less effort than before.
great review  but I d still argue rop is worse for the simple reason that it went out of its way to plunder and misrepresent the work of an author who isn t alive to protest.
Im enjoying this much more than the actually show! much higher quality entertainment! this show is an insult to fantasy stories and has nothing to do with the witcher lore or world. imagine if henry was still with this show and trying to advocate for it being a witcher show. it would ruin his career! I could totally understand if you decide not to continue watching the rest cause from what Ive seen heard it only gets worse after episode 1!
man  michelle yeoh deserved better. just...yeah.
so the netflix witcher writers basically tried to cancel the original origin stories through their disaster  blood origin  and Im guessing they hope its good enough to attract viewers who know nothing of the witcher. wow! so adapting a story for them is pretty much stamping it out and replacing it with their own material while using the popular name the witcher and pretending thats what they are making. what a scam!
hImelonie I hope 2023bring you more  happienesshopefully sooner than later foru to get behind your stalkertakecare melonie
Im not a fan of how clean modern films and shows are. the picture quality just doesnt look right since Ive grown up with vhs tapes and low resolution tube-tvs. Im zure thatsounds very strange to a young kid who grew up with high resolution everything.
looks like they removed a bunch of your subscribers again.  I was one of them.  thankfully  I found you again.  loved the review!  I agree  this show is just as bad as rings of power and wheel of time.  I feel like they got all the cw people and the worst of the sci-fI channel woke idiots and hired them all.
b e s t   r e v I e w   e v e r
how I ruined my career in just two series  a lenny henry special. yer a harfoot wizard  lenny! Im glad that they didn t appropriate the culture of poland here and got actual polish actors for the show  because cultural appropriation is bad  m kay Imean  the memes are better than the show is  and I hope everyone in the show appreciates these paychecks as they re possibly the last ones they might get for being an adult pretender.  save your psyche mel  and watch actual good stuff too so that this twisted mind poison isn t all you watch.
melonie  ok hes back at the alternate wakanda dimensionme  haha thats...wait! did the really copy black panth...his clothes black and gold with a unique tribal looking design....omg they copied that.... im done.
honestly... Im not even sure I want to take a peek at this point.there is such a fine line with live action fantasy series and movies between good and totally cringe  that I suppose I dont need to guess what this is gonna be... in the end its gonna be worse than cowboy bebop... good ideas  not to shabby screen play and production design  but an absolutely catastrophic writing  cringe everywhere  messing with the story of the original  bad choreography... nah...
I didn t think this was too bad but yea the acting left alot to be desired and dandelion though that character is kind of a bumbling idiot bard
someone was watching an episode or to of rick and morty s interdimensional cable before they reviewed blood origins.
episodes 2 through 4 were even worse. reviews have been more entertaining than the show lol.
netflix shat the bed with the witcher.  but did excellent with arcane.
I watched blood origin and liked it.  Im sure I lack the mental acumen to deconstruct this as I watch it  but I found it entertaining and not preachy.  everyone should judge for themselves.  or you could just follow the mob with your blinders on which is exactly how we got white house steward  joe biden.
I didn t think blood origin wasn t that bad  but is was a bit of a mess  they didn t develop the characters properly  the witcher transformation and mutation was crap. they cut it from 6 to 4 episodes  which I dont think helped. have you seen the willow series  it is 10 time worse than blood origin  with incredibly bad writing and choices with character voices  the worsest Ive seen was trolls with cultured voices  it wasn t funny.
congratulations on 100k
upside down camera for no reason. lol. someone thought it was  artistic  but it had no point to it and no artistic merit to it. it wasn t a reflection  it wasn t someone hanging upside down who was right way up and then flipped  it was just someone clueless who thought  yeah let s do an upside down camera for no reason  that will be cool.  the action didn t benefit from looking cool upside down. it wasn t from anyone s point of view who was upside down. you have to make artistic choices for reasons  and there was no reason here. it was just completely pretentious with zero skill or thought in the cinematography. it drew attention to the fact that this was an artificial thing where some idiot was making stupid camera decisions  rather than drawing you into the story. and of course everything goes downhill from there  with the ridiculous narrative frame and  well  every single thing about the show.
9.08 - er  what an icelandic viking village is doing in a movie about empire of elves    d
okay  you make the insane decision to cast your lead in a fantasy show about medieval poland as a black woman. not good  but okay. this character is supposed to be a musician  singer and a capable fighter. of all the black female actresses out there right now looking for work  they couldn t find one who could play an instrument  be willing to learn  could sing  we see bjw in the first few moments playing  I dont think anyone believes she s playing. hear her singing  which we all believe because its that bad. dont believe she could be some sort of inspiration to anyone. also  can handle herself in a fight so those sequences  of which they ll be many  look more believable. not to mention  wouldn t hurt if she could act and or be attractive.
so what Im hearing is that its exactly like rings of power. the woman are all super strong and super powerful and are always right for no reason at all and all of the men  particularly white men  are either stupid  weak or evil. Im not even going to get into the race swapping because this is supposed to be a  new  ip so none of the characters from the original witcher exist  except for dandelion which they changed his name to yaskir  sp   for no reason at all . yeah I will not be watching this at all. I will say congratulations to modern day movies and television for encouraging people to read books instead of watching the crappy tv movie versions instead.
at 8 10 I couldn t agree more. I would never talk about a girl like she s a piece of meat.
I cant be the only one that loved rings of power. what the flip is with all the hate. it was great imo. my gf also loved it. strange
girl would literally rather eat a stick of butter instead of watching this show.
you dont have to keep doing this. if youreally want to do something cool  stream yourself playing the 2007 witcher game. seriously.
its definitely as bad as the rings of power. the action is the only thing it does better than the ring of power and not by much
so this is the cyberpunk 2077 season
elves were suppose to look outer earthly beautiful  refined tall and pale. what we see here are humans with prosthetic ears and the diversity isn t helping at all.
what netflix did with the show should be a crime. they didn t just murder the character of geralt   the lore  they pissed all over its corpse. and they wonder why fans are mad  wtf !
no I d give up  episode 2 is way worse. I dont care about the woke stuff identity politics all thatstuff as long as we still get a good story that fits the lore. this is so generic it could be any fantasy show  it is boring  wastes time on things that aren t important. there is only 4 episodes and after two only one thing has really happened and we are nowhere closer to blood origin itself and the story is almost unrecognisable from the game  sorry not read the books. it makes rings of power look like a masterpiece. can.t believe there has been 3 big budget fantasy shows this year that are worse than cw s the outpost. I want it back ahead of any of those shows.
elf prince got the louder with crowder hair cut
sounded painful
as someone who still has a ps2 I take offense to that lol
episode 1 was okay
lol. that black mage was a harfoot in rop.....hope u found out....
the elves look like vulcans lol
happy new year melanie
welcome back!
melonie you are stunning and brave  not like those fakes on twitter.
well masochistic enjoy pain so...
ahaha oh no my sister is no longer with us at this time
the glitcher woke origin
def move on  I think we get how bad it is
its important to stay hydrated.
minnie driver was clearly phoning in her performance.
fantasy races with modern hair cuts... discount cosplays from wish
everyone says its so bad I get curious to see what its about.
wokeflix does it again.
awesome
............
effity eff eff!
wait up! lenny henry ! !  nah  he can do better than the witcher!!!
happy new year from knoxville!
love the commentary  especially with the silly voices  super funny  d but dont keep doing them if you dont want to - I couldn t watch this garbage if my life depended on it  p
I cant wait until streaming services run out of money for original programming. most of it has been so atrocious.
its not the same without henry cavil
dont worry  the show gets far worse by the end
make it a watch party to force those who asked reviewing such thing to have a share of fun.
hold the fudge on - michelle yeoh s in this  um. . . .  to quote kenan rockmore  . . . . .whyyy! !
watched a few reviews. your review is the best. so funny. you talk slow and stutter exactly like the actors. in know your doing it deliberately.

love these reviews of the woke nonsense in these shows especially with the cringy dialogue!
well  you could always watch gutsy instead.
pro-tip   watch this video at 2x speed for good times
hey melonie  nice outfit and yes we only care about cavills witcher nothing else.
I thought they were vulcans
long live the dog clan
I d rather hang out with your stalker for four hours than watch that crap
this makes me so angry  saenchaI is the greatest fighter to ever live  not some elf played by that lady
good vid siski
team up with az!!
3 55 on top of that  now that Im thinking with all this trend of women overpowering men in eeevvry series now a days... she could be bent by a summer breeze... if at least her arms were somewhat buiilt up  but... not even.
thank God I canceled my netflix
the guy lost to an asian lady twice his age.
if bad larpers made a tv show
I have no idea what are you talking about    waterboarding  is such a fun name for such a excruciating method of torture... like surf boarding. although it also sounds like ironing board  another board used for torture...
ya know what  maybe these shows would actually get canceled if ya ll didn t hate watch them so much. ever heard the saying  no publicity is bad publicity   we re both two sides of a coin. if we d just ignore shows like this  instead of hate watch them and make videos about them  maybe we d see less of them.
after watching episode one I decided that taking a dump was more interesting.
my life is incredibly boring! however! it would make a better story than all this nonsense of late!
just watch the other episodes to but no review please. it is a nice show I think  and watch please be nice to your future husband  that guy Imean.
you dont have to say  then  before every sentence. we understand that your next description follows chronologically.
say what you will  the ps2 was capable of some great graphics.
I get no bonus points.
indeed  it does seem unbearable  by the looks of it. I wouldn t see it and there are other streamers who are reviewing it  so that we dont have to. so  if you can not even get a laugh out of it  why carry on with it
oI  I thought you were supposed to be recovering from all the recent life events. this show isn t gonna help that.
damn she cute
spoiler alerts are not reviews.
the costume look like weak cosplay outfits!
...o...m...g...
love you
cant wait for henry s warhammer show to wreck the witcher
commenting to feed the algorithm
2 09 minnie driver. whoops.  I haven t watched the original witcher show on netflix. so I ll pass.
be sure to drink your water please
oh fuck... thank God I canceled netflix awhile back
Im thankful for the books and the games cause this is so disappointing
did they seriously put the black girl in  raven clan  and made the setting for the  dog clan  in the middle east people are so hypersensitive over racism in hollywood  and they didn t catch that !
im pretty sure I like your story over this one!holy crap I cant believe you watched that ! Im sorry! I will never watch it! I dont know how you got through all of that! eew!!!
the 2nd season on the witcher lost me I didnt like it at all....I just saw the thumbnail of the  origin  thing and it was a big nope for me..   thanks for the review.....its more entertaining then witcher season 2 and this show Im assuming lolwhat does it have to do with the witcher  made up b4 story  cuz I really dont c the connection
toss a coin to your witcher...unless its cringy and preachytoss a coin to your witcher...but no more andrej sapkowskitoss a coin to your witcher...welcome to our alternate reality...
those sadistics bastards who make you watch that arent your friends
hahahahahaha
couldn t get past first 15m of episode 1.
6 27 this ni....mage type guy
hahaha geralts not gonna like it haha it means cavill or fans haha so funny.where is my toaster  I need to hop to a bath
as much as I enjoyed your review  I think you have endured enough lately.  I dont want to see you suffer anymore.
melonie just watch avatar 2 at least it has characters you care about and is more creative than witcher blood origin
what does this show have to do with the witcher
glad Imissed that cringe.
yeah  you pretty much nailed it  lol this show is such a joke.. sadge
yes all xd xd
u need better options than waterboarding
we need to take a stand against this crap story writing!
we  will go forth 1 weiner  ar a ryme
this show was so awful I laughed most of the time I was watching it. I thought I was watching a parody.
this tv series looked like nonsense from the trailer that was launched not too long ago. being that henry cavill wasn t in it to begin with  I didn t care to watch it. Im happy Imade the right decision. xd
its woke as shit. I bailed out at the beginning of episode 2 with the queer shit.
well based on 3 seconds I cant see why that was so bad....but Im not willing to find out right now. Ive already chosen not to watch this series just because I think after what they did to henry cavill I ll be passing on all future netflix witcher stuff. frankly Im about ready to shut off netflix anyway since I dont wanna see another scandinavian turkish or korean show come down the pipeline and get told Imust watch it.... no really its great !
spoiler alert   michelle yeoh makes this series bearable  for those who have a sour taste in their mouth for all things netflix witcher these days .but yes... it takes someone of her calibur to make it better.  the lack of a villain in the series is unacceptable.  we need at least one.. just one good villain please!!!none of the  bad guys  in this series are memorable at all.  not funny  not witty  not dry  not overtly evil  not cold  not psychotic  absolutely no characteristics to make them stand out from  king s gaurd_03   other than the fact they have more speaking parts still  please watch the rest to see the cool things michelle does with the role  not that they gave her much to work with... its no  crouching tiger  hidden dragon
to quote az  this show was  utter trash .4 hours of my life I ll never get back.
man who would have thought... a show made up by a showrunner who has no respect for the games creator of the witcher franchsie made something worse than lotr rop...  its almost like we knew this was coming
feels bad  this review feels like water boarding
worse than rings  that is like saying someone is better than michael jordan. a tall order to be sure. but I have faith. dumb did have a dumber...
4 38 ... why does it look like that prop is wrapped in white trash bags  is this a recurring theme for netflix witcher stuff  black trash bags for the original series  white ones for blood origin... xd
the title is a direct rip-off of a got episode  cripples  bastards  and broken things.  sigh
the upside-down camera angle was super-stupid. there is no need to go past episode-1  it all goes downhill from there.
I stopped at episode 3  thats how bad it was
these race swaps  gender swaps  retcons and terrible writing checkboxes are getting absolutely exhausting.
playing the witcher 2 for the first time now and its sad to see the budget being wasted on a turdfest like blood origin.
Im only watching the next season if every character is female  gay  and evil. the show still makes too much sense too  I dont even want proper grammar in the next season
woke people  elves are better people woke creators  create elves societies that work exactly like white human ones they dont like. they created scottish! elves here.
the people in this show are way too clean for ancient dark age medieval civilization. that pisses me off right off the bat. learn from got guys.
!!whew! ! no catheters and ....no stalkers ! ok  safe ta come back in! dude  why in da hell would thys sell  Imean  is anyone playing that zelda game from cdi. see  niche market.....
better watch a czech movie than a woke hollywood series of bs.well... why not try to watch medieval  2022  czech republic   wow! better actors  costumes  music  dialogues  everything.
what s up with these short-haired elves in modern fantasy works man  hollywood really had this much money to burn  the coffers will eventually empty. I really hope to live long enough to see it all go down.
thanks again for watching this garbage so I dont have to!
ps2 in 2022
wow!  thatsounded horribly boring!so  I guess that means your review was perfectly accurate
blood origin is much worse than rings of power.  at least rings of power was trying and failing.
thank you for reviewing this trash that Imyself could not bring myself to watch.
ps2 grahfix
it is a slavic fairy tail without any slavic actors...   how woke is that
the  hairstyles  are the absolute lowest and worst any can go when depicting elves in a visual medium.
so I assume all of the african myth based shows will be filled with white actors   Im sure.
when will these people stop being awful
rings of power was bad  but it was hilariously bad. it was actually fun to keep watching it just to try and guess what lunacy have the writers come up with in the next episode. blood origin is just plain bad.
mel I heart you I heart you soo much but dont do the voice please the point your trying to make fall a little to the side with it
I watched all of it just so netflix would take it off my home screen. its crap.
why....just why  the first show already was a disaster  why in the heavens would you make another
do not watch next episodes  it is not worth it  and it pays writers bills. speak with your wallet.
you dont like the source material and want to do something else  thats great. create your own new original show and let s see how it goes. just dont call it the witcher. if you dont like the witcher  why would you want to name your new show that
its better than rings of power....not much but its watchable.
oh lenny henry is in it. no wonder its woke garbage
its worse than rings of power
worst year for fantasy. wheel of time  rings of power  witcher blood origin... flip my 3 fav book series crapped on so epically.
so if arnold schwarzenegger defeated those guys effortlessly would that be realistic to you
first few minutes and I knew it would be shit..
its horribly predictable at this point. Im glad I never even watched 1 minute of the original woketarded netflix witcher show. I loved the books and games too much to stand for their debasing of the source material just to score some vapid identity politics points. no thanks.
a drought on the movie theaters! no one wants to see this garbage! let alone pay for home viewing!
fascinating a woke show got beaten by another woke show whose writer brag he s smart.  ears are the only difference between people and elves in that world.
this is the most cringe  it has no character development in the plot line amateurs are running the show couldn t even write a good novel if your life depended on it
its woke garbage lol
move on  dont torture yourself with thatstuff.  you dont want to give them more views so this crap cant get a season 2.
willow tv series is the absolute worst
I never knew polish folk were so tan or had dreadlocks.isn t this cultural appropriation
its clearly an  original  crappy story which netflix decided to shoehorn into  their  witcherverse.the moment  peak era of elven civilization  was presented as a bunch of dirty peasants with pointy ears  I was done.
this is so awful I had to stop watching it.
I watched the first ten minutes its bad not even worth watching.
dont watch any more. dont give them the views  not even in hate.there are no elves there. these are the discarded unused extras from rop with fake pointy ears glued on.youre better off watching game cutscenes movies from witcher 1  2 and 3 instead of this pile of turd. because if you think it will get better... it wont. nonsensical dialoges  moonsized plotholes  clich  characters  complete disregard of the known lore. instead of expanding and building on the existing lore  they completely overthrew it and made up their own.
call me racist or whatever you want  but watching black characters in medieval fantasies is totally ridiculous.
it is God awful
it was pretty trash  tbh.
polish folklore without any polacks in it. cant wait for a kunta kinte show without any africans.
the mediocrity and predictability of pc leftwinger content of any form is starting to get comical.
this may be worse than willow  it is far worse than awful rop  just horrible. hard to recognize but this was based off polish mythology but not a pole in sight thanks to woke hollywood. woke insanity aside the acting and writing are unbelievably bad.
should only be polish cast. anyone suggesting anything else are to be exiled from healthy society.
I hear there are so many blacks in polish folklore.the blackwashing is hilarious. esg all over this crap.
if thats the worse acting you ve seen then stay away from the star wars prequels.
