as a white man  its really entertaining knowing that me merely existing causes so much stress for these weird people.
how accepting and inclusive these people are
how these people get out of bed without hurting themselves is a miracle to me. if me protecting my future girlfriend or future wife means Im hated by people then Im all for it.
I have a confession to make to everyone... Im straight and male.. there I got that out of my chest. it felt stunning and brave.
its so weird how back in the early 2000s it was super rare for people to be obsessed with race and sexuality.now its everywhere.
the whole reason ethan was even involved in viI was because he was desperately searching for his wife and then searching for a way to cure and escape with her.  everything he did was to circumvent or overcome threats that barricaded his progress to that goal.  he is completely out of his depth from moment one but he continues on.  village is even worse because it freaking starts with a betrayal  as far as he knows   the murder of his wife  and his daughter being abducted.  the fact that he can even keep going at all is freaking admirable!  again  thats before dealing with all the freaking werewolves and giant clawed women!  this whole article is total bull
james is such an interesting flawed character  and ethan is a gigachad dad
kotaku -  pay attention to me! every normal person - why are you even still here
if kotaku hates it  it has to be good  gmanlives 2022
ethan and james both had the chance to do the easy thing  and go find new wives. they didn t. call me crazy  but I dont think they re narcissists.
I dont like the protagonist in re2 because they re blonde and white.  I can only imagine this authors twitter bio.
this is a classic example of hate born out of envy.
love the fact that this all started just to create click bait headlines. now  its literally exposing mentally ill and unstable people working in journalism.
any guy who is a blonde dont let this bother you  you guys are awesome ! bet if james was female but the exact same character somehow it would make the character the best in gaming in their mind
I dont get how people can have so much hate in their heart towards so many humans  just because they have a certain hair or skin color. its insanity. its literally just the color of someone s hair or skin  it does not matter for what kind of person they are. everyone should know this by now.
I think someone just got dumped by a blonde white dude.kotaku is always good for a laugh.
I definitely feel that ethan is the blandest  and most poorly acted  of the resident evil main characters  but the fucking titanium balls he had to go through pure hell in village to get his daughter back  where many lesser men would give up the moment that truck crash happened  is purely admirable. the man didn t take no for an answer. imagine being this bitter over ethan loving his family.
hey  kids  remember when kotaku liked video games  yeah  me neither.
well kotaku doesnt know is that japan could give less of a flying f    about how kotaku feels.
Im blonde and blue. and my daughter was half puerto rican. she was also killed by a full puerto rican.  but yes white men are the danger. I bet ashley s man  well she s probably a black lesbian as that is the status quo  but if she had a man and a silent hill or resident evil scenario happened to her I highly doubt her man would go through all those trials to save her. on a side note  love your vids mel. keep calling these woke fools out!
lol right.. please stay away from us.
literally  itshows just how powerful we are that we are so feared. it is the fact we are competent and successful in the face of all adversity that creates such envy.
I use to troll people like those. now I can just stroll out in public and hear reiiiii!
for me its pure disgust and resentment that they get away with this so much
@s a  yet they wont stay out of our nations
I know right  I feel like Im voldemort. the thing is  nobody of another ethnicity has ever condemned me for being white or male to my face  its only been a couple cases of a  fellow  caucasian. its basically culture appropriation at that point.
they must really hate me for helping to produce another blond hair white male.
they love black people talking about racism in everything though.
ain t it beautiful. the lack of racism brings a year of joy to my eye.
so tolerant...
they gave up on that pretext decades ago
such tolerance  much inclusion.Im fully willing to reflect their tolerance and inclusion right back at them.
its google s fault thatshitsites like kotaku and polygon gets search result traction. it cant distinguish  rage-bait  clicks from genuine clicks in its quality score algorithms.
its insane how these people say one thing and do another  its prejudice racism and our sick society narrative is not fighting back against it... its plain sad that this is current reality... I really really despise kotaku blazu...
the writer  ashley bardhan is white herself. so its a case of white hating white.
@emma s mom  oh my wow  of course she s white!  Im not commenting on all people of euro ancestry  Im just thinking about all the bizarro ass takes on people in general and they comes from euro-descent women the most  and I have no idea why.  its like they got some widespread glitch or disorder or demonic possession or something.
why wont you just go away !
its more hating on rich upper class white men  not caucasian people
hell  Im a blond haired  blue eyed  white man of 100  german blood. so Imust be especially disturbing to them. lucky me.
I hope itstresses their hearts to the point of failure.
they re just uneducated.. lots of patience is required when it comes to people who lead those kinds of lives
rent free in their heads
we dont suffer victim mentality and they hate us for it
lol I lost my hair in chemical vapors at work so I have to shave my head from then on. I once returned from work and had to go to a post office urgently  so I went there without changing my clothes. the faces of the mid-asian immigrants when they saw a big white bald guy dressed semi-military style crossing their street
@                well you did give them civilization  my friend. must ve been a shock
@wirmer flagge  lmao
we re living rent free in their heads
as a white man as wellI find it entertaining as welll
well it is most white people complaining against white people. I love this irony
its great fun right !  Im just waiting to walk past one of these people and hear a soft hiss or a reeeee.
dont worry. soon they will have their wish come true.
they arent people they re npcs... preprogrammed
@wirmer flagge   thankfully Im not american.  my country s gun control laws are some of the tightest in the world.
I find it hilarious that my mere existence is giving them such crisis and panics. their tears fills my mug of kotaku tears!
@the blob  yeah crt actually being taught to kids rn isnt funny though. that wakeusha parade killer....shits not funny at all actually
@simon m  sorry to hear that
very hypocritical as well
@chrono logic  thanks for your input. best of luck to you!
I love getting blamed for how bad the world was hundreds of years ago.. and for them to think that its only white men that were the bad in the world lol
get out of this comments section now!... how dare you make this about you
@chrono logic  okay man  sounds good. I would say best of luck  but you dont need it - why you wish to tempt the Gods like that  only you know. but  how about - God s speed. I hope you have a chance to examine your reactivity and lack of emotional control. but thats just me  the  racial supremacist  nazI  autism chauvinist  ... whatever other mean words you used   haha!  speaking. be safe.
a different kind of priveledge  to cause seething hatred
james isn t a family man lmao
I think being balck you actually feel that in every politics vid
the article was about the author hating bland and boring male protagonists. not white men in general. thats why she pointed out the similarities between their outfits and personalities.
@s a  I apologize for being.
want to be special so bad
@jesse  same.. I guess I ll stop paying taxes and using my engineering degree so dipshits can be emotionally stable.
@thano  the people wrtinig these articles are rich and upper class  thats their background.
who are also white.
@d   read the actual article. it was all about the blandness of those characters. that they were too stereotypical. thats why they pointed out their similar outfits. gary sues exist in all types of media.
@machta shmacta  I did. youre still incorrect.
@d   then you clearly didn t.
good
I wish I had that power  im black and people wanna speak for me
@machta shmacta  incorrect. you are wrong and cant handle facts.
@d    facts   lol
@machta shmacta  no need for quotations. otherwise  yes  that is correct. facts.
@d   I just thought it was funny you called it that. because its most certainly not. just warped view of what it actually is.
@machta shmacta  it is. you not thinking it is doesnt change that it is a fact.
@d   that logic works both ways.
@machta shmacta  of course  if you are dealing with facts. which I am.
same its so satisfying knowing it triggers them lol
@d   whatever helps you sleep at night.
makes me wish I was white
@machta shmacta  not sure how you being incorrect became you talking about me sleeping. weird. youre still incorrect. I dont mind you ignoring facts.
@d   and you calling them facts doesnt make them into facts. but Im sure you know that. its just a really bad take.
@machta shmacta  I could not call them facts. they would still be facts. it isn t my words that make them facts.
@d   thats quickly become a word everyone has been throwing around to solidify their agenda. even if they know they re actually wrong. when you have so many people misusing the word  its lost all its meaning. now anything can be a  fact.
@the best the world has to offer channel  I dont understand what you mean by that
@machta shmacta  wrong again.
@d  I wish I was.
@d  still wish I was.
@machta shmacta  incorrect again.
@d   we live in a world of alternative facts.
@machta shmacta  incorrect. only facts.
@d   a world where people dont care about the truth anymore. as long as they hear what they want to hear.
@machta shmacta  incorrect.
@d   now the word  fact  means nothing. its all about whether you agree with it. if you get enough people to agree  anything can become a fact. thats what little weight it carries now.
@d  and Im sure because of this   facts  conveniently fit your narrow perspective. as long as it agrees with what youre trying to sell.
@d  if I was  this would be a different back and forth. but the truth is that you dont actually care about the facts.
@d  or maybe you just love following herd mentality. either way  youre still wrong in the end  which is ironic.
none of them actually believe a single thing they write. they know its all bullshit. they pull this crap just for clickbait. never caring the real harm it does to others.
@andrew taylor  exactly. these people are like the little kid on the playground purposely doing anything stupid just to get attention from people the only major difference is the kid on the playground isn t as annoying
I think most of us can agree. if we were stuck with someone like ashley  we d let the zombie eating commence.
@cloudspottv  well yeah why would they admit that they re wrong that would involve common sense  decency    having a brain   these type of people lack all 3 of those things
@andrew taylor  thats what I thought too cause there is no way someone who played both games would write this shit  they just want clicks and think that pissing off the fans is the best way to get them
honestly
@andrew taylor  I assure you  they do believe it. prepare accordingly.
how dare you come out of the closet  .
I like to add to that by saying Im a whyte as well.
me too! we need to start a support group  maybe at a gym.
Im a male and Im proud to be straight.
@crimzon nova  even added the thumb up.
straightpride
@zoe adkins  fuck yes!
so brave.  rolemodel
im a straight mexican republican family man who didnt go to college but learned a good trade and is able to support a family still. damn I feel so stunning an brave!
@andrew taylor  id say a good amount of them believe it. its hard for you to wrap your head around their beliefs because you have common sense  but stupid  gullible people do exist.
saying that james  problem is his horniness  means you have not understood silent hill 2 in the least.
they cant. whenever they hurt themselves they just proclaim that it was   gamur-gate!!  or  the patriarchy!!  that hurt them like the meme of the kid on the bike who jams a stick between the spokes
@thegreatpoo2electricboogaloo  dear God! you are mexican-american and a straight cis male that provides for his family  I am so triggered right now.  sarcasmGod bless you  my fellow american!  3
me too and I am white. I guess we are both stunning and brave.
genuinely stunning  genuinely brave
the love and support in these comments is amazing to watch
dont matter what race yall are shout to all my fellow straight males out there
@machta shmacta  gay people aren t oppressed  p.o.v these are articles and comments from first world countries   still choosing to turn a blind eye to trends of mistreatment toward majority groups isnt going to make oppression in the middle east or 60 years ago go away
@respectable username   you must not be familiar with the story of jeffrey dahmer.
@machta shmacta  we are living in 2022  and specific instances of mistreatment aren t a systemic issue. you ll never get rid of any -ism or -ist ideologies  because there s are over 7 billion people on earth with free will and wild minds. also  just because you get mistreated for an aspect of your identity doesnt mean other people aren t being mistreated for theirs. the group of geeks that were in the gsa at my school would literally physically attack and throw things at anyone they deemed a  cishet white male  if they got close to where they sat at lunch. mind you  I was in the group at the time  though  I didn t participate in any of that  it made me embarrassed to be associated with them  and its not like they were being provoked or had a history of being bullied at thatschool or anything  they were just being malicious toward whoever they assumed were  cishet white males . idk if its rare or whatever for that to happen even  but as someone who s gay and trans  I ain t never been treated that poorly for my identity.
@machta shmacta  family being judgemental of identity isn t just one way lol. in my theater class once in 10th grade I overheard the theater fandom girls going  if my kid someday isn t gay or trans ill disown them  while going on some spiel abt their favorite gay ships   . made me want to start a fight  but there were too many of those types of performative-activist people in the class for me to speak against discrimination without being accused of it myself. anyways youre clearly assuming the lived experience of two whole groups of people  both the one you belong to  acting like you and what you ve heard other people go through represents the majority of people  and cishet white men  implying they do not face forms of discrimination based on their identity
@respectable username   Im saying that the certain group in question are oppressed and they ve been oppressed for a long time. not everyone faces it of course  but that depends on the area they live in and the background they have. not everyone is accepting of gays and those who aren t discriminate them. when youre not allowed to be yourself  youre being oppressed.being straight has always been considered normal by society. nobody fights it because thats what we consider acceptable. and for a long time  that has also been true for being white. white dominated the us from the beginning. it was only until recently that we even got a black president. hence why I say that whites aren t being oppressed. they ve never been oppressed when they practically own this country.
@machta shmacta  also  again  third time I need to remind you  we are talking about present day. 2022. not the past. you cant justify your enabling of the suffering of groups today with a  well they did it to us  before they were ever alive      . thats stupid  get real.
@respectable username   discrimination is more than just ridicule. there s beatings and death involved too so thats not something to be taken lightly.
@machta shmacta   there are a handful of people who do not respect me therefore I am oppressed  no
@respectable username   that kind of ignorance must be nice..
it felt stunning and brave haha I laughed so hard dude thankyou
@respectable username  dude I get told daily on the internet trying to have political conversations I dont get to have a viewpoint or an opinion because Im a male  Im straight or Im white and then somehow they bring up me being a Christian discredit my viewpoints. that happens every day lol the people making lgbtq jokes are probably joking for the most part. there s probably some truth in there in the sense of they dont actually want their kid to be lgbtq  but thats not you being discriminated against. do you want your kid to be a Christian  I doubt it. that doesnt mean Im discriminate against as a Christian. I dont want my kid to be lgbtq. especially if you were bragging about how much discrimination lgbtq people face. why on earth would I want my kid to face that  if I do have one I ll just down him to put him out of his misery lol I also noticed black people and lgbtq people will face the same exact situation straight white people will face instead of saying everyone gets pulled over unfairly  they ll say I got pulled over because I was black or I got treated this way because Im lgbtq. maybe everyone has things happen to them they disagree with. it doesnt mean you just get to say all of society in general believes this way. if you come out as lgbtq  youre getting put on the cover of a magazine. yeah there are people who disagree with it. congratulations there are many people who disagree with my religion or my lifestyle I want him to be married to one person and only having sex with one partner or a woman after Im married. none of your friends agree with my lifestyle and you dont agree with my lifestyle  I have not been perfect with these beliefs  but you dont think thats the moral thing to do. you probably dont care if I want to practice these beliefs  I dont care if you wanna practice yours but I dont have to agree with yours and I dont have to want your sexual preferences or orientation and I can actively be wanting the opposite for my kids  just like you probably dont want your kids to be a straight white Christian male who ways to have sex until marriage or you aren t going to raise your kids to be that. you dont have to agree with my lifestyle  I dont have to agree with yours. we dont have to want it for each others kids. except youre not gonna be able to have kids if youre lgbtq because the stork doesnt bring babies. at least not biological without doing something very abnormal. which I dont care what you do in your life. there s no your lifestyle is going against biology.
@respectable username   and a third time I am speaking about the present. not everyone has a sheltered life like you did. it happens whether you see it or not.
@respectable username  also Imeant to respond to think about lgbtq people to the other guy  not you but itsays I replied to you. this guy literally used jeffrey dahmer  a gay man killing other gay men is an example of gay people being discriminated against lol and Im pretty sure that was before any of us were even born.
@machta shmacta  being straight has always been considered normal for society because that is normal for society and is objectively biologically normal to even have a society. dont try in church it up like we now realize thats not normal. no that is normal. but youre free to do what you want but you are not free to rationally see if people dont agree with me  even though I dont agree with their lifestyles  they hate me but I dont hate them and I disagree with their lifestyle
@jesse  you missed the entire point. jeffrey dahmer got away with his crimes because no one in the police force cared to look into a gay person s affairs. the fact that no one cares unless its happening to them is still very much an issue today as well. and that goes beyond my argument. people flatout turn a blind eye to the suffering of others. thats what made dahmer s case so significant and that was the context of my example. it was one example of oppression and the message it teaches is still relevant today because society has the same problems.
@jesse   well Im sorry you feel that way but I dont regret what I said. some child being too ignorant to comprehend the fact that certain groups of people are still being discriminated against is indeed ignorant. and you enabling their intolerant behavior makes you no better.
@machta shmacta  oppression     getting your feelings hurt by individuals. thats what you dont understand. youre trying to say that because people used to get beat and killed for something  that they re oppressed right now just bc a few individuals still dont like gay people. when only a small group of people in a country dislike you to the point its normalized and encouraged for you to call them out on their behavior if they act mean to your group even on accident  youre not oppressed. thatsimple . support and neutrality toward the lgbt community far exceed the amount of people who are actively homophobic transphobic. and again  some individuals not liking you doesnt make you oppressed. when youre so discriminated against that your life is literally impeded despite any courage you show to persevere  and despite effort and blocking out the words of haters  then you can claim oppression. but when participating in whatever makes you that identity  you are not having your rights or protections revoked  youre not oppressed .
@jesse  man youreally went out here and typed this whole novel full of facts!!!! I want you to know that there s no real  out  in that conversation btw.. like when it comes to having your opinions or freedoms silenced restricted for being cishet white male. because ...as a light skinned middle eastern trans gay man  ftm ... I get called cis white hetero male all the time when people want to silence me. to the point that even when I correct people on the assumptions  they either accuse me of either lying  or they accuse me of having  internalized transphobia   in the instances where Im like  ok Im literally not a male though  I was born a woman and I have the body of one  you have no ammunition to silence my opinion abt abortion  for example . these labels are being treated like lgbt labels were treated in the 90s . used as insults  used to silence and alienate people  etc.  even in instances when its inapplicable  like calling a straight kid gay to make them feel like no one wants to be around them . disheartening that people in the lgbt community can claim to know how much discrimination and oppression hurt  and yet cant even tell when they are participating in it
@respectable username   youre downplaying the suffering of others. thats what you dont understand. if you are ever in a situation where you cannot be yourself because you fear harassment physically and emotionally then you are being oppressed. if you cannot practice your own religion because you are fearful of what others in your community might do to you then you are being oppressed. that happens to this day. not the past. the present. if it were only a handful of people as you say  then I wouldn t care about discussing it. then the far right wouldn t even exist. but I guess it doesnt exist according to you because you haven t experienced it in your neck of the woods.
@respectable username   harassment is harassment. it doesnt matter how small or large it is. you dont just downplay someone else s suffering and claim the moral high ground. the world doesnt work like that. you can feign ignorance all you like  its still ignorance.
@respectable username   so again  if you cannot be yourself in your community because you are fearful of what others may do to you then you are being oppressed. it doesnt matter the extent of that harassment. if it interferes with your day to day then it becomes a huge problem.
@respectable username   my argument hasn t changed since you first spoke. and since then  you ve shown examples of wilfull ignorance and attempts to downplay a certain group s suffering. according to you and by your words  its not enough to get ridiculed or harassed. because it doesnt count as oppression by your bizarre standards. it doesnt exist if you haven t seen it in your town. and according to you  Im apparently referring to the past despite the fact that I only mentioned it once and that was the case of jeffrey dahmer. so as I said  if you cannot be yourself in your environment because you are fearful of what others may do to you then you are oppressed. thats what it means to be oppressed. you are forced to hide everything that you are and forcing yourself to be something youre not so that you may live as normal of a life as possible. maybe that doesnt mean anything to you but if you actually lived it  you would understand how horrible it is. and that mental pain has driven many over the cliff  so to speak.
@machta shmacta  yes being ridiculed and harassed doesnt count as oppression  just like punching someone isn t committing genocide. there s different words and phrases for things of different severities. like wanting strict border patrol doesnt make someone a n zI  wanting a better welfare system doesnt make someone a c mmunist  having self confidence doesnt make someone a narcissist  etc. there s different levels. oppression is when there is so much discrimination that you are genuinely unable to have the same opportunity as other groups. you have equal rights  youre not being actively intimidated into not using your rights by any large group of people that you would reasonably feel overwhelmed by  and youre not unable to be in a position of highest authority  some of our highest branches of government have had many lgbt people in power positions . genuinely I cannot see how you would think thatsomeone calling you a mean word or scolding you for your  sins  or whatever would make you oppressed. if you can go get any job you want  make a life for yourself  settle down and have a family legally  and participate in whatever legal activities you d like to that anyone else can  youre not oppressed.
@machta shmacta  also  my argument hasn t changed you claimed cishet white men aren t oppressed  so I said lgbts aren t oppressed then  in first world countries . you then claimed that harassment   oppression  and further stated that any level of harassment   harassment. which  if youre keeping up  would mean that you think cishet white men are oppressed  as they are harassed  no matter the intensity  in your opinion  as we reiterated before . you then followed that with once again flip flopping  now to  cishet white men aren t harassed   which is a complete contradiction to your previous statements that no matter the intensity  harassment is harassment  and harassment is oppression. because that is what you have been saying  but then you say things that actively contradict it. youre unstable and dont know what youre even saying. find your footing before engaging in a debate lest you embarrass yourself more.
@respectable username   you dont get to decide what other people are going through. if someone is suffering then they are suffering. you can downplay it  pretend like its small all you want. the truth is still there. and whether you  belong  to the group or not  that doesnt give you a free token to claim what qualifies as oppression and suffering.
@respectable username   Im sorry you feel that way. I guess that embarrassment is something we both have in common then.
@respectable username   so  again. white  straight men are not oppressed. why  because not only are they the dominant populace but they are also the majority everywhere in the media. whatever you claim or have seen pales in comparison to this fact. I do not change this argument as it is still indeed as true as from my original post.
@machta shmacta  ran out of fuel huh   tryna get in a last gotcha  silly shit.
@respectable username   ran out of what  you  my dear  are having delusions. lol
@respectable username   want me to repeat everything I said  or do you have more senseless bigotry to spill
@machta shmacta   bigotry   nah you gotta be a troll. imagine telling someone they re a bigot because they understand word definitions and understand people s experiences outside of their own bubble. first time Ive heard the take  not being a fascist makes you a bigot   hope its the last.
@respectable username   if you did any of that  we would be having a completely different conversation.
@machta shmacta  your terminally online view of society isn t an accurate reflection of reality. go outside
@respectable username   interesting take. now if only it actually meant something relevant.
brave  so brave.
stunningandbrave
we d eliminated racism almost completely but the major focus on it from one side of the political party s since around 2010 and onward  has brought it back sadly
lack of achievements  ppl resort to labels to excuse their failures. remember when special meant disabled
they had to make us defenseless for what was to come next.
@iron pulcinella  I remember when special meant  you actually could get a good meal.
well ted  because a divided people who are shallow can be kept in check through their petty desires  indulgences and gripes are easy to manage.  a good occupational force doesnt quell  it corrupts  masada  1981
@hey baby  come to butthead  the term itself was created to shame the finns for not wanting to enjoy the same wonderful treatment from the soviet union  such as what happened to the ukrainians.
@rambleon07  really source
thanks blacks
@snuse mcgoose  Ive thought a lot about this recently. I think we were on a good path towards moving past racism. for the most part  it was publicly unacceptable and people were trying to work through it. but  Ive seen rascism on all ends  up close  and I agree that there were are some real issues that needed to surface. just.. not handled how we are handling it now ffs.the reality is that in the us there are pockets of racist culture  and in general people are at least a little prejudice by nature. for some reason the entire population is being punished for the actions beliefs of relatively insignificant groups. there s also the ramifications of systemic racism  which I think was mostly just companies government exploiting situations for profit more than anything else.it was a clever way to point the blame back at the public and take eyes off of the actual issues. now we have this new breed of hateful people that think they re righteous.I wouldn t say we had fixed it  but we were on a better path than the past. but now its certainly worse than it was before all this started ffs.honestly if someone wants to hate me for whatever... whatever. as long as we can stay focused on the biggest issues of our time which are undoubtedly  wealth is being sucked up by the uber wealthy  humanity is being un-unified and held back to serve the interest of the very few  we are being further placed into an economic based slave system.
maybe we should look into who owns hollywood and the news organization promoting this.
they cant afford for it to disappear  given their inherent lack of talent its the only way they can pay the bills.
@ender  I was convinced of that tidbit by researching finland after the fall of imperial russia. thatshould tell you the bias of the sources that led me to such a thought. you are on the internet. you should look up a bunch of sources and come up with your own opinion. thats how I arrived at my own opinion. tbf  it would probably be more accurate to say that he redefined and populated the term in the modern sense. and if you want the sources I used  I dont even know if they still exist or where they were because it was years ago.
its useless to point out the source. you get censored or people just dont care.
@rambleon07  well the reason I asked is cause I can google anything but that just means anything can be written up  fact or fictional  source implies youread it in a history book or someone that has crediblity not that it was made up. cause I can say the earth is flat and post articles but doesnt make it true  a source is who said it  and if they have crediblity then they vet the info even if you didnt.
@ender  if you know anything about history  you know that history books are at best  accurate.  no matter what book it is or who the author is  you have to do all of the legwork in checking their work through their sources all the way to the primaries and the alternatives to those sources. and at the end  you will have to accept that it is at best speculative.
@ender  if you grant anyone the position to define history  you have made them a priest and yourself a worshipper.
@snuse mcgoose  lmaooo removed racism  as long as humans r around itll nvr cease  its in our nature to hate each other
@rambleon07  then how do you learn history  from the ether  from the void  ohh from books  sounds like your worshipping then by your logic  reading a news article thats worship  cause you werent there and today s news is yesterday s history.
divide and conquer...vote based on emotion...easier to control people
@papI chulo  maybe in your circles  not in mine. when and where I grew up if we were playing or hanging out and somebody mentioned the fact thatsomebody was asian or black while we were chilling we d be like  uh wtf    nobody brought that crap up back then because its racist  who cares if they re asian or black  to me that was just lilly and james when we were hanging out. they were just people to me I didn t see otherwise then and still dont.
@ender  you failed completely to understand my point. what I said is that you should do as much research as you can  make a best guess  and understand that it is a guess. that  is the study of history. everyone has biases and no information is certain. generally  its best policy to work off of primary sources and archeology. but  you always have to understand that youreally dont know. you just have evidence that can be interpreted to suggest something.
well when you give a group of very unimpressive individuals a microphone  thats what you get.
culturally  with the exception of roughly similar technology  the 2000s were more similar to the 1980s than the present day  Im glad I grew up then rather than putting up with the shit today s kids have to go through especially in the school system.
@anonymous cheese  the  white haters  back in the 60s were limited to a bunch of non mainstream counter culture whiners though  very few were in any position of influence culturally or politically  most movies and video games during the 2000s were as pro white and pro male as james bond or lost in space.
they re not obsessed with the races  they re obsessed with being antiwhite.and if you look for it in the media it was even back then  just the amount of demographic white erasure wasnt as extreme then as it is now. so its easier to find today.
we sacrifed one bad thing for a worse one
@what is real  the same people Jesus kicked out of the temple. the same people who had Jesus crucified by the roman s.
@alexander  tru
@old boy  unfortunately
@what is real  hmm I wonder
@patrick henry  and if you question or criticize them they will destroy your life now
oh Im sure these people were about 3-10 years old when silent hill 2 or tekken 3 came out for example and they were playing and hating james and heihachI the whole time and swearing one day they ll be writers who can open up about all the things wrong with the characters from their childhood.I also remember how I played football for 10 years and hated everything about it and always swore I ll be a professional football protested when I grow up.
@kalle metsahalme  thats typical everyone says that ll be this when they grew up I said I ll be at least 5 different things when I grow up
it hasn t been this bad since the 1940 s
@setnakt spears  t re bad
the golden era
@jayindecent  yes. and they ve been doing it for as long as there have been countries to subvert.
@snuse mcgoose  you guys stop being racist towards blacks but everyone else is fair game
@snuse mcgoose  because you saw value in them  they were docile versions they had to learn to survive but a latino is beneath you im sure
@xx o-deathshot-o xx  lol nope I never said that either  but you are right now  and itshows what kind of person you are. I dont judge people by their race I judge them by their individual actions because we re all individuals that are made up by our life choices  not the ethnicity of our skins. if you have a problem with that then you seriously need to take a step back and look at whose acting like the racist here
@snuse mcgoose  ur skin is ur uniform you judge people based on what you believe is will give you the best outcome    and are in ur social networking circle
I doubt these people even played the games they re talking about.
@dragzx  100  believe that  we all know game journos cant get past the first 5 mins of a game.
game journo  hey  how do I beat this boss  gamer  thats not a boss its the first obstacle of the tutorial and its painted on the fucking wall of the level how you progress  jump and dash.game journo  oh... no doesnt work. 1 10. game is buggy.
not to mention ethan literally came back from the dead to protect his family and then died a second time sacrificeing his own life to ensure his wife and daughter got to safety
@zerovin  now thats a good father
@ashlyn brown  somebody give my man ethan a  world s greatest father  mug!
@thedomoking  5 minutes is quite generous my dude  I find it a feat in itself they know how to proceed from the main menu at this point.
@morson kaappi  only reason I gave them that long is because some games start with a cutscene
absolutely. I am f cking psyched for the silent hill 2 remake  as well as the other games and even the movie. not really ascension  though. I ll have to see more to have a proper opinion on that one.
gigadad
@ashlyn brown  thats a damn good man.
@ashlyn brown  correction a greater man  and a even better father!
@zerovin  incorrect. he came back from the dead two times and then died a third time. he died in the first game when jack stomped on him and then when miranda killed him. the only reason he didn t come back the third time because the mega mine see it was destroyed. sorry to be nerdier than you
@jesse  I forgot about that  doesnt change anything about what I said though  I can only hope to be even a tenth like that badass
@pelon morales  ethan winters and harry mason definitely deserve to get world s greatest fathers mugs
ethan is still one of the most bland re protagonists. leon  chris  carlos  barry  claire  rebecca  and jill are all better
@pelon morales  give it to barry instead
@emil carter  ethan and harry have been through sacrificed themselves from the horrors no one would imagine  while they had something far more valuable to them and couldn t bear their children living in a world of what they went through. and I believe this tops off why for my list. he s a family man.
they re both men with families that would put their lives on the side in order to keep their family and friends safe from harm. which is also another reason why ethan deserves that mug.
lmao facts
I was like people still read kotaku   dont they just do political news now
literally! the last time I saw anything kotaku-related must have been months ago by now and those news were about them being close to a shutdown. seeing this video actually made me go  they are still around !
@phaerroh  unfortunately they are.
I forgot about them until now. for a moment I forgot what they even do.
@sindrogo  they do sociopolitical ranting  not news covered by a very thin veneer of gaming.
that was my  reaction as well.    holy shit. kotaku is still a thing!     awww. good for them.
you dont get it  this is a message to capcom and konamI  better not make a white man the protagonist of your next game or you ll get low review scores  the ideal would be a sassy black girl or woman  but a white masculine woman or girl would be fine too .
Im having trouble even trusting youtubers from the west coast cause donut media just came out and insulted tucker carlson  with what as far as I cantell  is slander.I think these people are gettin money from uncle gavin
@bryan  listen to everything but trust no one  you wont regret it
who is kataku
@bal zs p ti  yes.also  family guy also went in on laura ingraham the demonirats always do that when they dont want their zombies to listen to someone. slander em  the zombees will just ree without looking into anything. has worked like a charm on their zombees since 2008-2016 first programming
gman  kotaku is a piece of sheeeeeyat!
what s tucker said specifically thats so questionable  make sure you quote the date of the show and I ll look it up. but I d bet money that you wont
@farharbor317  they may not be a thing anynmore for the general gaming public  but in the developers gaming journalist bubble they are highly influential  just like resetera.
@sindrogo  political takes  not news.
most of them dont actually play video games. they re paid to smear content for clicks and likes.
they aren t. not even close. this is the furthest thing from narcissistic behavior.
personally if I saw that house where mia was in in res 7 I would just go  ahh we had a good run love peace  so yeah I cant relate
uh... james killed his wife  didn t he  its been years since I watched someone play  horror games used to freak me out  so I could be wrong.
uh james situation was a bit different. and technically you do get an ending where he does just that. sort of. but its a cyclical ending.
@theredheadwiththread  he did  yes  but not out of malice she was ill  and so he did it out of mercy  but carries guilt over feeling relieved to not have to look after his ailing wife anymore   and the trauma resulting from that caused him to repress that memory  so at the start of the game  he thinks she died of her disease. he then gets a letter from her  in her handwriting  telling him to come see her in silent hill.my point was  he could ve just said   nope   and moved on with his life. he didn t.
@diaz de los muertos  thank you. also  now I want to try playing it myself.
@theredheadwiththread  great! I hope you do! its one of those games you never forget.
that would ve been a funny plot twist. they say   I love you wife but  its a nope for me. Im going to have to say bye .
@dempos  that would be hilarious. and the game is just them running away from their wives. and its a horror where youre hiding from your pursuer lol
she must be bitter her yaoI fanfic was rejected.
yeah  gonna go ahead and put good money on pronouns on the first line.
bet they have pronouns in there bio
and somehow they think saying that isn t racism
@peter janssen  she they he xe
the funny thing is watching the resident evil 2 remake trailer at the time  watching fans react to it. the first was two black guys   oh shit is that leon   yes!!!! the next up was a mexican dude and his girlfriend   leon fuck yes.  the fans were going nuts  meanwhile at buzzfeed  groups of white women are acting offended on their behalf about representation  lol.
Im more interested in their early life section in wikipedia
evil can not create.
@lovin ade  I guess thats why xbox cant release a game on time.
@billy paxton  you sony ponies are really cringe.
@eodyn7  playstation has been the superior console for a long time lol. either way it doesnt matter pc was   is  and will always be king.
@eric spencer  and literally none of the ones you named are pc exclusive. they came out shitty on all platforms lol.
@diaz de los muertos  I dunno if I d say he did it out of mercy. he looked pretty angry when he put that pillow over her face
I dont know anything about ethan  but james I feel is more a tragic character who is in silent hill for a reason.  your gameplay dictates his motives for coming to silent hill. sadly the water ending is the most relatable.
@theredheadwiththread  he killed his wife  but his motives as to why are unclear  its the reason he came back to silent hill  to confront all that. based on your game play  he could have completely blanked on her death and honestly been looking for her with a sense of hope  or he was going there to kill himself.  some of the reasons based on game play is he wanted his life back from her  so he ended hers. others are he was struggling with the fact thatshe was mentally and physically deteriorating and there was no cure anyway so he ended it fast for her. basically depending on how you play the game there isn t really one reason  there is a bunch of reasons.  james is an interesting protaganist  becasue he seems really simple  but the nature of the game and his version of silent hill make him complex  and frankly the water ending makes the most sense for him. dark as that is.
@burnwitch  well  here s the thing  silent hill is a twisted mirror it looks inside you and reflects what itsees  but the image is always distorted or corrupted in some way. for james  its preying upon his guilt. its as if the whole town is telling him   youre a monster  james. you deserve to suffer as much as she did.  I dont think you cantake anything itshows you at face value.
@diaz de los muertos  james definitely didn t kill his wife because she was I ll the whole idk last half of the game shows you this and shows you the kind of person she was and why james did what he did. the 2 bad endings have you take on basically sick wife 2.0 or off yourself so uh what silent hill 2 did you play
ethan might be one of the most selfless characters in video game history! 1st he risks his life to save his wife then does it again for his daughter ..that man went through hell for his family  and james was ultimately a good husband who cared for his dying wife and suffered too. james is more complicated depending on the ending but he s a great representation of how complex people can be and how hard it is to do the  right  thing at times. narcissists ..lol
@malygos  the kind of person she was  do you mean her mood swings  which were brought on by the mental deterioration she had suffered  that resulted from her disease  the disease which was terminal  incurable  and which no doctor could offer any positive prognosis for sure  her being unpleasant to be around made it easier to make his decision  and the town absolutely calls him out for that  further compounding his guilt  but if youre suggesting he killed her because she was a bitch  then why wouldn t he just let her die from her disease and prolong her suffering  and if he did kill her before her disease could  but solely for the reason youre assuming  then isn t that  at least  an act of mercy  sort of a   sure  I want the bitch dead  but Im not a total bastard I ll give her a quicker way out   and  if thats the case  why would he feel guilty about that at all  and  if he got away with it which he clearly did why would he kill himself over it  he d be a free man  in more ways than one  wouldn t he
@malygos  just so you know  your last comment is invisible for all I know  my last reply to you might be invisible too  so without using spicy gamer words  Im going to try to explain to you my position a little better.you mentioned the  bad ending   the one where he tells maria she should get that cough checked out  right  okay  so do youremember what happened right before that  you hear mary s letter being read out again  by mary herself  only this time  it goes on longer much longer  and she apologizes for how she treated him  admits thatshe lashed out at everyone she loved but especially him as a result of dealing with the fact thatshe was going to die  and nothing was going to change that. she goes on to imply that james began to withdraw from her because of her behavior  and says she is afraid that he doesnt want her around anymore  thatshe has become burdensome to him  but understands why and forgives him for that. she also says thatshe told the nurse not to give him the letter until she was already gone. she then encourages him to start living for himself from now on  and because this monologue is so well delivered by the voice actress  you almost feel hopeful  until . . . james and maria are walking back to his car  she starts coughing  and then he almost callously says that final line  betraying his ultimate indifference to her  and  symbolically  to mary. this is further bolstered by the fact that james tells maria that he wants her  but not that he loves her. mary s extended letter also implies that because of her condition  she no longer felt beautiful  and worried that james no longer felt any attraction toward her. this is symbolized by the fact that maria  whilst looking just like mary  dresses much sexier than she ever did she is a manifestation of james s underlying sexual frustration. the frustration of a man who is married to an ailing wife. each of the game s endings are determined by how you play the game  but each ending also contains a piece of the entire truth. if this is the ending you got  or rather  if this is the james you got  then it is entirely a reflection of how you played as the character. this is part of what makes the game such a masterpiece  what you see as his sole reasoning for doing what he did is only partially the reason its one straw out of many upon the camel s back. turns out  its complicated  as life ofttimes is.since you mentioned a couple of the other endings  I have to assume that you ve seen them yourself  but if thats the case  then Im a little baffled that this was your hardline takeaway from it all.trust me  Ive played the game. more than a couple times. I could probably write a dissertation on it. you saw my initial explanation for what james did and why  and I guess you found it overly simplistic  or just wrong  but what I said was not untrue  it just wasn t the full picture. thats because I was being intentionally vague  so as to not give the whole story away. I actually want people in this comment thread  who haven t played it  to do so. it is an experience thatshould not be missed.
@diaz de los muertos  this is true  but dont spoil it for people. as you say later it is one of the best games  d
@slayerthegreat010  sorry  Im doing my best not to  but I wasn t expecting to have to argue with someone about the complexity of the main character s motivations. the nice thing about the game is that even if itseems like I just dropped a lot of info about its plot  it barely even scratches the surface I didn t even mention any of the other characters  or what pyramid head s deal was.
coughs maria ending
@moon freak -  yeah  see the above discussion we covered it. plus  even if thats your ending  james still goes to silent hill when he doesnt have to.
facts.
I just assume mentally ill until proven otherwise when someone says they re a journalist
sensationalism
thankyou
despite that version of james also killing her husband lol. considering thats what james did to his wife.
my name is james I have blonde hair and blue eyes lmao
@chandler burse  kotaku might like that...
but now pyramid head wouldn t be as intimidating now wouldn t it
thanks  that actually means a lot to hear. its refreshing to not be automatically hated.
@chandler burse  especially because of that version of james killing her husband.journos would somehow interpret it as empowering.
except jews
ya know  there s a word for this  and they call us that while they do it.
maybe she catfished him.
I feel like they took inspiration from harry mason of silent hill.
thats because her dad left for cigarettes  and never came back.
ethan literally came back from the dead twice for his family and still sacrificed himself at the very end for them  if that isn t a man worth respecting  then there is definitely something wrong with the world
yeah what he did was amazing but his personality was boring as shit. had nothing to do with his appearance though.
@haruka may  hard to have a personality when youre scared shitless trying not to die
@zerovin  I just played the shadows of rose dlc. make that three times lol.
@itssegaman  spoilers much  damn why do people like you have to exist
@zerovin  you ll have to take that up with my mom
@zerovin  dude  you literally just spoiled village. you have no room to talk.
@xeno solarus  the difference is that village has been out for 2-3 years  the people who are even on this video have probably played it and within that 2-3 year timeframe most people have already played it or have seen it played through. the dlc hasn t even been out a month
think you d have to go back to roughly  pre-2010   - 2y.
I do but Im an old fossil lolseriously  way back in the day they did but in the last 10 years or so they went down the shitter.
lol!!!!
@theredheadwiththread  kotakus staff at this point looks like someone created a bunch of characters in a game by hitting the random button in the character creator.
@luke  lmao accurate
in the early  early days of their site they did.
my condolences for you daughter.
much appreciated travis
@chrono wolf x  no problem. I hope you have a great night.
dont ever give up  even even when the antiwhitism is unrelenting  your ethnicity matters too  and youre race is not a sin
you too travis!
@chrono wolf x  thank you!
my condolences as well.
james sunderland is one of the most well written characters in the history of gaming. the aloof dialog  the unnerving voice acting  and one of the most tragic twist endings ever written. its a masterpiece.kotaku drives me fucking nuts.
the world makes me angry  but melonie mac brings positivity and inspiration to us all. Ive been a fan for I think what must be a decade now. keep fighting the good fight miss mac!
not gonna lie  mel being scared of horror videos games is kind of adorable.
it gets more sickening by the day. they can spout their racism all day long but the moment you sneeze the wrong way  youre crucified for it.
she admitted she wanted drama for clicks  thats what all these places have been reduce to.
silent hill 2 was the best game in the series. I am also a blond haired  blue eyed white man. that has nothing to do with the game. the story is what made itso good in combination with the scary environment. you will love it melonie.
lol. they re not  boring   they re called  everyman  characters. but you cant even tell kotaku that either because gasp  man  james sunderland  even despite the terrible voice acting and dull personality  is one of the most interesting characters ever created for a video game. what a journey that guy goes on. what a beautiful and tragic story that guy s life tells. he quite literally descends into hell  the darkest recesses of places he couldn t understand or even conceive of  without a second thought  for the woman he he s in love with and doesnt understand why he s doing it because he knows she s dead. and in the process of this he undergoes a deep psychological transformation in which he becomes a better human being who stands up in the terrifying face of the wrong deeds he s committed and his profound desire to be punished for them  depending how you play the game  anyway .the  leave   good canon  ending of silent hill 2 will reach into your chest and squeeze your heart until tears come out of your eyes.but yeah never mind all that deep  emotional  incredible crap. what s most important is the color of the protag s skin  hair  and the fact that he s a he.fight the patriarchy kotaku  youre making a difference
I remember back in the day watching my oldest sister playing silent hill 2 on the ps2  its pretty creepy but it is a beautiful masterpiece thanks to the setting and the monsters looking scary.
I honestly thought kotaku went out of business like 8 years ago.
I think its funny how she calls ethan and james literally the same  then only cites their hair color  and having more interesting s os as similarities.which  no  james  late wife is not more interesting than him. even the final boss is just his own inner demons masquerading as her.
at least ethan and james didn t have to deal with getting catcalled
your a rare gem! and a breath of fresh air. definitely wish not only was there more women but people like you in the world  it would be a better place. thank you for all of the effort you put in to these videos its greatly appreciated. God bless
james in sh2 was intended to be emotionally disconnected  numb  depressed. them judging for the character for not being like  omgomgomgomgomg  all the time is insane.
ethan winters dialogue isn t the most intriguing but its what the character stands for that is so amazing. he isn t a spiky haired anime badass. he is a guy who loves his family and would literally face he ll head on in order to save them. the amazing thing is that for a lot of the game you do feel like your out of your league when you play as ethan but it just makes it more satisfying when we can not only save our family but completely put an end to the problem thatstarted ethan s story to being with. great games and a great protagonist
Im just so happy we have so many horror games coming out in the next few months. the callisto protocol  resident evil 4  sillent hill 2  re8 dlc  dead space. idc what these clowns say  I feel like a kid on a Christmas morning.
I can see why you cant empathize with these men who love their family I know you ve never played silent hill 2 but this was really funny to hear if you knew the context of james.
capcom s resident evil showcase yesterday was awesome.  I dont like everything capcom does but its pretty clear the people working on re really care about the games they are making and the fans.  super excited for both the winters expansion and re4 remake.
apparently Im evil then. hmm didn t know that. I guess Im doomed and everyone hates me. well at least Im saved by the grace of God. so I know Ive him on my side. good video melonie. and go boom!
this will be spoilers for silent hill 2  but...the whole journey through silent hill for james was a twisted reflection of his feelings  he felt incredibly guilty for killing his wife  despite the fact he did so because of how much she was suffering in her illness  the experience of surviving silent hill is a deeply personal journey for him because of how it is pulling from him to form the nightmares  and despite the fact that konamI puts pyramid head everywhere that is remotely associated with silent hill  it was actually the monstrous version of how james saw himself
kotaku has been in a race with itself directly to the bottom of the dumpster.
simp!  kidding...melonie s legit  adorable or not.
could be anxiety. I have anxiety and horror games used to make me freak out. now I can play them as long as its daylight or the lights are on lol
I dont know if she s like me or not  but I tend to be okay with things that are genuinely frightening like jump scares  but absolutely cant deal with any gore as its nauseating to say the least. thats one thing I never could get used to with horror movies and games  if it has even a bit of gore in it. I tend to feel the same way about other genres thatsometimes have gore in them like action as well.
@tea burn  gore doesnt bother me but the jump scares mess with my anxiety.  where is it going to jump out from and when
now thats a proper girl right there! my kinda girl. a girl who isn t scared of horror movies is a strong independent woman who dont need no man. gross!
its crazy  as a black guy this kind of racism and hate towards another race is absolutely repugnant  these people are openly racists and they re cheered and revered for it  what a messed up world we re living in. hating people for being blonde is not really different than hating people for having darker skin.
its so hard to tell who s serious and who isn t now  but luckily us normal people can laugh at either one.
the remake looks like a dark anthology game and james really is not that emotional. he s numb on what he did thats why he search for answers.
the silent hill story line is wonderfully insane  complex  twisted  camp   kitsch  all with an  intriguing mystery  you love to explore. the developers really captured that appalachian melancholic mood  the american gothic feel and even the small town americana.and there s something hypnotic about the story line outside the order plot line of an eerie ghost town that draws in lost souls and broken people and leads them through hell  n limbo...and faceless nurses with big boobs.
both games were lit
@norman readdis  I dont see how it looks like a supermassive game. because it has realistic graphics now  like what
@chandler burse if you play the og game you ll know. its not about the graphics.
@norman readdis  but how does that make it a until game  it doesnt even look the same it looks more like the trailer for silent hills did or not the trailer but the one thatshowed norman reedus at the end.
@norman readdis  Ive seen plenty of the og games its just more realistic why do people see newer graphics on remade games and then find anything about the style to say its not the same so itsucks. Ive seen people do this with re2make they hated the rpd was now dark and wasn t lit anymore. people said something about dead space remake cmon. I need more context than  it looks like another game even though I cant provide any real backup to thatstatement of how it does.
@chandler burse  you didn t understand what Imeant. its not about the graphics.  if you played the og you know how off this remake is. sh is about a certain philosophical experience  re is just a zombie survival game.
I always got the water ending.... its kinda hard to feel like james could come back after all that.
why they always lying
I always thought guy cihI was a great voice actor. he hit every emotional line as hard as he needed to. despite the weird style of directing he had to work with. they didn t even tell him what the monsters even looked like.
the voice for james was perfect.

@castelar garcia  holys  t...thats a lot of movies you listed. Im impressed.
we can only dream
its utterly bizarre they still have money at all  where the heck is that money coming from even when they are the laughing stock of most gamers.
sadly  no.  they re not wildly popular  but a lot of  gaming  youtubers and channels reference many of their articles.  which is sad because kucktaku needs to go under.
ign  vox  buzzfeed  salon  slate  huffpo  daily beast are all the same crap as kotaku.
@nobleomnicide  but the question is how is that generating traffic or ad revenue enough to support thatsite and all the people working there who get paid monthly to write utter good-for-nothing toxic crap I wouldn t even feed to a stray cat on a napkin because it might poison the cat.
@adam  ign to a lesser degree  but yeah  they are all a blight on gaming and geek culture.
@adam  dont agree about ign. they re slowly getting worse but its not quite there
I remember a good chunk of their staff getting fired or quitting over a short time  so like you  Im confused how they even stay afloat
what the fuck is kataku
if only.
@william edwards  I dunno about jason. he loved the crunch and drama articles  and he just provided the  evidence  against the bayonetta voice actor that mentioned low pay. to each their own but I dont care for him just like the rest.
@geddoe316  never said I liked him. lol. Im just able to separate my personal feelings with an objective statement. he s a prick and he was the last good writer kotaku had  that in of itself  is not exactly the best thing either.
they probably get money from blackrock and the like to keep pushing  the message .
yea I remember when my browser start page used to have ign  gamespot  kotaku  gametrailers  gamespy  eurogamer and half a dozen other game sites that existed then Im having hard time even recalling now. now I cant imagine what a paper magazine made by most of these companies would be. even the foreword column on first page would be something about  future of gaming needs less males  or  the problem with james sunderland . itsays something when steam reviews are more helpful  game-centric and game-positive than the  game magazines
here here!!!
yes  its a wonderful time to be a horror gamer!
seriously  its a great time to be a horror game enthusiast!
indeed  indeedIm ready for resident evil village  gold edition   resident evil 4 remake.so bring it on
re4 remake looks like capcom learned after re3r  we ll still have to wait and see but Im fairly optimistic
cant wait for kotaku or polygon to complain about ashley s ballistics haha
I dont really care for resident evil but I love how you can now play in 3rd person. Im definitely buying gold edition.
is that why capcom censored jill s classic outfit in re3 remake  allowed for re4 vr to get censored and put gender ideology influenced character creators in monster hunter and street fighter 6
@charming peasant  yeah Im not buying sf6
@charming peasant  just because they do some things like that doesnt mean it will ruin the entire games especially re4make. its an reimagining anyways so its different in many forms. I dont really care for them removing the ballistics line but at least capcom isn t forcing anything else. and honestly they changed claire s outfit too and no one complained about that in fact they changed all the characters  outfits including leon s.
Im still disappointed we haven t got a remake of dino crisis. but  the resident evil games are looking good.
they deliberately changing ada  so everyone can enjoy  they said this in the conference. they dont respect their fans.
I thought it was meh. the showcase showed everything we already knew about besides re4 remake gameplay and news on reverse. I was hoping they announced the mercenaries mode and the separate ways campaign that was in the original re4 in re4 remake.
@goldenotaku 79  the original is the gamecube version  and it doesnt have that retarded ada s minigame. the idea was good  but it was poorly executed. also  the gc version is way more superior than the ps2 version.
@alex dio  how is the gc version more superior when it has less content  also it is your opinion that you find the ada campaign stupid. me along with many others found it as a nice addition plus completing it gave you the legendary chicago typewriter and the mafia and knight outfit for leon and ashley. if you are going to remake a game you are going to remake the definitive edition of the game which was the ps2 port and later on the hd ports. also the ps2 version rewarded you for completing professional mode and gave you the prl 412.
if you cant be a good example  then be a terrible warning  c
I thought they were racing ign.
let s see if I can use their own arguments on them.  ahem    some people feel incredibly entitled to make a noise and take up space uninvited. it wasn t made for you ashley  and thats okay. if you dont like it  dont play it. shut up and sit down  its not your turn to speak.   gymnast ending pose doesnt feel very nice  does it kotakoid
the thing is when a character is  bland  its usually so the player can insert themselves into the role a bit  take nomad from crysis  people said he was boring but that was so the player could feel more involved in the character  if you make the character too unique  which is good in some games  the player will feel as if they are playing someone else s story  in games like re7  half-life  crysis etc  the player will actually feel like they are the person they re playing  that the character s experiences are happening to them too  it pulls the player more into the game and story and makes them feel personally involved. these games are usually 1st person games  especially ones where you never see the protagonist s face  or the protagonist doesnt speak.
I was angry about this until I realized it was from kotaku. then I laughed and wondered how long until they g4 themselves out of existence.
melonie your thoughts on family  this toxic  love yourself  generation  everything you say in this video ive been saying to people for years  its so refreshing and relieving to see someone anyone else in this generation believes in real family values and doesnt think people are disposable. you are an inspiration  listening to this video made me cry because I really didnt think anyone understood how I see the world and you said what ive been saying for years. as a single father whos ex wife is in washington state after abandoning us ive been in a very dark place and I feel alot better at least for today knowing theres someone out there who sees right and wrong in this. thank you for this content.
I ll be honest I absolutely hated ethan for the longest time but after playing through village a lot I can only hope to be half the dad he is. I dont have a lot to about james tbh because Ive only played through the game one time. but honestly I want to be a dad like ethan because I also have a daughter. all dads should be more like ethan
Jesus Christ. one thing I love about  some  japanese companies. they dont change anything when it comes to remakes like these. especially the characters.
I haven t played the new resident evil games but this journo makes ethan sound like a badass. I d loose my shit if I hand a hand chainsawed off but this dude didn t say anything.
damn  ethan went through hell in 2 games already  and now its happening in real life
just a day that ends in y.
lol  that dog s timing at the beginning was perfect
saw you on geeks and gamers finally. love seeing a good crossover. keep up the awesome work
those devoid of moral virtue have a hard time empathizing with those that have it. thats why she cannot relate to virtuous characters.
Ive been hearing a lot of people complaining about the new remake of silent hill 2 for a few days now. I dont understand why as a fan of the franchise its looks absolutely outstanding I cant wait to play it. I guess this just futher proves everyone is gonna bitch about something and just cant be exicted for a new game. I highly recommend the silent hill franchise definitely a great series to get into. great video keep up the great work.
ethan is the bravest systems engineer from california ever  who had no prior experience with weaponry  or combat at all  but managed to fight through a texas chainsaw like place in louisiana  and a cult in the middle of romania  and james sunderland fought a physical manifestation of his grief and pain to reconcile his past. two of the biggest goats ever. meanwhile at kotaku
melonie you dont have to give clicks to these people  you can use the wayback machine in order to prevent them having a click and still do your content  let them rot and go bankrupt.
these kotaku  writers  give me strong  the college jock dumped me and my backup simp refused to pay for dinner  vibes.
ah  yes  kotaku. the pinacle of game journalism  not that game journalism exists anymore on many websites
the hilarity of this article is that if these people went through any of the things ethan did  their taint and souls would have evacuated their bodies so fast and so soon they d break the sound barrier.
its crazy gamers love both of these characters. they are written so amazingly.
its clear who ever wrote this already had their mind made up just based on these characters color and sex.  many times winters was in situations that would have made most people give up but he still pushed on first for his wife and then for his daughter. hell in village he literally died for them.
hopefully soon.
amen to that. I despise this current generation even if I am a part. family plays vital role in our way of life.
james cheated on then murdered his sick wife.
@theredheadwiththread  theres no real confirmation he cheated. some people interpret certain things that way due to the symbolism but nothing ever confirmed he cheated. its just that people will say maria and some messages in the game may represent an affair he had. he did kill her and thats confirmed of course but cheating is not but its better to interpret it anyways.
@chandler burse  so he s a pretty bad person
@chandler burse  I never really got into silent hill mainly because I never knew about the series till years later into my senior year but I absolutely love resident evil  and that remake looks super fire
@theredheadwiththread  in the original he seemed pretty naive to be honest
@twitchytango  its arguable among the fanbase since at least one of the endings results in james finding some form of redemption.
@twitchytango  Ive never touched a sh game myself. only resident evil.
@chandler burse  Ive only played silent hill 2 once and downpour which is generally the most hated one. but I love almost every resident evil to date and I shamelessly love resident evil 6 for sentimental reasons but definitely super excited for re4 remake
@chandler burse  Ive also been doing a series talking about my hopes and dreams for the remake and its just fun talking about a franchise I grew up with
@theredheadwiththread  he didn t cheat and he kills her out of frustration and bc she asked. she suffered enough and gave up.
he didnt really he threw up his hand last minute to avoid getting his head sliced off with a chainsaw screamed painfully once then waited till the monster backed off to reattach his hand with some mold goop.
I believe that may be because many people including myself are disappointed that its being developed by bloober team given their history of plagiarism.  just by typing  bloober team  into the yt search bar  the top auto-completed suggestion is  bloober team plagiarism  and brings up a lot of videos with some calling them out with some valid points.  I recommend  bloober team bites  by bobvids.  thegratedebate podcast is also a good listen.  in their defense  they do make visually impressive games  but based on what Ive learned about them and seen I watched a full playthrough of  the medium   I d say thats about the extent of their ablility.
good point
@melonie mac go boom  love your content  keep up the good work!
love the content m m  keep it coming.
how messed up do you need to be to want a random character to slyvia plath himself
before I watch this  I want to say that I tried to watch the resident evil showcase yesterday because I thought  even though they were showing new stuff for the game  they understood that this new edition would bring a new audience in  Im a hardcore fan who just hasn t had the opportunity to play it yet  and basically the first thing they did in the showcase without warning was blow the end of village!! Im pretty sore about it and just want that off my chest.
best part of silent hill is meeting the space invader.  have you seen a little girl
you gotta play silent hill 2  if not playing it  maybe watch max derrat s videos about it.  james is such a solid character  one who I wish most people were like  aside from some uh..issue  but what he goes through hell until he remembers why his wife is dead.  its a sad story  but solid character design.
her calling them narcissists is like in shevhulk when jen calls the avengers narcissists then goes on to portray every stereotype of them
the situation with his hand isn t even that unrealistic. you know  adrenaline kicked in. I even witnessed this sort of situation twice.first happened long time ago when I was a little kid. one of younger boys ran into the guy from middle school. he knocked off his both front teeth with his head. the guy didn t started crying or panicking. he just calmly came to school building with blood dropping from his mouth and both teeth in his hand.the next one happened on last year of my middle school. boy from my class tripped while trying to catch a ball at p.e. class. he broke his finger to the point that you could actually see his bone. the same as the first guy  he was completely calm for an entire time.and neither of them was even an adult at the time! so this situation from game isn t even that weird.p.s sorry for any grammatical mistakes! it isn t my first language.
I haven t play silent hill 2 but I know james story and it can be seen as a redemption story both tragic and monstrous things he did.
wow this a new level of seething from kotaku.
I love how none of this was an issue just 21 years ago  oh how much we have regressed.
one of these days  these types of articles Im going to fall on death ears and we are going to back to when the  quality of the game is important instead of the skin of the   portagonistbig fan of your work melonie keep up the good work and I hope you try out  silent hill for yourself soon
the story hasn t changed. a hero needs the villain. the dragon to slay. but in our world  we re so pampered and safe  that villains have to be invented. created out of thin air. everyone else seems cool with it  and goes along with it  until the  hero  looks in your direction randomly and sees the  villain  they need.
if they actually played the game they d know that james is not portrayed as a hero or good person. I wont spoil it for people who haven t played the original  if you haven t  do it now  but james has very dark secrets that are by no means praised at all  which you find out as the game goes on
love ya melonie.  great video regarding the woke culture.  I am jealous of your dog count!
your doggo hopping into bed at the beginning was the most wholesome thing Ive seen all week
loved resident evil village btw!!!!one of my favorites!!!hope to play the new 3rd person version with the dlc due out soon!!!!visually stunning to just look at.
saw you tweet about this. figured it was right up your alley. I never played re games much because I never liked horror games either.
yay for my tweet getting shown! I wish kotaku would just shut down. Im surprised they are still around  lol.  can we just build our own off-grid community to get away from the wokies  that d be nice. there is so much projection from that  game journo  that I dont even know where to start. the entire article is just projection  racism  sexism  bigotry  etc.
and this is why game journos like those at kotaku are becoming more and more irrelevant and becoming unemployed. talk about being a bitter person writing something like that. damn.
the  I know Im spiteful  at the end truly shows us her colors.... no remorse.
its called shock alot of people who experince horrfic bodily harm go into it.its not like ethan is silent either you can hear him rapidly deep breathing afterwords he just cant speak words until he reattaches it.
you can go off grid whenever you want. why are you still wasting time complaining on the internet
of course they want to complain and latch onto two trending series and games they really love. the fact that they re complaining about the most minuscule traits about these two awesome characters. shut up kotaku! love your cutie dog melanie
everything that happens to them is kindled by their more interesting sick  missing wives. er  all the creatures and events that happens to james manifest because of his inner turmoil as what he feels are consequences for his actions. he is a severely depressed man desperately clinging onto his last strings of sanity because he has nothing left to live for.his wife was just the root of it all  but everything else that happened was because of james. if the protagonist was mary  it just would not work.
no spoilers here  this is all stuff you ll learn in the first few minutes of the game  never mind didn t realize that this article spoiled the game anyway short and sweet of it is  james gets a letter from his wife who s been dead for 3 years. he goes to silent hill because the letter said he d find her there in their special place. he feels immerse guilt about her dying in a hospital  and has been extremely depressed and potentially suicidal  why his line delivery feels so numb in the original  so he clearly cares about his wife and wants to find her again get closure of some kind.
and dont forget the time kotaku made an article against ready or not  calling it a  violent swat fantasy  and so on
these people dont operate in the real world
even without having played sh2  your tweet was right on the money.  ethan when to hell and back for the sake of his family.  james is in a hell of his own making.  totally different characters and stories.
ethan identifies himself as a blonde fungus person.
oh. my. Lord.that writer s description of james s wife s status makes my eye twitch.the dude wasn t frickin horny. he just watched the woman he loved with all his heart spiral down a terminal illness. she wasn t  sick . thats dumb and about a close to outright lie as you can get. not just a terminal illness  but one that also came with violent  wild mood swings that were often targeted at him. she was dying. slowly and painfully. and it tormented him. she tormented him. james couldn t handle it anymore and thats why he snapped. not because he was horny. he killed her to end her suffering and his. as someone who has literally watched a loved one die from a terminal illness  you dont ever call it  sick . sick is what happens when you eat bad guacamole. death is what happens when you get a terminal illness. I pray this ashley person never has to learn the difference  despite her ignorant hatred for me.  blond white guy!  his sexual frustration was only one aspect of the multitude of layers this game went through to portray  guilt  remorse  mourning  suicide  mortality and mental illness.sexualized nurse demons cause he fantasized about the nurses at his wife s hospital. which he never acted on. because he was faithful to his wife. pyramid head to represent his own dark secret.maria was a manifestation of his wife. because all james ever really wanted was to be with mary.  even the names are similar  he wanted itso badly  loved his wife so much  thatsilent hill created maria in his wife s image  then killed her in front of him  to punish him even more. like  damn.and the dude still marched onward to find his wife. until he finally remembered the truth and then  depending on your ending  he still fights on to find a path to redemption. he s not a hero. he s a flawed  mentally unstable  suicidal  tormented man that murdered his own dying wife and is now suffering through silent hill to be judged for it. and its insanely compelling. if you played silent hill 2 and came away with   he killed his sick wife and forgot because he was horny. . you so missed the point. by about a mile. or ten.
ethan was made to self insert to make the game more immersive. did she want a shakespearian tragedy every time he describe something  she sounds completely insane
to play devils advocate for ethen  part of many people s problem with him is how dull he could be in reaction to everything that happened around him. on top of that his motivation was pretty simple  though I personally find that refreshing
listen  I just wanna enjoy playing video games  have fun   escape from real world shit. savvy I ll be damned if we re gonna let these uneducated sadists of kotaku ruin it
james is a man so tormented by his own guilt about his wife thatsilent hill took notice and lured home in.
I can sorta get why someone at kotaku wouldn t like james. but I have no idea why someone would hate ethan. he s practically a meme of a character anyway. but from what I remember  he s done literally nothing wrong in either game he s in.
so  she takes any point she could have with the title and throws it out the window immediately by not even making it about the subject of video game characters  and all about her unveiled hatred.
its refreshing to hear someone talking sense
these attacks on beautiful people  which is my people  are horrible. I wish for the beautiful people  of which I am included  to be safe  and I pray for us as well.
cries there isn t enough  realism that reflects my world  in video games that are set in fictional worlds  with fictional monsters. sure  that makes sense
just the fact this  game journo  could possibly get ptsd by seeing a photo of someone like dolph lundgren makes me smile.
james sunderland  always protecting his family.
both games are made by japanese developers. to them  these two men are exotic. it is all a matter of perspective which the people at a company whose name mimic japanese naming conventions  kotaku  lack entirely.
she wanted james s wife to be the protag of sh2 and mia to be the protag of re 7 8.
yeah  I understand the complaints about his reactions  but at the same time it feels a bit more real than freaking out all the time
to be fair ethan is dead  what we play as in most of 7 and again in 8 is a mold copy of him. also I d rather quit gaming for good than have to play as characters that have an emotional meltdown over everything they come across.
Im sick of people asking for realism in games  ever heard of a word fiction
@seahawkerino  to be fair fiction without an anchor of realism is pretty shit  you might as well just make nothing but animaniacs and loony tunes at that point.
@spr1ggan - why are you shittinh on me ffs ! get lost!!!
@spr1ggan -  God leave me alone why are you tormenting me ! I could recover from a war but not from you  subhuman.
@seahawkerino  k...
I will say that james sunderland is a nightmare person but ethan winter is a g
in case you dont mention it  ashley bardhan has her tweets deleted if they are older than 7 days old - automatically. she probably uses social dog or something simple like tweetdelete.
this is probably one of the most racist things Ive ever read and Im not even white  holy mother of Jesus  how is kotaku allowed to publish this stuff is beyond me  what an awful terrible hateful site  its crazy they masquerade as  gaming journalists  when its clear they hate games  thatsite should be taken offline forever.
just started watching  amazing intro especially the lil  pup coming into frame to lay in their bed  adorable
both ethan and james were designed by japanese artists.and james is the single most interesting  complex protagonist in a video game. sh2 fans like me lol  are militantly protective of sh2 so who ever wrote that article is gonna be devoured by its fan base.also  not liking a video game character because they re  untalented  is a very weird take. like thats a valid reason to dislike  say  a  journalist  writing thought pieces no one cares about for a website fading into obscurity but for a video game character  especially in a horror game where protagonists lacking in combat ability is often a vital component to the survival horror formula.
wow  what a way to completely misunderstand james as a character. he loved his wife but as she slowly died over years of suffering he became frustrated with the whole situation. the whole point of his character is that he s not only dealing with the grief of losing his wife  but the shame of how he acted so selfishly during that latter parts of her illness. he eventually smothers her not only to end her suffering but so he can finally get on with living his own life and he hates what he s done and why. the great tragedy at the end is that his wife understands why he did what he did and completely forgives him.
hey  I been addicted to korean tv shows the last few months. they do what hollywood used to be 20 years ago. its awesome! just got to get used to the subtitles..
a lot of people dont like ethan and I dont understand why  when he gives rose to chris at the end I cried like a baby  -
what a morally  and hopefully soon financially bankrupt  site .... I hope it goes away already  they are an absolute blight on gaming  they are now stooping to casual misandry and blatant racism to click-bait  sheeeesh.
your dog is adorable. also  very pumped for the silent hill 2 remake.
ethan pulls his cooked head out of the oven  splashes it with medicine and is completely fine. ahh itstings.
they can hate us if they like. we aren t going anywhere and there s nothing that they can do about it.
I really started to like ethan after the last few re s!
ethan winters has one heck of a pain threshold. it takes guts to rip yourself off a crucifix and then death battle a bunch of vampires.
funniest part of this is both games were made by japanese people with the only white people on the team being part of the localization team. being racist to two peoples at once.
hImelonie I wanted wish u too havea wonderful weekend  for everything you do giving out your thoughts opions on these incredible videos u make.takecare melonie
this is genuinely just a disgusting article. if one of my dear friends felt this way about women  I d probably walk away from him for good.
all of these traits the writer is attributing to these characters  and men in general  she is espousing
youre so cool. glad I found this channel
can we just enjoy thatsilent hill 2 is getting a remake  please  is that to much to ask for  not every game has to be last of us part 2.
what a horrible site  calling themselves a gaming website or gaming journalists is really misleading  is clear they hate gaming with passion  also seeing them being openly racist and hateful really bothers me as a black guy  hating someone for just being blonde is not different than hating someone for just having darker skin. is just blatant racism. they dont represent me as a gamer or as a minority.
trust me the less games that are last of us part 2 the better.
@j teh main       absolutely!!! unfortunately last of us 2 has become the golden calf for games journos.
tlou2 isn t even that woke. its really not as awful as people keep saying it is. since the hype died down mostly people who enjoy the game for what it is are talking on it and it isn t a bunch of woke leftists ranting about female empowerment. neil druckmann is for sure a weird woke leftist who hinders his own creativity but clearly it didn t show too much as it could ve during part 2. legitmately there s never a point in that game I felt like I was being preached to. and its ironic people rant about that game for that idea but there s other games with more preachy scenes they fail to see which are leftist based  themselves like bioshock s very first scene nearly for example.
@jesse porter  I never even saw a pride flag in the game.
@jesse porter  what the actors and dev said outside of the game has nothing to do with the content.
@jesse porter  most of your points fail to ever prove there was much wokeness in the game to me your just listing off crap that may or may not be viable  because Ive heard nearly all of this before with neil and such and everyone says theres proof but Ive never seen it just give me the proof and stop acting like I am just defending it for no reason for Godsakes  but thats not what Imean Imeant the actual content and a pride flag isn t anything neil is a woke dude the last thing I expected was not to see some representation and a random flag you can see thats undamaged is the least of worries in current media today it doesnt even stack up to what marvel has done in their comics for the past couple years with some characters and new ideas.
@jesse porter  I am a pretty regular gamer and I enjoyed it. the gameplay is great and the story isn t that bad. and honestly the tlou1 remake is the worst one of the series  it was undeserving and unneeded it didn t do anything really new. it was 70  dollars but lacked content from the original and it didn t do anything to preserve the game so I dislike that far more than part 2 which is at least a new experience.but maybe my opinion doesnt matter  if I were to ask some crazed fanboy I guess  since I never valued tlou to be that grand of a series Imean its good and fun but its nd s best to me. and the gameplay is just a downgraded version of uncharted s its not a bad thing but I have to admit that bit of bias.
@jesse porter  I cant tell if your last statement is genuinely trying to say tlou2 is the worst game ever. thats just in general wrong its at least playable and has a lot of hardwork put into its aI  details and mechanics unlike games like ride to hell or slaughtering grounds or a lot of other things. and I thought we agreed e.t. was still the worst game ever made.
boring  is a regurgitated and typically lame  reason  for any to dislike ethan winters. its as you said  he went through hell and back for his family  his beloved wife and their baby girl  who re the world to him. not only that  but ethan accepted that he wasn t going to make it  yet still did what he did and didn t care about what happens to him  so long as mia and rose are safe. thatspeaks to me as both a man and as a future father to my own  adopted son or daughter. james sunderland is a truly complex  heartbreaking  and relatable protagonist Im certain you ll love  whenever you do play silent hill 2  the og before the remake  which is a must!  d
its really wild this time because ethan and james characters are wildly different.ethan wouldn t have __ his __ and instead he would have ___ with ___ until __ final moments.
my natural instinct is to take this as a joke.
the article itself is patently ridiculous.  ethan winters ends up in the predicaments he does because of his utter devotion to a sense of family and care extending into protection for those he cares for.  both in 7 and 8.  he also goes through development between the games  becoming competent in in melee elements due tot raining between games  leading to his ability to counter attack off a proper block.  he goes out of his way to do what he canto be a better shield for them.  and honestly the final sacrifice is telling of the character he came to be.  in the case of james...  silent hill really is a place designed to torment people for their own shortcomings or personally held guilts in many ways.  pyramid head and his treatment of the other creatures literal sexual violence  was a manifestation of james own lingering desires weighing on his mind as his wife became unable to satisfy him while she withered away from cancer understandably so of course .  the things that happen to maria a side character designed to looks just like his wife   her multiple deaths  his inadequacy with coping or being able to help  it was all meant to torture him for his own personal moments of truly wishing his wife might perish and the inevitable moment he suffocates her under a pillow.  james and ethan couldn t be further apart from one another as far as characters.   now  its been years since I played sh2 last  so my interpretation may be a bit off  but Im just throwing out a ballpark shot I hope is close enough to understand the magnitude of difference between the two characters.    edit  first time on one of your videos melonie  love the tats and the cute pup walking round in the background!!!  keep up the good work!! x3
honestly  I get why they d say ethan is boring  they never show the mans face  it gets quite frustrating  but james sunderland isn t boring  not even close
wow. ashley bardhan is quite the racist and misandrist. guess I shouldn t be surprised kotaku would be harboring someone like that.
this is on par with vice s article about wanting to play as a more compassionate hero in the resident evil 2 remake.
those are the people to which Imake sure to say  happy independence day    happy constitution day    merry Christmas    happy fathers day    happy veterans day    happy armed services day   and of course  happy columbus day .
ethan was dead the whole time thats why ethan is a badass character. through sheer willpower and love for his family he saved them even though he was technically dead already
ethan and james are worlds apart from one another and there is no comparison. since ethan travelled all the way to find mia he went through hell and back to getting mia back home safely. meanwhile james had received a letter from his wife mary to wait for her in silent hill but unbeknownst to james there is no happy ending for him as he is trapped in a neverending nightmare in which there is no escape to like there is with ethan and anyone who has played the original silent hill 2 knows the twist but since the silent hill 2 remake is fast approaching I am avoiding posting spoilers since silent hill 2 s story must be experienced first hand and I wont ruin it for the others since I love silent hill 2 so much and I would like to hear their views on their 1st playthrough. but will blooper stay faithful to the original silent hill 2 as I am sceptical to say the least but I will give their remake a chance.
at 2 40 I had to stop and get myself together lol
kotaku still exists   wow. bunch of lunatics.
he should unalive  himself.  - person who couldn t beat re village
imagine admitting to the public that you have a fear of blonde and blue-eyed men. we really are living in peaceful times.
they re creating a image that just isn t reality
kotaku and jalopnik are two of the old gawker media sites being compelled to exist by the same small group of people. they re both ghastly.
r.i.p. kotaku.
how dare they insult james this way he has so much more personality than ethan
you nailed it dude!
it had me rolling for a while.
well said  kotaku just hates any men who have morals and a heart  this hateful drivel that person wrote in that awful site just proves it.
Imean he was pretty bland by the standards of other protags in 7. 8 did expand him a bit more but even then you cant fault people for finding him uninteresting compared to leon  claire  chris and jill.
whoa whoa whoa whoa what the f    dude like I thought this was just going to be some dumb article where they come off as you know uninformed about the games they re talking about but this is like really hostile holy crap
they are angry af because the game is good
@marco genovesi  yeah seven hill two is definitely a classic normally when stuff gets that masterpiece reputation it usually cracks over time but silent hill 2 has not done this it maintains as impactful and good as when it was new Imyself did not care much for the last couple resident evil games but hey if people like them its whatever looking forward to resident evil 4 remake though thats going to be kick ass
james did more with a lead pipe than ethan did with a whole arsenal.
this article isn t even written as if they ever played either games or even understand what they are writing for or what their job is. didn t this go through an editor or approval thing  this is literally a teenage girl ranting about two boys who rejected her itsounds like.
@chandler burse   well  hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.
@chandler burse  welcome to kotaku  this is the average quality of their articles. they managed to be angry about stray  a game about a fkin cat solving puzzles.
@marco genovesi  aight
@peter janssen  this is true
how was that even allowed to be put on their website !
liking good characters is a high iq  something kotaku lacks  so its all good.
man these young writers have really been hit over the head hard with misguided indoctrination haven t they
it is astounding how men are supposed to be subjected to this kind of vitriol on a daily basis when enjoying their pastimes and hobbies. its fucking disgusting. I also dont understand what these people find so entertaining about a protagonist being from another ethnicity. its a totally selfish and self serving remark and its so messed up.
the next few months are going to take a toll on my wallet. we have God of war ragnar k  re village dlc  callisto protocol  re4 remake  hogwarts legacy  and other games to look forward to... forget broketober  its going to be wallet-draining weekend for the next seven or eight months.
ironic considering ashley is the presidents daughter in re 4
calling ethan untalented is like calling chris a beta. lol
I am so confused as to how anyone can have nothing more important to be concerned about than fictional characters. what a convenience it must be to be so unaware of actual issues.
I wouldn t call james a good family man but he is an iconic character that its more besides white dude that you control  he s actually a pretty complex character
more white male leads in video games please.I need to see myself represented in everything all the time.anything less is prejudice.
when kotaku goes bankrupt I will have a huge party
everyone  find yourselves some time to play silent hill from 1 to 4 if you didn t  or just watch a let s play   they aren t jumpscare horror  they are truly pieces of art of psychological horror
the things at kotaku hate on ethan cause no way would they re dads do that for them
great vid  and that article is just an example of how current state of feminism will rotten your brain. btw I dig the bright colored nails.
kotaku enough said
okay let s humor her point for a second because I think she also wants diversity and inclusiveness. we swap out white male ethan winters for black male ethan winters  his personality wouldn t change. capcom would still retain that he s a family man and this same idiot would be praising capcom calling them brave for crafting such a great poc character.
the silent hill franchise has been one of my favorites since ps1. while I wish they d give us a new one  Im still pretty stoked on the sh2 remaster.
reading a kotaku article   losing 1000 braincells
that angry person who wrote that article  just described his her self right there  and took it out on a videogame pixels..
you should play the silent hill 2 enhanced edition on pc. its the definitive version to play. looks gorgeous.
anytime I hear crap like that  I just picture going up to someone and saying   I love you  cuz youre black  . I imagine either a look of utter confusion or laughter from the absurdity.
their rules not ours
ofc  the main thing these people see is race.
considering how representation currently is  a blonde haired and blue eyed hero is massively underrepresented.
well boy oh boy do I have news for you if you did not watch silent hill transmision
I am glad you made a video about this because just today I saw the article recommended to me by google lol. I saw the title and I was like  what   I read it and I was like  what is the point of this   clearly this woman had nothing to write about and decided to make this crap. or simply she knew exactly what she was doing and took advantage of the situation that new content footage of future silent hill and re games were announced. with all the exciting news she was like  you know what  I wanna shit all over this fucking parade and write an article that has no point other than to stir shit up.  the timing of this article is no accident.
first
silent hill 2 will always be at the top of my best games list  I bought a ps2 the day the original game was released just to play it. while I appreciate the technology can now show more emotion in facial expressions I feel they made james a little too emo. we haven t seen the finished product yet but this might be the game that makes me buy a ps5  if I can find one.
okay.... the whole point of silent hill is that james issues are brought to life and he has to live them in a nightmare  itseems to me they never got past the nurses  or couldn t because of their own fucked up sexual issues.
damn this article is rough. fictional characters cant get a break either!!
omg  I ignored this stuff until I was blind-sided in a social situation with   youre taking away our rights.  me   Ive had like... absolutely zero political involvement since  08  because politics dont pay bills. even then I was pitching for the blues. how tf am I at all involved in whatever it is youre blaming me for   but there was a connection  Im white and male. apparently Ive been tyler durden-ing it to the voting booths  and my complete and utter apathy is an illusion.
longish I d argue that their inability to empathize has more to do with their lack of positive emotions.a sociopath is unable to empathize because they lack those feelings  dont understand them. and often dont want to understand them.based upon their misandrist ranting  I d argue that in ashley s case rather than it being a cultural issue  its instead a mental health issue.its basic common sense that if someone is in a happy relationship and their so disappeared that they d try to find them.ditto if they re a parent and their kid went missing.thats relationship 201 in my estimation. their inability to see beyond gender  skin tone and hair colour with regards to those simple truths again heavily argue against this being a cultural thing and more likely a mental health issue.is the current cultural climate exasperating this issue  good question and one that I couldn t give a definitive answer to  but it wouldn t surprise me if it did.still doesnt change the fact that in this chicken-egg equivalent  once again the mental issue  egg  comes before the cultural aspect  the chicken . as the one who laid the egg was a reptile equivalent and the egg mutated into the chicken over the generations.
james killed his wife and the town is torturing him for it  thatseems pretty boring to me.
james was a great character journey and while ethan was a bit bland in 7  capcom really upped their game with village ethan.
you are freaking awesome mel  but your cute dog distracted me lol gonna have to re-watch haha
Im not usually an advocate for this  but I wouldn t be too sad if this writer should unalive themself.
james sunderland is probably one of the most well written and human protagonists ever portrayed in a video game. his constant self doubt  reluctance to accept reality and understated character flaws is what makes him an interesting protagonist. he s literally the antithesis of the cliche of the male video game protagonist  shows real emotions and actual moral ambiguities. his entire story is pretty much the human experience condensed into a seven hour-ish game. if you have played sh2 and dont feel anything for james at the end  you lack empathy.
ethan a family man and james a suffering widow.. kotaku already hating on them for their gender and ethnicity. smh oh man  if konamI and capcom made these characters black. they would have lived up to stereotypes of the  token black guy in horror  and the-  spoiler hint below  avoid spoilers for new sh2 players  dont read on .  wife beating pension man
dude if the game isn t depressing  if james isn t depressed or sounds off like angela imma be depressed. put simply thats how the game is supposed to be I dont want an re title I want sh!!!
didn t robin williams also played a character in a movie who went to hell to get his wife  what a movie.
preach it melonie!!!
rip kotaku.
keep up the epic vids mel!
I d like to see her do what winters did lol even tho its just a game
wait wasn t eithan screaming like screaming when his hand was getting cut off in resident evil 7

thing is  you dont learn that till the very end of the game so  thats a spoiler.
@fxrrxt2x  its a game from 2001 and it had a hd remaster in 2012  and its not like it is the most famous silent hill game outside of p.t. if that is a spoiler to literally anyone  they must have either no interest in silent hill or they live under a rock
people who been bullied to much  finds too much power  chronicle  a movie from 2012   that is what they become. hateful for everyone who is better then them and using their powers to make them suffer.
yo ngl that mic boom mid sentence was clean ong
how can you hate james if you like good stories  he is a flawed but complex character.
write hit pieces on imaginary video games characters... uses the word  untalented  unironically.
ok. just a point ethan and james are not the same at all. james is one of my favorite sh characters and he is arguably not a good person. he isn t a bad person either  but for sure not ethan.
so a psycho witch steals a little girl to resurrect her own and ashley doesnt bat an eye but when a blonde white badass named darth ethan winters the mold  because he has a lightsaber on the game  saves his daughter and dies a hero then she loses her mind.yeah she s crazy  and when she said that ethan doesnt freak out when he gets his hand cut off  losing his fingers on the same hand and he also gets his heart ripped out and seeing a dead body without being phased  Imean dude he s supposed to remain calmor else he will die and ethan went through hell to save his baby and wife  and yet he gets hate  for killing the 4 Lords  where was that  I feel bad  energy for the bakers
kotaku must be desperate for  clicks  again. lol!
she is triggered because the blonde man  first two offenses  saw a dead body and did not respond by having an extensional crisis that required 6 weeks of therapy where he came out about his father touching him and his  unrelated  realization he was really a brunette black woman all along  next several offenses.  in her defense  that would make for a much more horrific gaming experience.
I wonder what they would say about henry townshend from silent hill 4 the room lol
well it is kotaku. everything they say should be ignored.
7 14mario has gone through literal hell and back to save princess peach. dying in lava  open pits  spikes  giant bullets  and who knows how many enemies...multiple times. yet somehow  in the words of anita sarkeesian  princess peach is just the ball in a game between him and bowser. in other words those who can  are oppressing those who can not  and they need to be punished for it. in short the best doctor in town can be no better than the  worst  doctor in town  which fyI  diversity hires are now making it to the medical field  so I do hope no one needs some open heart surgery done on them anytime soon because a meritocracy is a micro-aggression against black people...but killing someone due to incompetency or malpractice seems to be just fine.
have you seen the new trailer for resident evil 4 remake   it looks so good!!!I never played it.everyone says its the best re game ever!!!what s your thoughts have you played the original  the graphics for the update look incredible!!!
to the kotaku article writer  who hurt you  and were they  perhaps  a swoopy blonde-haired family man
james sunderland....ethan winters.well  they are both family people lol
and here I joked that they or polygon would flip out if ashley s  ballistics  in resident evil 4 werent toned down this time. guess I picked the wrong game.
hey  this is impressive journalism! she turned her article into a comments section!
the best response to this is no response. dont talk about outlets like these and they ll fade into obscurity. its like the media with killers. let them all fade away.
dear jebus  the level of anger and vitriol in that article are impressive... chick has some serious issues she needs to go work out  because that level of anger just eats away at you. I knew it was going to be bad when she mentioned sylvia plath  a bad poet that also had a lot of deep seeded issues and destructive tendencies  but that was something else. can we just make the writer of this article go boom instead  lol
sorry but that little dog jumping to his her bed in the background was really cute hahaha.
you would think one of the minimum requirements for gaming journalist would be to play the actual games
I dont know anyone who takes kotaku seriously.
kotaku is so woke... I dont even believe anything they say...
kotaku   -not gay   boring
whoever wrote that article obviously did not play any of those games. both characters have a lot of depth   and are very focused and driven in their goal. silent hill 2 is probably one of my favorite games of all time. this is why I never pay attention to kotaku lol. like they have to be a parody right  there is no way someone can be that ridiculous right
its nice to know I am quite literally satan to these people I have never met.edit  looking at the comments on that article  the author is like  this is meant to be taken as a sh!tpost.  if that is the case  she didn t convey it very well  especially in this day and age when there are lunatics who genuinely feel this way.
everyone  ethan  best dad   winters and james sunderland  a man redeemed for past sins and is a loving husband...kotaku and the 0.1   of the population  too white!!! too straight!!! reeeeeeeee!!!!!me  its. a. video. game.
damn  its all the way down to video games. and nice tats as well. I will look on your page to see if there is a backstory
hello this popped up in my recommended great video and straight facts
amazing video  melonie
kotaku having a normal one
these two characters are literal opposites  ethan is indeed a family man while james is a bad man  trapped in silent hill as punishment for his own anguish and guilt  bit the author saw two similar men and concluded they re stories are the same
also  its one thing to protect your family from human thieves  even maybe a bear.  massive moss fungusmonsters   nope
the whole game a silent hill 2 was about james  its a essay about his psyche
I just love how they re not even trying to sound objective news or anything they re straight up whining their opinions under the  journalism  term
love your cute dog running to bed in the background.
when something is so racist  Im not even mad at it  Im more amazed someone can actually write this and publish it
a remake of silent hill 2   additional content for re village  did this person expect the main characters to be replaced  james wasn t exactly the ideal family man  but the story was so damn good. best game in the series for me.
how s kotaku even still around
if this person genuinely cant find anything to empathize with about ethan winters  they might be a genuine sociopath.
people always hate on who what they wish they were
saying james is a bad man is a very black and white read of a very grey game
kotaku is desperate. their venture capital has run dry.
well said melonie
if it helps  silent hill is more about building tension  and less about the  jump scare.  the original silent hill 2 is a masterpiece in the video game lexicon. it pioneered many of the tropes in video games  and is incredibly well crafted. being a game from 2001  it has some problems that can be easily overlooked. however  you should think of it as closer to a novel  and less like a movie  if that makes sense.I have no idea what the remake is going to be like  but if you want to experience a different caliber of  game.  I highly recommend it. the less you know  the better going into it.full disclosure I pre-orded it back in 2001  and have bought it a few times  so I am biased.note  silent hill 2 pulled a lot of inspiration from the novel  crime   punishment.
both characters are nothing alike  one seeks a way to escape his sins and the other to save his loved so their stories are nothing
12 06  is ethan winters handsome   we never see his face  right
I dont really get how this article was even approved. its not even an article or a news report its literally just some girl s diary entry ranting about two blonde boys like they broke her heart or something. her hatred for ethan is especially odd since he even isn t a bad person remotely at least  spoiler  james killed his wife. and also james has a lot more depth despite his stoic nature which clearly some people cannot get.
yeah they are not the same chracter they are completely different from each other the dude from silent hill is a p.I that went to the place because people went missing ethan tries to save wife in resident evil 7 and in 8 its his baby daughter yeah they are both different
their more interesting wives  well I tell you what swap the roles around  the protagonist needs to be at least somewhat stoic to let the game move forward and give a sense of danger. it would be the exact same thing again
luckily everyone sees kotaku as the absolute embarrassment that it is  and hopefully dont take anything their writers take seriously.
note to the internet  fix the problems  dont hate people who look like the people who made the problems
how can people take their anger out on fictional characters in video games  are they taking their medications with alcohol
toxic masculinity from ashley also  ashley probably hasnt played any of the games lol
deacon from days gone received a lot of flak too for one reason or another but personally I thought he was relateable character and days gone was a game I still believe deserves a sequel
Im seriously getting sick of the casual racism and sexism towards white men. I dont know much about james sutherland either  never played silent hill    but I know that ethan goes through absolute hell to save his family. he definitely earned my respect in that regard  especially in re village.
I dont know what kotaku-o-a whatever. Im here for the doggo.
ethan winters is one of the most underrated character in games and that is a well know fact...Imean I remember when most people called hin boring in re7 despite having some nice lines in the game only to having their mouth shut  by hin in re8.
the author will at the same time complain why she s perpetually single. and see herself in she-hulk.
james is a tortured man  his guilt over his actions and feelings toward his sick wife have festered in his head and when he gets to silent hill the town pulls that from his subconscious and thats why the nurses are  sexy  nurses  thats why pyramid head  who started out as a creature tied directly to james  does some funny stuff during the game Im trying not spoil anything but I hope I got the point across. and ethan is a gigachad dad. he attac he protec
people still give kotaku s website web traffic  its been years since I even considered reading their journalism lol
youre awesome. thank you!
I always felt that ethan was written in such a way  combined with the first person perspective  so the player could feel like they actually are ethan. he s relatable in a lot of ways.
@icedragon1377  in re7 yeah even capcom said soo...but I like that at least for me in re7 ethan lines makes hin looks more annoyed by the whole ordeal than being  a scared  or a brave like most horror game protags.also his little arc about starting afraid of jack to outright mock hin in his monster form that is getting boring jack  is great.
@lolboy kekman  I know  its great how he seems to get more pissed than anything else lol
I bet that writers favorite characters this year were the saints row 2022 crew lol
we can only hope they go the way of g4tv.
I think someone heard someone else say  dive in  and thought it was cool  and is now resolute to use it at every chance possible.
ethan winters arc is basically a carbon copy of  silent hill 1 3 arc xddd  capcom tends to do this a lot.
damn..  do I have to stop shopping at l.l. bean now
they let woke in and like a parasite they took over and kicked every competent person out. than they feast until its death and moves onto next business
ethan is boring. but thats on purpose. I dont remember where I read that he was  stripped  of personality because it was a first person game  so you should feel it was happening to you. which is hard is you  the character  has a lot of personality
remember when kotaku actually used to report on and review games  how the mighty have fallen. while they continue to spout this crap instead of quality content its only a matter of time before they re in financial trouble  if they aren t already
you haven t played silent hill 2   .... woah!  you are in for a treat.
cant wait for re7 dlc  re4  and the new silent hill games!
bro james sunderland litterly my favourite protagonist
I did think ethan was a little bland  but the dude grew a massive pair of balls and rose to the situation and james was a bit of an ass  but he literally paid for it by going to hell     so just hating them becuse they re blonde itsays more about who wrote the articule than the characters really.
james sutherland isn t a boring character  I would say he is more popular then ethan is aswell  though ethan is a good new character  kotaku just takes garbage ideas for an article and runs with it without knowing anything at all about source material they write about. at first james might seem boring.. but through playthoughs  especially multiple ones to get full story stuff... he is far from boring. the start of sh2 kinda slow but it picks up. anyway  yeah kookoo-taku dont know anything about actual games.
tall  blond  straight  Christian  single  white man over here... feeling very included right now. anyway... since halloween is almost here  and seems Im almost always the villain  boo!
ah yes kotaku.....they still have an audience
how tf do these people get jobs as gaming journalists in the first place
my thing is these japanese developers publishers always make their main characters white. the character is only japanese if he s in japan for the most part and Ive never seen a japanese made game where the main character is black  ever. capcom and konamI have been making games for 40 years now with hundreds of main characters under their names.is that normal and just the way itshould be or is there a good cuase to ask for something different every once in a while
I dont think she knows how insufferable she really is. she just heard this stuff in college and then proceeds to copy and paste her consciousness onto the world at large. also  trying to solve racism with racism doesnt really work too well.
exactly what I thought about this article lol.
7 02 lol now I havent played re village but I have played sh2 and I really would like to hear from these people by what sense of the imagination james  wife is interesting as a character. smh
people should make whatever characters they want. if they are only making female characters or different races to simply check a box and that isn t what they were organically going to create  then they shouldn t.
aww somebody got her little heart broken by a blonde fella
c mon  any real silent hill fan knows that james didn t kill his wife at all. the dog did!
silent hill 2 is a masterpiece. one of the greatest games ever. play it
you heard it here first folks.  in an unhinged cry for the death of your companions and man s best friend  melonie mac ends her vitriol with a shout of  dogs everywhere go boom!  p
ironically this woman says men are narcissists and get away with things  despite her being a massive narcissist and getting away with that terrible article.
ethan is literaly black mold you cant get more diverce than that
if you haven t played silent hill 2 yet  play it before the remake comes out  you dont know if it ll be good and you might get the wrong impression of silent hill 2. it is best to play the pc version with the enhanced edition patch  itshould be the easiest to get.
the old manhunt game if you want to try a really good horror-ish game. or the suffering.
ethan winters is the same as james sunderland from silent hill 2. wrong! ethan winters is the same as harry mason from silent hill 1shows what ashley bardhan knows.
I love how disturbingly flawed james is. these two characters couldn t be more different  so I have no idea what this author wants.
Im guessing this article is in response to resident evil 4 and silent hill 2 having remakes
and if everyone here played both games ethan and james are not the samethey are completely different more like two sides of a coin different ethan was more considerate of his wife than his own self being while james was more considered of his own emotions that ate him
dont tell this writer about how siphilis came from the new world  their head might explode.
the fact that the writer admitted thatshe only wrote this for clicks and just wants money proves they aren t real journalists
I wonder what ashley bardhan s relationship with her  their   father is like
not to mention ethan was molded once he got hit by jack so the theory goes
the only game character players enjoy killing them over and over is abby from tlou2.
today I learned that albert wesker wasn t evil because of his actions but because he was a white  blond and male. fun  w
james sunderland is the opposite of ethan winters.
it breaks my heart that they think james whole motivation for killing his wife was cause he was horny. there is so much depth and sadness and complexity within silent hill 2 to shove james into a shallow box is awful. that game was too much of an emotional heartbreaking rollercoaster for anyone who s actually played or even seen like a playthrough or something to come out with that conclusion.
wow  the daddy issues on display in that article.
as a blue eyed blonde male Im happy to say. Ive created two more blue eyed blonde haired children  and my wife s name is ashley.
oh hey  let s make fun of men who experienced horrific loss and are depressed and mourning that loss and desperately trying to process it. love all the empathy these people have. Imean  those two guys are fictional  but its not like there s been an epidemic of boys and men permanently flipping the off switch irl right now  right
silent hill needs vr.
bruh  love the new ethan winters cant wait for 3rd person mode gonna be so good. but back on track my man went thru hell n back.twice!!!! re7 n 8  all this hate hellx2 wasnt good enough for them
this is their only tactic  spread hate for clickbait. they have nothing insightful to say about games. they probably dont even play games or enjoy the ones they do play.
weren t these games made in japan  I would assume the reason these men are blonde is because the producers wanted to represent western men  so they gave them blonde hair and blue eyes  something you dont see in east asia
ashley is just pissed because no man would ever fight  let alone risk their life  for someone as toxic as herself.
does anyone else feel like these game journos just had fathers who worked too hard but missed just 1 too many band concert or school play.
women never get to shy away from gore.  I wonder what the worst thing she s ever endured was. definitely nothing even close to ethan  but thats most people. maybe when she got a mean tweet from that white blond male gamer daring to disagree with her stance that white men should all die. worst day of her life  the horror.
wait until these journalists find about jill valentine.
the game and re 4 remake both look really fun more hyped for re 4 remake since I played the original back in the 2000s on ps2.
I went and checked the article itself so I guess they got their first click from me in years 100  honesty here  they showed us who they are years ago .silent hill 2 is one of my favorite games of all time.  I know they re trying  poorly  to be funny  but they really misrepresented the story.  you said you haven t played the game and you might at some point so I wont get too detailed  but I ll just say james isn t in silent hill because he s worked up  nor is that the reason he forgets certain things.  the story isn t shakespeare  but its much deeper than that.
tbh  I think I read somewhere that ethan character was inspired by james...
kotaku sounds like superior journalism to me.horniness  dude what
probably the reason the writer cant empathize with the characters is because they have no empathy.
having a diatribe about Christopher columbus in an article about two horror-game protagonists was about as effective as columbus s journey to the indies itself  horribly navigated and falling face-first into coping territory.what the article boils down to is  tell me you haven t played the games without tell me you haven t played the games finally  if ethan and james were instead  women   bet you  1-million dollars the article author would be singing praises from here to the coast about how  amazing  they are.
I didn t know that woke people play horror games since they get so easily traumatized. a woke horror game character would just sit in the corner crying for hours.
well  this is like  a thing!
its very telling that they re triggered by  a man protecting his family . makes you wonder what their long-term plans are for the rest of us.
no it was not representation its geography both the games are set in the states so they went with designes that are common in the states
they d probably fight to get away from her
@allennium falcon   that alternate version of resi7 where ethan gets the mystery email to come get his lost wife... and immediately deletes thatshit!
@silverblade357  lmao
you dont have to wonder when they lay it all out in front of you daily. itstill baffles me how there are still some people who chose to ignore all the evidence and pretend this is all made in good faith.
I wish every site like that had a mandatory comment section.
I just love how these females always blame the wealthy and or handsome older man for having a young gf or wife  but never once call out the woman for being with these men!  as they say  it takes two tango!
Ive played every re in the last 26 years. Ive played 0 sh in the last 23 years.
I get the feeling that this so called gaming journalist has never played those games.
sayng that the protagonist of silent hill 2 is a family man... spoilers  no  hes not.lets say that he deserves to be in silent hill.
did they just call james boring
its the ultimate manly thing to do.  let me adjust that  its the ultimate humane thing to do. seriously  I dont think these people will ever understand how it feels to fight for your loved ones  regardless of gender. sure ethan and james exemplify extreme examples but who couldn t relate to that  seriously  let s look... uncharted 4   nate s journey to help redeem his brother. rdr1   john marston is doing it for his family.  God of war   journey to fulfill his dead wife s last wish.
I been left kotaku  used to be a good place to get gaming news and reviews not politics
your dog is super cute in the background  can we get a dog cam
I feel sorry for people who have no clue what it is to be traumatized by an event that they do not have time to mourn because to do so could get them killed. this is what games like these are about. you are thrust into events beyond your control and you have to not only fight for yourself  but for others you love and care about. where you have to do to things you would not normally do.this ashley person would not survive  10 minutes if she was thrust into situations like these games put people in. maybe instead of criticizing the game because it is not as she thinks itshould be. she should just play the games and enjoy the adventure or better yet do her own game the way she thinks itshould be and let others play it and then criticize it like she just criticized these two games.
this girl is cool af
hImelonie have you heard of the shenmue games there s a really good anime based on them on crunchy roll
I dont think james sutherland is a  family man  lmao  there is a reason silent hill torment him
peak masculinity is protecting his family wife  hmmm... laughs in divorce court.
so she wrote  we reward men like leonardo dicaprio with 24 year old girlfriends  like thats fine so those women have no choice in the matter  we elected a committee to find a random 24 year old woman and just handed her over to leo  right  no personal choice involved. maybe ashley hates women more than men and thats saying a lot.
james sunderland is protagonist
kotaku  like every gaming publications  always projecting their prejudices. remember when they and most gaming outlets said last of us 2 was better than ghost of tsushima  despite the fact that the latter was almost never available on store shelves because it kept selling out.
I guarantee you  this article couldn t be written on characters like ellen from I have no mouth and Imust scream.but..you know what  I have to credit the author for uniting my fellow gamers of all races against this shit. I think thats the silver lining.maybe we should send her body pillows of jamee and ethan in protest
these people should not be writing articles.they should be looking for mental help.
Christopher columbus was said to have white hair by the time he was 30  according to his son  so Im not sure there could be a Christopher columbus related ancestral fear of blondes.  itshould be a fear of white-haired people  if anything.
appreciate your support towards my channel 
Im black and Im from ct. you haven t experienced irony until you ve had a twenty something white girl  lecture you about racism. and inform you how should feel about something she will never experience a day in her life.
as soon as I saw the trailer for sh2 remake  I knew thatsomeone  somewhere  would try to make an issue about it. but they are bad mouthing one of the most beloved stories of all time. the person who wrote this article  looks like a complete fool  for many reasons.
the crazy ranting of video game bloggers is just sad.
can we get a phenotype check on this ashley bardhan
that is what I noticed  if it is about family and the male role  then the wokeism religion and the leftists despise it.  the break up songs are the thing  such as tainted love  soft cell   and dont you want me  human league   where it is all about the fantasy.
they say this shit because they know that youtubers making videos about them are the only people reading their articles.
its great I stopped reading kotaku long years ago. thanks for reminding me why  I see it has got even worse.I guess eventually they wil finally crash and burn. cant wait!
prejudice is judging somebody because of their  physical characteristics and ignoring who they are as a person  kotaku is pretty prejudice.
I ll keep watching brad pitt and sharon stone films.
the author claims this was a shitpost  I d argue thats the case with everything on joktaku though
when ever I see these  gaming  articles I just cant help but sigh  they re pretty much as clickbait as they can get Im looking at you gamingBible.
the author is not really hating the fact that they are white and blond  ethan is not exactly blond  the author seems to be liking leon from re2 re4 and since re4 remake was announced most likely this person is upset it may have competition
you know  ashly  there once was a person who also really  really hated a particular group of people. and that person also wrote a hate-filled book on the people he hated. he was also allowed to have his extreme hate-filled ideals and celebrated for it.blind haterade  racism  sexism  etc should never be encouraged or acceptable in any shape or form. learn from humanity s mistakes and dont repeat them in reverse.
I will add another horror   jump scare game to your list   dead space
the puppy walking around in the first few seconds was intentional. come on  admit it!
and this folks is because there are so many people out there that have way more than they deserve and therefore they do not know what is precious and they never will-they are self-centered and ungrateful to the core-this type of person is not your friend but more akin to your enemy-they are in the majority and the majority is weak-
your dogie is adorable!
a lot of people call ethan boring  and I have said this for a long time now  at least since village  ethan winters is my favorite resident evil character. him and leon kennedy. saying ethan is your favorite character or even one of the better characters is an unpopular opinion
two words  dead space.
when did gaming journalism transition from writing articles about games to using them as a pretext for a therapy session

most gaming articles back in the early 2000s features better content ranging from game strategies to tournament related stuffs. but now almost every article is written in this clickbait manner  I guess its because their websites are dying so they resort to this just to generate site traffic
damn I cant play silent hill because my hair is brown I cant identify with a blonde!!! lmfao
ethan winters is the goat
btw...is it me or does the new rendition of james sunderland look a bit like ted raimi
ethan winters a narcissist!  he s the most altruistic hero we ve seen in a long time. these people are completely delusional.
sorry for not including this in my first comment  but I have a question.  can a hate crime be reported internationaly  because I live in poland and still seriously am considering doing so
people at kotaku make arguments like   if you always make minorities the villians  then that conditions people to hate on those minorities.   yet they never seem to use thatsame logic on straight white men   apparently the conditioning only works one way.
someone should remind ashley that both of these games were created by japanese people  including women
kotaku  hating on straight white men since we got caught sniffing zoe quinns farts
family men who are protecting their families  - youreally haven t played sh2 have you  haha  not laughing at you mel  its just funny how different the storyline goes from that description. its one of the darkest games Ive played. cautiously optimistic about the remake and other things showcased. kotaku being out of touch as per usual. who cares what their race is  least important thing about any character in a game
spoiler warninghey kotaku  you hate james and want him to die... guess what  there is an ending for that.  look at the knife and dont heal yourself till you need to. one of the endings is james is suicidal and kills himself by driving into the lake.
I dont know  this article almost sounds like it was written by a machine. its all over the place. dont they have ais that can write  news  articles now  thats what this feels like
thankfully nobody reads kotaku.
the kotaku person who wrote this  just got ghosted by chad last night. so they are salty af.I am not even a fan of those characters  I dont know who they are or what the games they are in are.
thats literally like saying torque from the suffering is a boring protagonist just cause hes trynna avenge his dead family in the suffering but because he s black but most likely cause no one remembers this game lmao that no one will talk about that
I know u wont see this so ur beautiful. ur mind  ur personality  ur face  hair  and style. truly gorgeous. keep being u.
james sunderland is a deeply scarred individual. I would hardly call him boring. but of course  boring  is only code for white.
trust me  james is not like ethan at all. whoever wrote that article looked at the superficial similarities between two horror games in the same  genre  and thought  yeah this makes sense .they aren t here to play games. they are here to create absurd articles designed to waste your time. literal nonsense.
james sunderland  a family man.
calling james a boring protagonist just shows me that they have never played silent hill 2. the true ending had me in tears 20 years ago. honestly  how village ends made me tear up as well. Im convinced people thatsay things like this really dont feel anything and are just trying to drum up controversy. I appreciate you trying to call them out but  this kind of ignorance of the art form should be ignored entirely. this creates an insanely stupid conversation about what main protagonists in video games should be  when they in reality  can be anything. they gave batgirl a camel toe. 9 10
kotaku is still business
bahaha yeah I cant speak on silent hill
@melonie mac go boom  no worries  the remake will be a great opportunity to see what its all about! I think you ll probably like it  there s nothing quite like silent hill
Im starting to go less and less on kotaku because of how trashy it has gotten over the years. Imiss mike fahey
james sunderland is a man weighed down by an extreme guilt and delusion because of his actions. the plots of the two games are so different that it isn t even apples to oranges  more like apples to a renaissance painting. not to down play re8 s storyline. I just wouldn t even compare the two.
lots of industries are doing this
ah I see kotaku trying to stay relevant. you defiantly need to play sh though.
Imean leonardo de caprio is just being pragamatic  as he cannot trust the women he come across  even if he did  then there the whole family court thing  guilty until proven otherwise .
the most hilarious part about this is thatsilent hill is made in japan  by konamI  a japanese company. meanwhile resident evil is also made in japan  by capcom  another japanese company. they re mad that asian people decided to have white male protagonists in their games.... and this is supposed to be racist
sound like people more interested in representation than good storytelling and great characters. their loss. amazing characters  both of them. silent hill will always be the g.o.a.t. though lol.
japanese game companies  lets make our hero handsome blonde men thrust into a situation and fight against all odds to save the women they love.liberal white women in the west  how dare you.
Im surprised they didn t go after harry mason  henry townshend  travis grady  alex shepherd and murphy pendleton as well. the whole point in most silent hill games is that youre supposed to be just a regular looking  every man  type of guy.the reason the characters tend to not be asian is because the fictional silent hill is supposed to be located in west virginia in the united states.and maybe its usually a white person because most of the silent hill games are extremely dark and its really difficult to even see the characters features in most moments of the game  from a technical standpoint. although  there have been african-american characters in silent hill games.
bruh. im disturbed by the fact the writer is more concerned about james  looks rather the gameplay or how the trailer was
this has projection written all over it. there s just so much to unpack if youreally go into it. I d be willing to bet daddy issues for sure  why else would someone be so perpetually offended at a father trying to rescue his daughter regardless of race in a video game no less  I d also be willing to bet she s been rejected over and over by white guys thatshe was attracted to and fawned over but was rejected  hard. probably in high school college. regardless  this person has issues  and they really shouldn t be listened to at all.
I hope kotaku goes the way of g4tv. it has been a hot mess of piss poor  journalism    if you can call it that  for years with a complete single sided agenda and is horrible for the gaming industry.
people still read kotaku article  pikachu shocking face.
whew.. these articles are spiteful as hell.. like they re workin through personal trauma in real time. ethan and james are such good characters for a couple different reasons  but james specifically was a vehicle for such a fascinating dive into the monster any of us could become under the right circumstance. like.. imagine trying to relay a deeply human message like that with some bombastic fantastical protag.. fuckin ridiculous. these ppl are so inept when it comes to dissecting art  its astounding.
wow james sunderland s wife had some disease and he became sexually frustrated due to his circumstances not an excuse but it a natural reaction to not getting any sex from a woman you love. it manifested itself in horrible horrific ways in the town of silent hill. itsuper deep and psychological
as a straight white male these articles dont really bother me. I just remember that the people writing them are some of the most unhappy  unfulfilled people on the planet.
I need to find a melanie mack of my own
the truly irritating thing here is that ashley clearly thinks she s funny too.
they just want everyone to be a bunch of pats
james is the exact opposite of ethan winters. ethan went out of his way to save his wife while james . did a bad.james is not a family man other than adopting laura at the end.
preach
thats not really the entirety of james  journey and character. I think the fandom is kind of a bit overblowing it with  everything in sh2 is due to james being a horny boy
its really stupid to criticize these characters for their wives being the most interesting things about them and none the less these men being the protagonists  considering the writer of silent hill 2 perfectly described it as such that james in sh2 may be teh protagonist  but the main character is not him but his wife and her manifestation  mary maria . complaining about them being the protagonist ignores the fact that the protagonist is not the main character  and the writer of sh2 perfectly understod that -- the writer of this article does not.
she didn t get away with it... she got paid for it.
so in the future Im gonna be hated for loving and supporting my wife  feeding our children  taking them to school  and paying child support because Im a man
im a senior citizen that has been gaming since before we were called gamers  just nerds  and if you check into the histories of the greater majority of  gaming journos  applied to many  journalism jobs and failed before landing a job in gaming. which means they are not gamers and do not represent us  and in many cases around 2000 to 2005 a lot of them came from fashion magazines that were in a collapse just as there was a need for this newfangled thing called gaming.
japanese and eastern european editors and developers dont mind at all what those journalists think. the only time I recall tecmo being bothered was releasing dead or alive xtreme 3 only in eastern china because they did not want any controversy with feminists. yet you could purchase a fully working ps4 version from hong kong and still play it in english. only the consumer will be bothered by those media. thank God I live in europe 1nd dont have to think about what you are describing. at least as much...
I guess they dont want my white  blue-eyed dollars
ethan surely is a family man  but james  well... I wont spoil anything for you  but neither of them is nowhere near  boring   they re both fascinating characters in their own way  as a matter of fact  they re both way more intresting than  for example  aloy  from the horizon series  and I like the horizon series a lot  even tho aloy is utterly generic  I dont give a rat s ass if the protagonist is a male or female  for example  my top 5 favorite protagonists in all of fictional media not only videogames  but also series  movies  etc  is number one senua hellblade  senua s sacrifice   number two arthur morgan red dead redemption 2   number three guts berserk  even tho I dislike 99 9999  of mangas animes   number four sarah connor one of the ogs strong female leads from a different era that didn t felt forced down our throats and she was badass  and number five white fang white fang by jack london  so what if he s a wolfdog  he s still the protagonist
this is true they hate me because im atractive
Im sorry  james sunderland is a boring protagonist  they clearly haven t seen the toilet scene. for realsies  though  ashley is either playing it up for shock   awe  y know  the kinda folks who pat themselves on the back for pissing off the  right people   or is in serious need of professional help to sort through their own rampant psychological issues. maybe sh2 just hits a little too close to home for her
ashley tweeted that this was a trolling shit post.  you cantell  because its so over-the-top.  the problem is  kotaku and polygon post shitty articles that are so close to this  you cant tell whether they are being serious  or just shit posting.  the best thing you can do is to not read their articles!  these magazines are just struggling for relevancy.  they ve been supplanted by youtube and twitch reviews  and are trying to survive.
so they re saying I should play the games.
can game journos understand that these games are developed in japan  and they are immune to  america s wokeness.  these games are developed primarily by japanese devs. sure  sh2 remake is developed by a polish team  that uses a template and characters created by . you guessed it  japanese people.
kotaku  does itstill exist  wasn t the sht sued out off the whole media group
what is wrong with people  both of the characters have completely different personalities. it is subjective if someone likes one  the other and none of them. ethan has a character arc with being the protagonist of two games and they really pushed his character during re8  james was in only silent hill 2 of the main series. the guys of sh 1  2 and 4 were pretty silent  self inverted and confused. why do people always complain about everything   just be happy to get new games with characters that look close to their originals. re8 even gets a third person version this week  think that is a nice upgrade for people that love games the more cinematic style. cutie  if you have not played this games  just do it for yourself and dont listen to people that love to talk down on everything. your own opinion is the best in the end.
this feels like reading an edgy 14 year old s diary. full of cringe and you get the feeling he thought he was cool  original and smart when writing it.
I a  so glad the quartering  brought me hear. just subscribed today
please play silent hill you wont regret it. all time classic game
Imean whats really intresring is that both games are coming out of studios from japan.
yup someone who clearly has no character reviewing characters. I fear its not media whom have jumped the shark  its people in general. a lot of them like ashley. moral of the story  dont be ashley .
this is why I dont trust most game journalists and only listen to youtubers who actually played the game. as for why they care about james and ethan being white men is beyond me. they re literally just characters that happen to be white and men  it ain t that deep. freaking drama queens I swear.
great point
reads her articlenice ... let s see her relationship with her father.
I like ethan.  every white man is not the same.  God  I hate generalizations.
well I understand for james sunderland but why ethan
calling james sunderland an uninteresting character is the most ignorant statement in gaming history.
well  well... kotaku writer being misandrist and racist at the same time.
miss the verse of the day mel.
the breakdown of society is relevant to most things that we have critiques with in culture. nietzsche predicted that humanity would fall away from religion all together  and jung lamented that we as a people would be materially rich and spiritually poor. that is the current reality we live in the us  a currently Godlessly ruled culture that has found novelty only in material possessions and can no longer empathize with the values that once made it.where other cultures like latin america have held onto certain cultural ideas  america has fallen prey to nihilism and is more susceptible to a loss of morality and care for culture all together. rather the current culture lashes out at the history that made the nation and society as a whole because it can no longer tolerate or find novelty  a false idea of meaning  in it.
you almost sound turned on discussing ethan s manly peak
I thought once that we should let woke people have their own country just as an experiment. then I realized that we already have that in california  illinois  and new york and people are leaving those states right and left. woke theology fails because its discriminatory and is built on a foundation of logical fallacies. this kind of thing is just one more thing that proves that.
play sh2 its incredible.
sorry for being blonde  on my way rn to die my hair pink and start calling myself they them
james and ethan are supposed to be kind of boring. they re representative of the every man. way to miss the point kotaku.
this is what happens when you put megaphones in the hands of a bunch of broken people with severe mental issues.
this woman is absolutely insane and if I had to go out on a limb Im going to say this woman is bitter because no dudes want to date her. Im sure if leonardo dicaprio showed her any sort of attention she would ride that man into next week without a second thought. she has clearly never played either of these games. first off silent hill 2 is one of the greatest games ever made even outside of the horror genre. my guess is she saw a picture of james and then watched a 30 second synopsis of the game then wrote this pos article. second re 7 has a whole section where you play as ethan s wife who is a trained military agent btw. so her evaluation of this game is completely from a place of ignorance too. these people are an absolute disgrace. melonie please play sh2 and do a review of it I would love to hear your take on it.
just checked out the reviewers comments and she is simping over leon so technically we got the case of resident evil 4 remake beats everything else mindset a lot of people are currently hating sh2 remake because they prefer re4 remake and dont want the spotlight off of it but this thinking is really stupid because both games are great and we should have both instead of getting rid of one for the support of the other kinda greedy thinking lol
gaming jernos are basicly the buzz feed of jernos.  d
its good to see someone not hating white men.
ashley bardhan had 1 job.... and s he handled it worse than konamI or 343 studios....honestly if you had this 1 job... I would have given credit to the studio that tasked you on this. thanks for taking a giant dump on the living fan-base that would have paid for this game. at least resident evil 2 lived up to its namesake!
I doubt she  the writer of the artical  actually even played the games she was talking about just read a summary. of the games
wow  okay  I guess the wokes are right  the racism is real.  I dont know how exactly european culture turned into the villain in the english-speaking world. it would make sense if that was not the culture all of us were writing for. even the japanese who make these games were trying to appeal to western audiences  which is something writers in the west could really take a hint about  especially considering their recent output in the realm of games and television.   I could think of numerous atrocities committed across seven continents  or five at least  but somehow Im still grateful for mcdonald s and the internet.  oh  and let us not forget such other contributions such as human rights  democracy  computers  modern history  and the entire english language.     r.g.
loud keyboard noises
opens twitter
some re4 fans are upset with the current silent hill revealing because it had a better representation stream but they all agreed its good to have both games
tds breaks people in all sorts ways lol
this is a little sad. I used to really enjoy kotaku years ago. it used to be fun. then it got mean  attacking starwars fans. itstopped being fun  so I left. itseems to exist only for youtubers to make content from their bad takes.
I really dont know why anyone still reads kotaku.
woke religion  Im stealing that. what the f is going on rn
I guees  I see  where all the hate against that  new  3rd perspective ethan really comes from.seeing ethan for the first time was a disappointment even for me - and Im a white  straight guy. he just doesnt cut it for me. he does not seem believable. one just cannot put faith in him to do what he will be able to achieve and overcome throughout the game.we all are used to and await videogames superheroes protagonists being good looking strong men a.k.a. chads  e.g. chris redfield  leon kennedy etc.   but not being a guy next door.the problem with ethan winters isn t white men - its the inappropriate type of protagonist - capcom wanted ethan to be a median white guy next door type for more of their main customer demographic which is such guys to identify themselves with  but they failed big time  due to the fact  that even this being true  people dont want to identify themselves with...  themselves  - being as mediocre as the protagonist of a game  which mostly are superheroes instead.itsimply doesnt compute  because if they were superheroes  they would ve had no spare time playing videogames. its fun to see henry cavill a.k.a. literally superman himself being a bruh  playing a videogame  but it doesnt work the other way around. you wouldn t watch a movie  where superman is been played by a weak mediocre looking spaghettI arms red head geek a.k.a. conan o brien type.
youre so pretty! also  kotaku are so woke.
ethan did kinda suck. basically just a player stand in. wouldn t be as bad if the series didn t have some of the greatest playable protagonist of all time  chris  jill  claire and leon. this article definitely takes the hate too far though
imagine the sheer hubris to insult columbus  who sailed halfway around the world in an age of primeval medicine with the most basic of instruments and virtually no one else s experience to guide him. unabashed hubris.
I wonder if they hate on cavill too
it doesnt even make sense as they re nothing alike. ethan isn t that deep of a character he s just a functional protagonist with basic motivation  but james  his entire psyche is trying to kill you  he s in mourning for his wife  and guilt ridden over how he feels about her illness and death.kotaku is just trash. what do they want  an award for being commercialized gawker runoff that managed to have some worth to be sold to pay off hulk hogan
I want to pet the doggies.
I love how mental health and suicidal tendencies are super important! unless its a white man suffering
someone make this  journalist  play through devil may cry games. they have not one  not two  but three hadsome white blond protagonists at the same time  and one handsome white brunette as well . she would surely go nuts ahahaha. thats why I love japanese game devs  they dont give a f ck
hahaha ashley is seething
considering what james sunderland does  or rather did trying not to spoil too much  Im surprised they haven t tried to make the case thatsh2 glorifies femicide
kotaku is doing its schtick again.  rage baiting for clicks
I do find ethan and james very boring when it comes to their personality.  what they experience and what they are capable of are their only interesting aspects.  and I leave it at that.  no need to get all racist!  and what the article writer says regarding Christopher columbus and seemingly hating males with euro-ancestry  that type of rhetoric can be used for various horrible people of every other ethnicity phenotype as well as women and hate everybody from there.  I honestly hope the writer stays away from young boys  ashley could end up on the news cause of it.  not even trying to joke.
the article is absolute thrash. ethan may not be the best re protagonist and he has some lame lines and reactions in re8 although they mybe explained away by the final revelations in the  game. and what he does in the end is very brave. james well yeah  he has done a terrible thing  and I find him a good protagonist. I bet this  urinalist  wanted them to turn james into a transwoman of color for the remake to make him more interesting. anyway kotaku is irrelevant  I highly doubt any real gamer reads kotaku for gaming news.
damn these... japanese developers imposing their whiteness upon us!
this woman is saying that ethan is a narcissist while complaining about how these games aren t tailored to her tastes. its wild how so many of these wokes claim to be so called  empaths  yet absolutely refuse to understand anything that they cant directly relate to. she talks about how ethan is bland and uninteresting yet he s written that way intentionally in 7. like link  he s supposed to be an avatar. the man has no face. lol. I dont think this ashley even played village as ethan definitely stepped up in that game. I bet ashley text this whole article to her editor from her toilet where such a useless topic probably popped into her mind.
idk  I enjoyed ethan as a character. to each their own
Ive found as much as they talk about empathy and such they are functionally incapable of it. which is why they treat basic humanity like a super power.
what  would they want james to be poc and be a  spoiler a wife killer  yeah he kills his wife. in majority of endings.
well  ethan was the worst re protagonist  for me  until they give some personality in village  but all their arguments go down  the toilet when the words  blonde white man  came out of their mouths.
the sheer level of unmitigated hatred makes me believe the writer is a misandrist  or a racist. maybe both.
just reminder that they write this articles because that makes you click on them. so dont google their site.
reminder its ok to be white  straight and male. let s also remember that the vast majority of gamers are white. how about instead of more black characters  hispanic  asian  indian american or native american  talk about under representation. kotaku and polygon  the soy gaming sites of the internet.
they are trying to create something that does not exist
isn t it great that racism is a one way street  as a white man I think its just awesome I can be run into the ground across the board for something as basic as aesthetics
I find it funny that whenever people gonna use colombus as a reference they for some reason unaware what time period he lived in and was from. was the natives even better when it came to slaves  butchering of innocent people  back than everyone was involved in slavery and everyone pretty much slaughtered their neighbors if they could. yet for some reason an era thats about 5-600 years ago for some reason are comparable with modern era. it is simply not. just the attitude and awareness towards race and gender is less than 50 years.
this is what you get when race and sex are character traits
only ignorant people allow the media to dictate how they live their lives and teach them to be such ignorant little bigots-those are the truly weak people!any of you that disagree with this might want to look in the mirror and ask yourself  what I stand up and fight for somebody that I loved   or  would I continue to allow the masses to dictate my way of life and change my beliefs
wow thats some crazy shit written in that article. the only thing I can agree with is that ethan winter s is kind of boring lol. played through resident evil village myself and yeah I kinda think his dialogue could use some work
ethan winters  a man who fights through a village of monsters to save his daughter that keeps fighting after having his heart literally crushed and giving his life to save his child.james sunderland  severely messed up in the head  did something horrible due to a severely declining mental state and repressed urges  who secretly desires being punished for the things he did and has suicidal tendencies but still goes through absolute hell to find the truth.yes  very boring  boiling down to race isn t racist at all. to call james sunderland boring and evil is completely misinterpreting his character  either that or they haven t played silent hill 2.
why all this white man hate  they re awesome! witty humor  can-do attitude and great art planning. conversations are pretty awesome as well.I would like to thank them for the printing press  the aqueducts  the plane  the internet and white chicks they created nfl  nba. hell  without golf  would there be a famous tiger woods  didn t a white man grab mike tyson from the streets and make him a living legend   odd it was don king and two black chicks that brought him low . can you imagine no tom cruise or robert redford or brad pitt  why hate on white men  based on my life as a black dude from south chicago  based on the rules these people set  I should hate black men. right  maybe I do. all my black friends are related to me. I dont trust the rest
cant wait for silent hill 2 remake
I personally think ethan and mia winters are amongst the most boring resident evil characters. I wouldn t go as far as to have a huff over it though! Ive still got a whole roster of awesome re characters to enjoy  after all.
whoever the writer is  something tells me she is the type of person to turn straight guys gay and lesbians straight within nano-seconds upon meeting her.
Im not fully sold on the hype.the remake looks like a dark anthology game. the sh f should ve been a siren blood curse game but sh ip is well received than siren. for someone that played the games since ps1  it really is way off and for a fan you know. they also stated  they re catering to the modern audiences  that alone is a sign of red flag  I didn t say western politics but the way it feels really is like the evil dead remake.the remake is probably good  altho its bluuber but the new one is not sh no matter how great and famous the writer is.having the og creative as credit is like how they want to credit peter jackson in rings of power.oh and jame is not that emotional. he s numb because of what he did searching for answers.
omg this article is just hurting my head.  glad to know you can just write an entire article openly projecting hate while saying nothing on the subject you are supposed to report about.
at one point people gotta start reporting and   or call this type of stuff hatespeech  too.
I d just like to point out Christopher columbus was an italian man and thus likely had dark hair with dark eyes  not blonde with blue eyes. also these games were made by japanese companies so technically speaking this would count as making  a diverse character  from that point of view. I ll admit I only played res7 and ethan was a bit bland in terms of lacking a personality as some of the previous re characters had  but it adds to the horror and makes you project yourself onto the character. all this article is  is just hate on white dudes cause I guess we are all evil now all of us white people!
Imean I guess this isn t an inappropriate place completely but shouldn t this be saved for a video or channel where the person actually has stuff to say about the sh remake  melonie here hasn t even played the sh games.
@chandler burse Im stating my concern about the game as a fan. Im not bashing melonie.
narcissistic men  we dont all live in hollywood.
I dont understand the hate towards good family men  do they purposely want deadbeat dads and broken families
this is just... sad. to make such weak claims against a gaming icon like james sunderland and  by extension  ethan just shows their colossal ignorance and personal bias  racism .on james sunderland  he is a deeply complicated character stricken with grief and looking to emancipate himself from his sins. he is a man consumed by his vices  hoping for a chance at redemption  having to brave a terrible situation that he finds himself in. in summary  he is a flawed protagonist  its even debatable that he is an fallen or failed one  which this article writer seems to greatly resent.
a wrestler got released from wwe and posted a picture of broken shackles and was called racist for it. Imade the clerks joke  look at you  saying someone cant do something bc of the color of their skin  now who s the racist.  dude legitsaid  minorities cant be racist.  this chick has thatsame energy but worse
to be totally fair and its kinda a spoiler james isn t exactly a good dude.ethan getting shit on isn t ok though because he s actually cool
wait kotaku is still alive   weird.
imagine trying to bash what s arguably the greatest psychological survival horror game of all times that hasn t been topped to this day because a japanese company based in japan decided to use a white protagonist. you know back when games could have deep dark very flawed timeless characters that would fascinate us for decades to come instead of being focused on shallow modern day politics and the color of one s skin.
I once had a friend comment on how  alfred never would ve shown vicky vale the batcave  in tim burton s batman.I said  you do know batman isn t real
when people make comments melonie like that it gives scientist s and the rest of us clues as to why tigers eat their young.
started watching listening to a playthrough of arkham knights. literally 50   henchmen   are women. news reporter is muslim woman. mayor is muslim woman. villains all old  white men. I love diversity in ma vidya gaems
men aren t encouraged to nourish their souls. so they deserve whatever they get. um...ok.
the only thing fair about that headline is that ethan winters is a boring protagonist. then again  I dont see how a  funny  protagonist would help add to the horror element in a horror game  let s be honest  re4 isn t horror  thats why leon can get away with cheese one-liners  hopefully the remake is scarier than the original .
as a latino male with brown eyes and brown skin  I find that whole article racist. what ever happened to being inclusive  aren t we all human  dont we want great stories and great games without focusing on the color of people s skins  and we re talking about a great horror franchise like silent hill that came out decades ago! I love silent hill! clearly someone isn t a real fan. people really have nothing better to do. race was never a problem for me. I think its time to cancel the cancel culture.
@melonie mac go boom you should check out the scorn game. it looks super creepy.
I agree that kotaku isn t very reliable  but I disliked ethan because he was a boring character  not because he is white. he reacts to things like a stiff board.
love your videos but you could have summed this up with  they weren t made for you!    then break out the popcorn and watch them squirm under their own deluded logic.
imagine if someone makes a videogame where a white guy protects a white woman from a black guy  the amount of whining and tears would be something beautiful to see
def think they deleted this article lol cant find it anywhere
as much as I hate kotaku  I have to agree with them... atleast in ethan s case. compared to all the characters in the franchise  he is bland  boring  uninteresting and pretty brainless... still liked re7 and loved re8.
jeez  how are they allowed to get paid to write something so descriminating
yes
exactly correct. I never had a problem playing as franklin clinton  or lara croft. real players never think about that kind of thing  you just enjoy the games. my first big musical influence was michael jackson. I never once thought about his color. his songs  style and moves shined brighter than anything about race.
honestly the re protagonists never had a ton of personality to them. its not like leon or chris was any better. what people tend to remember from re aren t the protagonists  but the side characters and villains. wesker  ada wong  lady d  jack  etc.
@taragnor  leon has a lot of personality showing in 4 like what you talking about lol.
this author on kotaku thinks all white men that have blonde hair probably have blue eyes  so they relate them to the not-sees as that was supposed to be the perfect human. the only untalented hack I see is the author of this sad attempt of a po article  and calling it an article is being kind .funny how she s now complaining about how james and ethan are apparently sniveling men. isn t that what they wanted  a man that was more feminine  beta  rather than having  toxic masculinity   alpha   shows you cannot please this sjw woke people. they are miserable in their own lives so they want to make everyone else miserable because its not fair others are happy when they are not. wow. she needs to go outside and touch some grass. lol!
its kinda valid to dislike ethan. he s literally the most boring re protagonist
racism against people of european ancestry has gone too far.thank you for covering this.
well  ethan winters did whine like a boring family man. but its fitting he turned out to be a giant fungus  because most family men I know do moulder away.now the duke! there s a guy who enjoys life. he would be fun to hang around with.
hate to hear what they have to say about leon kennedy in some of the other resident evil games
the real tragedy with this moron s article on re8 and silent hill is that video game developers companies are unfortunately starting to adhere to nonsense like this. the hypersensitive minds at kotaku are just trying to insert their own real-life social values into fictitious video games  which is silly and ignorant. re8 and silent hill aren t meant to supply critical thinking and or anti-feminist agendas  like this article   just enjoy the ride  they re great horror games!
as a resident evil fan  I personally dislike ethan and his story  but  what was this person from kotaku expecting with james and silent hill oh yes  she probably wanted james to be a black or brown lgbt person in the remake. because being from the lgbt  community and being any other color than white is soooo interesting and mind blowing.
its just for rage clicks. thats the only thing keeping them afloat. please just ignore them and let it die.
so many games with white  male protagonists coming out soon. Im just so excited... said no one ever.
why is the article shitting on the guys outfits like its an actual point to make and factors into the story lmao. imagine the effort to sit there and actively think thts a good idea
2 dogs ! what happened to your kitty !
you know what s funnier  she criticize the blond protagonists but she herself has a blond hair. feels like she s projecting herself in these dudes  apparently
if they could you know  not. yeah  that d be great  thanks.
as rude as this lady is  she could have atleast put a spoiler warning on the damn article.
at 2 17  Im a blonde white man. straight too.
she calls columbus stupid yet she thinks he was some blonde hair blue eyed arian....
I would love to copy paste this post   chance white to black see how fast we can get banned
is that a tomb raider reference in the back   the blue sninglet with the jacket
gaming community has so many weirdos
step 1  write an article that makes no sense and contributes nothing to societystep 2  get paidstep 3  do it again
she said in the comments that articale was a shit post to get clicks and money. but Im not fully sure thats true
haters gonna hate  potatoes are gonna potate. o well.
awww the cute doggies
btw ethan and james are not thee same kind of people sorry for the spoilers but is a game from 2000 james killed his own wife and is completely remorseful because of it
they want a pink-haired pansexual protagonist on a quest to protect their them sexual identity....
the little dogs hahaha so smol
hate clicks are the only clicks they get anymore so they have to do dumb shit like this
I dont want to spoil silent hill 2 s ending but james sunderland is a psychopath lol  not really a guy I d support but thats apart of the whole story.
is that a real article   itsounds as if was just a page in her journal  rambling stream of thought.
why the heck a  gaming  site is publishing articles like this
ashley was hurt by a blonde white man in her past. ignored by a crush or maybe served the wrong coffee by one in starbucks...the hate is strong with this one.
aye if you ever need a pasty white guy mel  Im right here!
sad thing is silent hill two guy killed his wife and went to hell and good ending is forgiven for what he didre 2 cop 1st day on job zombie outbreak tried to help everyone he came across not kill themre 7 and village saving missing wife from slime girl  save daughter from mad scientist womanleon scott kennedy lawful goodethan winters chaotic goodjames sunderland beat his sick wife to death  so he didn t have to change her bed pains anymore  evil or evil act
james is boring  oh boy they never played silent hill they just coment on apearence news flash to kotaku silent hill is about the internal psychological trauma of its characters
melonie they serve some of those agendas  this one  is to keep man and women divided.
dead space  one   your welcome
predator laugh!
Im way more offended they compared the walking avatar of ethan to james who literally went to hell and back fuck ethan capcom makes horror adjacent games.
awh the little doggo at the back
this is like saying laura croft samus and the female fromsoft protaganists are the same characters.
james is more imortant to his inside  he is a man who is flawed his anger his pain his guilt his desire to be punished for what he did he is a tragic character and never would I call him boring
those gamejournalists are some vile creatures I tell ya.
I agree with you melonie but james is not a good family man it is a big part of the story of why he isn t without spoiling anything
do they know if they identify as men
have they played x.  of course not or they d work for an actual gaming site  not a social media site that accepts game ads.
evolutionary fear  when youre such a chad historically you affect the genetic code of your lessers.
well I hate them right back so...its all good
this woman should get fired and sued...
welp they want to get frosked like g4 then
wait for her to play re 4... lol
blackface velma would make a great protagonist
kotaku is always a cesspool of weirdos.
these are the same people thatsaid deacon from days gone is just another white protagonist
who s ethan  I think you mean chadthan!
its just outright I hate a family man who s straight and white and who the main character isn t a woman but I dont want to outright say itso Im gonna subtly say it   fail
Im not gonna let this bullshit affect me
Imean now theres gonna be plenty of jokes for trans women and men to relate to wich is everyone that crazy people just realllyyyy dont like us
I dont get these hacks  they re attacking these characters for being white when they re you know  first of all characters with depth like most actual humans regardless of color  and second of all made by japanese people. there was no white influence on the decision they just wanted they re characters to be american. and these two aren t even the same  james and ethan are completely different in who they are as characters  one tragic  one heroic. this is just stupid.
its totally boring that james sunderland is not wearing full bondage gear and has a same-sex lover!!!!!!!!-carlos maza  probably
I only subscribed for more dog in the backgtound vids.
its the elitest small hats behind all of it.
king
oy vey
how would gaming journos know anything  most never play the games anyway  they just get told what to say by companies for freebies.
whoever wrote this has some serious mental problems. bringing up sylvia plath s suicide and hoping characters in a video game die the same way. who the hell writes like that.
thats so annoying cause these people keeps talking about things they cant begin to anderstand...silent hill is not a game about heroism its about self knowlege the city takes all the protagonists psychological issues and throws at tham as a weapon so they have overcome their most intimate fears pain and sexual desires  and in most games theres not even a good ending because its not a happy  game its a game about mental illness its not a game bout charming characters there you wont find cloud ethan drake or ellie only broken people.
imagine a feminist talking about narcissism.
correction  straight white men  and conservative men of any color. also  hair looking good  my dude.
these posts are all starting to look like rage threads on a community board
harry mason in silent hill 1  go hell to save his  missing daughter  and murphy pendleton silent hill downpour get him self arrested   to take revenge on his son s murderer
I love your dog
lol these people have no self insight
Im a gaymer and Im so over the hate for straight white men. Im sick of lara croft not looking or acting like lara croft. I stopped going to mainstream videogame new outles years ago and haven t regretted itsince
sounds like someone that hasn t played the games at all. both characters are extremely different.also columbus was blonde with blue eyes  he was italian ffs.also x 2 the attack on attractive people seems to come from envy  insecurity and emotional immaturity.
this articles breakdown of james is literally just wrong tho did they not actually play through to the end
@00 41 nooooo ! come play callisto protocol with me - grab a ps5 and join me in dec. I love horror games - I would love to see you playing some spooky games - happy halloween 2022 melonie mac go boom.
the funny thing about these comments I realize these characters are fictional lol.
sad what  game journalism  has become. truely pathetic.
do you like pickles
never heard of them...
how many critters do you have
why is the site still around.
kota who
heyyyyy  I love the little doggy
hope you hear this all the time but you are very beautiful-so so pretty!
that being said ive think that harry mason the first protagonist of silent hill 1 is far better family man n protagonist besides henry townshed the protagonist of silent hill 4
someone had daddy issues and got rejected bij a white man .. omg .. she needs help.
kotaku doesnt exist if we choose to believe it
the want every character to be like awful abby from the last of us 2
ngl itsounds like this journo was thirsty af and recently frustrated by this demographic and just smearing their personal issues all over their work life instead of at their therapists office where it belongs.
gaming  journalist  hated cal kestis as well because he was white in jedI fallen order.
I wonder where these people would be without columbus  oh right they wouldn t exist. Im down with the part where people like that dont exist. they re not gonna be missed.
sounds like this person never played the game and or they didn t understand the story of these games
ashley has blonde hair lol
ethan doesnt even have a face
this article is genuinely sciz
urinalists gonna pee.
looking deeper  things make more sense  not only does she have daddy issues but she reads pop-psych dreck by a soviet era bulgarian french philosopher feminist psychoanalyst.
you gotta stop giving these nobodys attention
this girl is like a much smarter and better looking pokimane. a pokimane  if u will
the original silent hill 2 is far too cerebral and has too much subtext for these people.
whoever wrote this article is just a horrible human being.
to be fair ethan winter was as boring and milk toast as they can get. and if you dont think the silent hill 2 remake is gonna get  censored and woke... then you have a big surprise coming
actually  I think I remember ages ago thatsome woman was hating ethan for being cis white male or someshit
love you
this isn t a  woke religion . religion has some virtue. this is a cult!
I dont know whats more impressive  thatsomeone can write something downright sexist and racist and think it is ok.... or that the editors at kotaku were dumb enough to let itsee the light of day on their site.  but then kotaku is pretty much a joke so shrug the most likely reason the writer cannot empathize with these characters is mostly likely due to the fact that they lack all forms of empathy.  someone also needs to tell that writer that uh... you dont feel remorse as a narcissist. narcissists think it is all about them  and therefore  there is nothing to be remorseful over.  much like the person who wrote this  gaming  article.
I thought I saw and heard italians celebrating columbus because he s one of their own  was he not italian sailing under the spanish flag  are there blonde hair and blue eyes in the italian gene  guess I ll go look something up...
your basically beating a dead horse with a stick when it comes to talking about kotaku they are a site meant to trigger people and give out their opinions for people to comment on so they can stay afloat
if ethan was literally exactly the same any every way  no dialogue change  no gameplay change at all  but instead a black woman trying to save her lesbian lover this journo would be shouting proudly fron the rooftops in praise of it.
puppy!
these people need to stop hating everyone based on their skin. isn t that called racism
sounds like julia kristeva and ashley bardhan need a man  or to at least meet a real one
they dont buy nor play any of these games
ashley lives in brooklyn  ny.
some losers vehemently hate winners. they see a constant reminder of their failures and inferiority.
people still read kotaku
umm  this jorno does know the characters aren t real  right  right.
lift my brothers
what even is the purpose of such article  is kotaku really so insignificant  that they feel the need post such trash just to get any kind of attention
itsounds like she cant stand thatshe wants a blonde white man
you need to play left 4 dead 2
pls stop
wow those @    are really getting desperate
the article comments the writer said its a shitost stating she is happy to make money of anoying  disgruntled gamers
well I know for a fact that the auther of this artical has never even touched sh2 as while you may not like james and thats fair hate is something else james works perfectly as the protag of that game and I will not say more for spoilers go play the damn game
or grandfathers were right.about everything.
kotaku who
boring protagonist  is the far left way to say  not enough tokenized protagonist .the racism from these people is insane.
bruh its literally a remake they not going to change the characters from the original game lol
not all blonds are white same goes for redheads dont the folks at kotaku know this
everyone on here saying the person who wrote that is white. she isn t.
what s wrong with wearing jeans
these people are hilarious because they are same people who get mad at fan s for disliking female characters or non white characters that are bad and badlywrittenbut they themselves dislike the character for simply just being a white male  make it make sense.
did this journalist just complain that the women in the game were more interesting than the protagonist.  who  let s face it is usually blank-slate to facilitate audience self-insert
thats a whole lotta words to say  white man bad . dreadful  embarrassing articles like this are why if kotaku was a magazine  I wouldn t even wipe my ass with the pages of it.
see  kotaku are the true racists
and the article s writer is a blonde woman  figures...
these people are suffering from inferiority complex
that article is just the ramblings of  mad woman.Jesus Christ the venom
3 13 ok this girl thats writing this article need professional help  this is going far beyond political nonsense.
xd
first spoilers ethan is fongus not a real human since re7. james we all know he is a killer and nothing to do with ethan
let me guess  jewish
her hair is dyed blonde. as for her race... let s just say at least one of her parents probably wears a tiny hat on their head.
the ads are to much ....one saved his wife the other one killed her. yeah really the same!
the tolerant people strike again  how unusual.
this is why women and men will never understand what it means to be in each others shoes  oh wait because thats stupid  especially in a video game let dudes with badass skills and one liners be cool for the dudes and let the girls play them if they want  just dont go adding woke bs into them.
these are the same people who forced capcom to make the female character  especially jill  look ugly in recent games
to be fair  ethan s dialogue is really terrible to me. the voice actor also did a pretty poor job at his reactions. but thats genuine criticism about the character.
Jesus Im a black guy and this was a bit harsh
woman power. ....untill the wall looms.
I like when people like this see me  get angry that white people exist  then I tell them that Im latino and they get so confused an apologetic.
spoiler alert  ethan is not a white man...ethan in-game is a black mold.
lol   just read the comments on that article and  ms bardhan states that itshould have been obvious this was just a poopie story  lol  and hoped no one took that part about columbus seriously.   lol  she just wrote something to collect a check!   hahahahahashe needs to up her game   the true professionals created an entire tv show worth millions to  troll the trolls.    xd   ahahahahahha
kotaku    who even subscribes to their site anymore. I thought they died out years back. despite having 2 million twitter followers  from when they were relevant years ago   hardly anyone interacts with their tweets anymore today. they re chalked full of these types of takes. they re as popular as the mary sue. lolnext.
kotaku really needs to just shut up
they are g4
Christopher colombus was not white
james ethan  never like re 7 or 8 james is cool
not to be sexist but of course its a woman who wrote this article like wow
but both of these games are made by the japanese correct  if so 1  I dont think they give a shit what americans think 2  they dont give a shit about you.also they act like they wouldn t completely break down if the saw a dead body much less a quarter of the things these characters go through. like you said about men being men in the same vein they hate the nuclear family so a family man going through actual hell to save his family disgust them
if you haven t played silent hill 2  dont watch. the article she reads spoils the ending.
pretty sure this person is trolling.no one can genuinely be this unhinged.
I wish hulk hogan sued and bankrupt kotaka instead of gawker. at least gawker used to be kinda funny. kotaku has always been cringe
also if the writer feels that way about james sunderland then they clearly haven t played silent hill 2. because james and silent hill in general is way more complicated and nuanced than this idiot kotaku writer lets on.
sadly people get paid to write this hateful stuff and make it public
dont show them nier games!
imagine being butt hurt over a fictional characters. lolalso  this so called  journo  is aware that japanese companies made these games and characters  right   I dont think all the nonsense from this  journalist   and people like her   ever crossed the story writers  minds when they created these 2 characters  and let s be grateful for this.   maybe japan should be scared of opening up their borders to foreigners too much  especially if these weirdos are what s coming to them... yikes...
early life section
james is untalented but thats a given silent hill everyone is untalentedbesides alessa heather  all sioent hill protaganists are basicly the same as call of cthulhu protaganists every day people with their own problems the only soecial thing is their all so traumatised by somthing in their life
eh... Christopher columbus  the man who called first native americans he s met  handsome and intelligent  in his personal diary  available online
silent hill 2 is way more scarier than any resident evil game period..
I d be willing to bet money this woman dates white men and loves blonde hair
yea  trashfire article.
who s paying for this
Im a straight  white male everyone. Im sorry. I know Im a monster.
james sutherland isn t a family man though.
Christopher columbus was italian and not a blonde! also he was based!
people going to stop hating on white folks man Im only half white but Im starting to loath myself
bugmen cope
suspiciously good looking women talking about crappy article with negative things to say about is a youtube genre now.
at the first minute of the video and already commenting the title is gonna piss off almost every sh fan out there I remember this person s bland review of re8 the game wasn t even played for the review infact it wasn t even available for reviewers to try
ref
eh. let her have her little bs article on a bs website. she s literally inconsequential. stay mad  ashley.
italians can be blonde  my man  especially in those times. and yes  he was unfathomably based.
@the maus  I know that they can be blonde but was he
wow attacking two beloved characters just to be racist. sounds like kotaku
aren t these people supposed to be inclusive...
so from all the thing that they can critic and hated from silent hill they choose these crap white skin thing uuugh... but konamI deserve all the hate tho litteraly cancel p.t then replace with these another lifeless garbage  good job konami
wait  I thought it was bad to be offended. I thought playing the race card was also bad. I thought we weren t supposed to victimize ourselves. I thought we weren t supposed to be snowflakes. I guess its different when its about us   the rules dont apply
as far as I didn t know Christopher columbus was in italian are spanish. I know he was white with blonde hair. Imean thats more on cant even get characters in history right and she s writing articles and getting paid for it. what a waste of money
waiting for kotaku to go out of business. one of the worst gaming sites out there.
this is what happens when activist sjw type weirdos become  journalists.
kotaku is just a joke
this entire artical was a shitpost. this is all a joke  ashley posted on twitter saying that the entire artical was a joke and not to be taken seriously.
silent hill 2 is one of my favorite games ever. and I am neither white or american but I guess in the  current year  unless I see myself in the game I cant like it or something that a self hating white californian thinks.
as a straight white man Im am offended
when did hate speech become okay
first nice dog over there second some people hating fictional white men characters so stupid.
who even listens to kotaku
sjws  wow so your telling me hes not gay  trans  black  asian  female  an activist or antI trump  this game is going to suckeveryone else  ooh new silent hill game  nice.
ya gotta laugh when racist s call the kettle white.lol.wonder if they have the letters  r  and  l  written on the back of their shoes with a sharpie
its a japanese game.. its literally made by japanese people. japanese people who are famously not white. its always ironic how these people are often the most racist by ignoring that the world is larger than america and the big bad british empire that quite literally single handily fought all the empires if the world to rid the world of slavery. they always seem to forget that middle eastern and east asians exist. like japanese are people as well. why does no one care about them  surely they ve heard of japan  like they must have heard of samuraI and stuff  perhaps not then. they must believe silent hill 2 was made in boston as thats as far as their historical and geographical knowledge will allow
and all black man are the same oh ... wait you cant say that
stuff like this makes me happy to be a white man. people hating on me for no reason. its hilarious.  must be so nice to be blonde  blue eyed  beautiful.... and evil!  lol... yes  it its.
both characters were created by japanese companies  so this  journalist  is attacking japanese people for their creations  her asian hate is disgusting.
even so its still poorly written lol
my question to this  journalist   is what in the fuck were their  sick terminally hostage wives  supposed to do while they were  waving their guns in fields at night like lollipops
its kotaku  full of pathetic soy boys or ladies without an ounce of empathy  anyone with common sense wouldn t have any respect for them.
I celebrate the white male patriarchy every day for giving me the first world and inventing manufacturing 99.99  of every necessity and convenience in my life.
Imean ethan is not a great character  and a lot of people hate him for different reasons  but just hate him becasue he is a white blonde family man  oof
where s the sexisms and racism at
as a white blond im offended xd but not really. its just racist everyone deals with racism
dlc has rose as the main character  other resident evil games had women as protagonists. there is room for different charecters. this is just a hate article on a charecter that is not even real lol  kotaku what a joke
kotaku are a bunch of misguided punks and unprofessional  journalism .
and why do people read this place if they dont agree with politics of it  lets them swim in their own pool  why bother to even talk about this trash  its not exactly a secret about what and who kotaku represents  its been like this for a few years now. its like if you went on some lgbt site and then surprised that they promote lgbt.
meh  nobody listens to kotaku anyway. dont even know how they re still around. I still cringe when I think of that ps5 review.
james sunderland is a freaking classic. there no  white  problem!!! do you have ideas who made this game ! sure wasn t white peoples
not sure if they are white  they look asian with white features.
what she is doing would be considered racist if the protagonists were anything but caucasian. these people are so weird.
as a silent hill fan if you know  everytime the game was put in western developers hands or non japanese the games have been horrible.I dont think itso much about white men.when I saw the developers team I was very disappointed
cyborcat is seething with rage  over this rock stupid hot take from a  journalist  I d recommend looking up her reviews of silent hill 2.
Jesus why do they allow such sexist articles to exist  oh wait its kotaku
so its okay to be a misandrist online but pointing out anything wrong with feminism and you d get canceled
the  author  doesnt know where it comes from. they should. it comes from bigotry  prejudiced  and racism. the greatest myths about racism is that you cannot be racist against white people  you can and many are. that you cant be a self hating racist  you can be. that racism requires power and privilege  that is also not true. that racism is only when you believe youre superior  that is also not true. the most common form of racism comes from fear. so people clutching their purses is one common example. also one of the worst is victim racism. that is racism thatstems from your belief that youre the victim and all members of this group are perpetrating harm on you. that was the racism of the nazis when hitler rose to power. he wrote a manifesto on it that was published in germany.
ashley bardhan already admitted that this article is a shitpost to make a quick buck.
same boring protagonist y know  the same could be said for game journalists and their articles.
Im seriously tired of the white bashing. there are some things that you just cant control  like skin color. what  we re never supposed to have a white male protagonist in a video game again
silent hill is about broken people.  if they were black they would be crying about black people portayed that way
how do they them know ethan winters is a white man  we never saw who ethan is  maybe he is a persian woman.
this article doesnt have any redeeming qualities.
yea you should play silent hill 2 but what this chick wrote about james is so wrong on alot of levels she clearly couldnt understand how deep the game really is I wont ruin it for you but go try the game its good
kotaku trying to get attention by playing the race card. but again its only angry white women from kotaku screeching for attention.
no talented wokie journos from irrelevant kotaku are still around
I dont like ethan winters but cause he is a generic character that doesnt appeal to my liking like leon ect james looks great this is  just ridiculous.
and of course we get the trademark appeal to authority where the author cites some hippopotamus-shit feminist tome that nobody with an actual life outside of tumblr has ever heard of.what was the point of this article again
kotaku has been a joke for years. imagine getting paid to write such a stupid article.
do people still read what kotaku says nobody likes racists.
thank God the japanese dont simp to  woke  bs.
what is this wierd ass trend to hate on white men  as a black guy I am confused.
please keep hating on me  the more you hate on me the more it makes me respect you and your cause. hahaha
what a horrible pointless article.
did colonizers invent diversity
so apparently racism is ok now  huh I didn t know.is it ok for me to say that I only like asian women now because all other women freak me out  or is that not ok
gay men are cool though. you tell because hollywood says so.
no kotaku  we dont want james sunderland to be a black lesbian woman in the remake  this is konamI  not netflix.
who is reading these articles   who are they written for   I dont think sad  lonely  man-hating women generally read about video games
do any japanese people even work there  I see my beloved japanese people looking whiter than white people.
where we re those people when final fantasy seven remake came out  is cloud also a boring blond hair blue eyed white man  I played the original silent hill 2  that man is a badass.
why are you covering kotaku staff on anything they have been dead for years you being on youtube is more important than them let dinosaurs die.
kotaku is garbage. may they go the way of g4  even if it takes them a while.
kotaku is so lame. please play silent hill 2 its so great. or any silent hill they are all awesome at least the ones ive played
what a useless article. its a glorified  meandering youtube comment that gets to masquerade as an opinion piece. and then to cap it off with  I think they deserve it   as if you just laid out a brilliant essay for your perspective and capped it with the perfect bow tie at the end is so pretentious and cringe.
to be fair  ethan winters is a bland  boring  lame protagonist.
blond white girls complaining about blond white dudes
are gamers these days still edgy red pill nerds  the article doesnt even say much about the character being white but being boring. you cant hate boring characters if they re white now or something  bro  just play your game and stop all the shitty takes on politics.
ah  another racist  and sexist writing for kotaku.
because caucasian is the global minority.
thats why naughty dog killed off joel in last of us pt2. just another boring white man.
oh youre entire personality isnt based around whatever sexual profile you identify with  boring. you can only be interesting if you hit the random button in the character creator of life.
japanese wrote and created these games so stop your crying. white men had nothing to do white it.
probably not blonde and definately not white... I d say she comes from a family that wears tiny hats.
