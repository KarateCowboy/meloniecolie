to this day  I will never understand how anyone could look at an animal of any kind and say   I d hit that.
I hoped for a second this was like people accidentally getting leprosy from contact with armadillos. but no  its the bad version. wait. they forcey fun-timed the lizard  then cooked and ate it  thats...grotesque. and they filmed it. gabe  get the trumpet. no  I will not calm down! have you seen what they re doing to the lizards
gang-relationed see  this is why I advocate every lizard goes around with a gun.  you never know when you ll need to protect lizardself. you said  a protected monitor lizard  but she sure sounds unprotected to me
yeah I could have went my entire life without this video. these boys saw the lizard man in spiderman one time and was never the same again.
Im with melonie on the  show their faces  shame  shame!  part.  not so much for the shaming part  but to sexually quarantine them.  if they have stds from that obscenely stupid act  which was definitely some kind of demonic influence on top of raw idiocy   every future sexual partner they seek out  needs to have some way of knowing that.  when they re not showing their faces they re allowing them to spread it to others  although if they re gay they re going to do that anyway  if they didn t catch it from the lizard .also the comment regarding leftists proverbially eating their own reminds me of those one alien spiders in the 1998 lost in space movie they ate their wounded as well
bro  some people are really heartless to hurt a animal like that...
sandeep pawar   man  guys. Im starving. mangesh kamtekar   hey  a lizard! we could eat that. akshay kamtekar   okay. I caught it. let s eat. ramesh ghag   hey guys  would this lizard taste better... cream filled  all four   .............. yes.
I literally laughed out loud when you said this was a family event! oh man  Im dying!
agreed. you can really tell a lot about someone by how they treat their pets.
forget clown world  we ve now entered hell world.
the face melonie pulled where she had to change her words to  gang relationed  cracked me up xd
...this is absolutely hilarious and so well deserved  just a shame that it was the only lizard there.
the worst part is that they made a video. gang-up-relationed   is the euphemism I will be using from now on.
as disturbing as this is  the fact they survived and didn t get bitten is impressive. monitors are powerful and extremely dangerous. their venom causes the flesh to rot and fall off the bones.happy side note  Im glad youre sticking with your natural hair instead of straightening it.
post-nut-hunger clarity hits hard sometimes
melonie  thank you for your verses of the day and for your prayer group. Im an atheist on a bad day and an agnostic theist on a good day  but something compelled me to go to your prayer group. I had a wonderful experience and would love to tell you about itsomeday as it was incredible. your community was wonderful and welcoming and I will definitely be back next week.
hey mel  greetings from wales in the uk. I love your vids  I agree with you on most things and youre a breath of fresh air in this day and age.I was wondering if youre a fan of xena warrior princess  I started a rewatch and forgot how amazing it is! it got me wanting a reboot  but then I thought of all the ways they d make it woke and instantly changed my mind. keep up the good work
me  reading the video title everyday we stray further and further away from the Lord...melonie  reads article saying it happened in indiame    someone of indian heritage  well damn.
puts a new meaning to the term  monitoring  the situation.
a buch of gamers returning from pax listen to this video in the car. 10 minutes later   bruh  if your clan shows up youre gonna get relationed like a petco guinea pig    duuuude    pog . huh. thanks melonie!
for real. there are some seriously demented individuals out there.
there are some really out there things going on in the world. you should check out thatstory about a woman that married her dog. yikes.
animals  and that means all of them  are actually in the list of stuff God said youre not supposed to have sex with in the book of leviticus.
in real life  captain kirk wouldn t want to lay every alien he sees because most of them would surely be gross to us  and we would be gross to them . lol
would this make me a furry  .. smash.  - markiplier
some women literally love horses in thatsorta way lmao.
tell that to randy marsh.
Jesus is tarrying to give people time to repent  when I hear stuff like this  I wish he wouldn t tarry.
archangel michael cant come soon enough.
poor lizard. he could have been a good doctor or an engineer. the monitor lizard did nothing wrong.
@marcus vipsanius agrippa   also they are an endangered species.   lizardstoo
damn straight God must be in one hell of a bad mood over these spineless lil scabhead being inhumanly cruel to his creations.
I liked that movie. wish the series showed more creatures like that. other than that I agree.
@apocalypse  agreed there were some interesting parts of that movie such as their design choices for some things in it.  it would probably fall apart when you analyze the plot too deeply  but some of the way some things looked in the movie were rather cool looking
my first thought was busting my indian friend. like hey where were you  you have an alibI  hahahaIm just glad this one wasn t in the us.
@mr. marc g.  thats hilarious cause my friends would have done the same to me lol
watching you try to dance around the youtube guidelines with a headline this insane was gold.
I have heard of goats  sheep   dogs  now lizards. hmm some of those old testament laws and associated penalties are sounding mighty appropriate.
and reasons like this is why the human race is doomed
I laughed when I read the title of this video  but I wasn t laughing when I started watching it. what a horrifying story!
Ive heard of people doing this with other animals but never heard of it  happening to a lizard and just for fun people are just getting weirder
welll just when I think humans cant do anything more stupid and here we are .... love the content mel
I forgot I had scrolled past that on twitter  was not expecting a video about it.  may they catch something that causes a certain body part to fall off.  fun fact about angelina jolie as lara croft  I watched a behind the scenes and even she needed to be padded up to get the proportions right.  through melonie we go boom.  may your day be blessed.
yes! thank you! I had this exact scenario on my 2022 bingo card! in all seriousness  poor lizard
people really be out here attempting to summon slaanesh by themselves.
what the hell! ! poor animal. I just rescued a baby squirrel a few days ago  she has full access to my room  Im going to be sad when I release her  she s doing a lot better now. I hate animal cruelty!
clearly  these gentleman and I use the term loosely  adhere to the principal that families that gang-relation together  stay-together.   they get a heartfelt alex jones style  disssssgusting  from yours truly over here. maybe the wood chipper for these guys  but that could be a little harsh.  love that your sticking with your more natural hairstyle  it looks beautiful.  your knocking it out of the park on your recent vids  great job as always.
coverage like this  dudes gang-relationing a lizard  is why I subscribe to melonie mac go boom.  d
this was a family event
in tears laughing at this
Imean... you can kinda see one person doing this but four people together  how do people like that find each other  no one ever saw this consequence of social media happening.
y know  just when you think when you have heard of just about anything you hear about stuff like this...now I have heard of everything
Ive heard that one before  but done toward a human  as part of some cult ritual.edit  a duck would duck anything it can  certain type of penguin too.
I hope my laughing during this video doesnt mean Im some kind of a-a-p  but damn lol
I always thought these lizards were really strong and quite aggressive  I kinda suspect that vice got the order of operations incorrect and the kill happened first not second... with a thing that doesnt seem like couldn t get worse I think that might have made it worse
worms in the brain  only way to explain how someone is capable of this.
well natural selection called and it worked...
just like humans they come in all shapes and sizes  im sure they wouldnt have balls  no pun intended  to this to a komodo dragon. which is the biggest and most dangerous   agressive lizzard on the planet.
@afca nsf  the thing about many reptiles is that they dont go looking for fights  which would make them  aggressive.  more often than not  they are  defensive   meaning that you have to do something to provoke them.a wild komodo dragon is aggressive because it will come at you unprovoked. a smaller monitor lizard would be defensive because they know that they would never win if they attacked first  so fighting is a last resort.
alicia vikander was awesome in ex machina  never seen that tomb raider movie she starred in but I remember being on board for her casting. she definitely fits the  modern  lara look at least.and command   conquer ftw. the originals  red alert  etc. spent a lot of time on those in the 90s. same goes for the original two warcraft games  not so much starcraft surprisingly since Im a big scifI fan... also a lot of og fps games like doom  wolfenstein  blake stone  duke nukem  lil bit of commander keen thrown in there. and my largest time sink in that era  sim city 2000.
this story just keeps making me think of the opening scene of episode 1 of better call saul.
my mind is hurting right now trying to process how this is possible  also I am slightly drunk.
the 4 men  hey lizard.....you can monitor deez n.....sorry couldn t help myself xdlooks like we ll be getting that one race from the elder scrolls series sooner than we expected.
this exactly what they ve been doing in the uk for decades..  also throughout europe for years now.  family members go out gang raplng together.  this is so common that they even have a name for it in their culture.
wow  I just dont understand some people.  also  I gained 15 pounds in a little over a month on that carnivore diet.  I should have taken pictures.  208 lbs. isn t bad for 6  dude right   well  hopefully its all muscle.  you inspired me.  lol
just when you think the world cant get anymore wicked and bizarre some debauchery like this happens smh. anyways great verse.
if ever there was a case for the death sentence...
ngl  it was a bit funny to see melonie reacting to cursed content. also yeah  if something bad happens to these dudes  health  I wont be surprised nor feeling bad. not the type to go on revenge  but your actions have consequences
crap like this doesnt even phase me anymore. gang rape a lizard  eat it afterwards  get an std  yup...weirdest one I read about was maybe over a decade ago where some guy got arrested after having relations with a dead deer. what made it crazier was he was driving with his wife at the time and left her in the car to go and schtup it. can only imagine what was going through her mind at the time.we live in a weird messed up world.
can you please make the comments more on the screen  youre covering them. love your content
you have a carnivore crisps discount code ! how did I not know this  I just bought a bunch last week so I ll have to save it for next month. brisket is best!
gotta be honest. when I read the title I instantly assumed that this happened here in america
okay  yah  this is just...what the hells and I agree  you cantell the character of a person by how they treat animals... it illuminates so much.
hey melonie I just want to say that why in the heck that these awful people want to hurt or kill this lizard for  also what did this lizard do to them that they want to hurt it or kill it. anyway I hope these lizard killers get major jail time and get life in jail for mistreating   killing this nice and lovely lizard. anyway I just want to say bout this awful and sad story of this lizard  ok melonie. anyway I hope you have a wonderful   great blessed evening at home with your pets and have a good night and have a great week this week melonie.
I thought ive seen everything but it looks like I was wrong  I guess this is one carnivore diet you wont be supporting lol . all joking ness aside I do feel really sorry for the poor monitor lizard though.
rpg s were my favorite growing up but now that I am older I like all sorts of game and can not really label most of them . not sure what rts is if I had to guess I would say right  trigger  shooter . I still play and enjoy rpg s right now I am playing the new chrono cross port or remaster whatever you want to call it . I am not a fan of what they did to the serg model . he just looks like plastic now . I always thought kid was kind of hot and I am so happy to see them bring back chrono cross . I wish somebody would remake the game . I am not sure that I want to see the story changed but it would be bad ass to see the cinematics look more modern and every character given a voice acter .
janky and nasty
gang-relations you rock
I think we need a new darwin awards
its most likely the animal didnt have the disease. its those scumbags that did. they often lie that they got it from the animal to play victim.
uhhhh..... if dragonlamydia becomes a thing....there needs to be a tattoo for the forehead of people who have or ever have had it.
I see this title and my brain started to short circuit from the idiocy. what even is wrong with these people  but thank you for only spending 5 mins on it!!!
capital punishment is the only thing I would say about this situation.
that is just sad those guys did that
animals are cuddly - that is my einstein level take
its totally fine if you brutalize their names melonie  like they did the lizard. can hardly wait for the moon sized asteroid to hit this planet so it can reset. hair looking fly  love the natural look.
india.. figures. meanwhile in america  let s teach children about sexuality
some cultures are just better than others.
this stuff either makes you want pray for the humanity to be better  or pray for the asteroid to take humanity.
love the verse of the day!
I grew up with farmers. not large-scale. grandparents had a cow  a bunch of chickens  geese  dogs  cats. my local friends worked on farms  lived on them as well. chickens  goats  ducks  etc. from  chicks to calves and so on. I am not an expert  but I know enough about animals to know that even when you slaughter your own animals for meat  this kind of behavior is beyond the pale. even when you are not putting animals on a pedestal  people tend to do that these days  these men still did something sickening and evil. kids who did anything even brushing up against the notion of being like this were put right back in line quickly. someone failed these men  and they in turn have failed to be good people.
I knew no good would come from lizzard s night out
this is one of those things that just gets worse the more youread on
lmao. im sorry. that poor lizard. what the hell is wrong with people.
command and conquer generals zero hour  finally a woman after my own heart!
I will never be able to listen to dr. bombay s  shakey shakey snake  in the same way again...
in all seriousness  you did well to pronounce maharashthra  and I was coming close to misspelling it. . . .
this makes me hope hell is real. Im sure vaush doesnt see anything wrong with this lol
0 53 -  I have never seen a crime like this  no shit. Im surprised this wasn t in florida.
youre killing the curls baby girl!!! Im ready to get a theme song written for you. I would love to know if you d like your very own.
an asteroid is the only reset I could get behind of. none of that reset from the wef.
or cenk.
until the woke bs has become and thing of the past. I personally believe they should not bother touching the oldies. as they will just destroy its legacy and until the projects can get a crew that actually with be true to the game content. and until then all the games of the past are safe from be woked they should stay dead. I personally would rather this be the case than have them cut it from the inside out. as the saying goes  there are some things that are worse then death.
still better than the ny dating scene.
every day we stray further from God s light.
lizard   my brain registered lizzo.
in their defense.....that is a seriously cute lizard!
any dude that thinks of streaming for money would do well to remember the legend of spoony.  you first build the audience  and then you stream  and you continue to live like youre poor.  dont make promises you wont deliver on  dont count on streaming to pay for a house and lavish lifestyle  dont get hyper-political  and dont get with a girl that acts like youre infinitely wealthy and cantell all your fans to piss off anytime she s having a bad day.
that thumbnail tho  go boom!!
hImelonie  I appreciate your courage to stand up as a Christian and Im not trying to be negative  but I dont think your attitude that these people deserve to get some bad std s from what they did to that lizard paints an accurate picture of what Christ would say to them. judgement  belongs to God  not us  for very good reasons. again  please dont get discouraged by me  that  not my intent.
the highest lifeform on our planet is also its most disturbing.
I bet those guys work as scam callers...
I d say there s some bad karma there
bat shit crazy is the only thing that comes to mind on this one.
I dont even want to know the context to this story. xd
heavy sigh  anyone for a kaiju uprising
plot twist the lizard never had the std.
100  facts  drew yetti
woo lort  I did not expect you to do a video on this...
wow...you cant fix stupid and these guys are proof
Im a degenerate. Im not this degenerate. the hell...
guess you aren t calling Godzilla back.
rip dreams
hahah I wanna see them try doing it to gojI  that would be fun to watch xd he d give them a mouthfull they d never forget  remember the female muto xd
ohhhhhh my hoodness ! - they buffed it   filmed it and then! ate the protected lizard   without using a condom - sick0h z
seems like nightmare fuel. demons for sure.
lizard lives matter
tell you what  if they dont get stds  Im sure Godzilla would skoosh the heck out of them.
strange to meet you in  that  part of youtube...
its mating season!
another south park plot point coming true
looks like they took the lusty argonian maid a bit too seriously.
the furry virus affects people in weird ways
poetic justice would be too drop them in a pit of komodo dragons one by one so they know a small amount of what the lizard went through.
maybe they thought the monitor was a bisexual liz-bian.
why did I click on this video oh right melanie
damm these are some sick and cowardly individuals.
love your hair !
I feel thatseveral times  giggity giggity goo  should be insterted.
go home and go to sleep   or  get filthy fourths from a lizard.  cant decide...might need a few minutes to think this one over.
did the lizard lay human eggs
do it for the lol s  wait what
when truckers talk about lot lizards. this is not!!! what they meant!
thoughts before recording this video... how do I keep this a Christian channel
hehehehehehehehehe roadhouse
wtf  is literally all  all I could say.
aw  no longer new! -- congratulations!
steve irwin would not be happy
why on earth were these people fuckin around with lizards !
they do this to tourist women all the time and even their own women on the street in broad daylight. anybody surprised by this just isn t paying attention to the news coming from india.
facts
remember the result when randy did this in south park
of course they had to film it. who would believe a story like that otherwise  duh.
I am of two minds.on one hand  is it that hard out there that you got to go after lizards for  relief  on other hand  what the hell are the indian women doing to get there men to turn out like this
this is the 2nd one of these stories I accidentally watched in 2 hours.  it was either turkey tom or his tom dark channel talking about zoosadists that got away with it.
india.. well  I suppose when you have a pop of a billion these things are statistically bound to happen.
april the first you say    when was this first published  are you absolutely  sure  this article is a real thing
commenting to feed the algorithm
they made gay love to it and then ate it... here I thought I was into weird crap. lol
how was the lizard dressed. I bet it was asking for it. lizard shaming.
if so  I hope whatever they used fall off.
maybe they were pokemon fans with salazzle fantasies. and they say games dont lead to violence  tsk-tsk.
what the f    is wrong with some people  !!
ty melonie I was eatin then this pop up
who would ever have sex with a politician

they should tie the four men to trees in the middle of the park  the tigers will take care of the problem
demonic.
double yikes
well what was it wearing
please stop pretending you aren t fully aware of what Im talking about.if you decided to start doing no cam streams from now on you would get a noticable dip in viewers and engagement. and the reason why was perfectly explained  and ignored  by another regarding insecure desperate men and the unhealthy  addictive comfort of the illusion of the company of attractive women.the only point was thatside of twitch is praying on these unhealthy compulsions whether the person knows cares or not and it doesnt just apply to hot tub streams.
if they try to do that with an enormous crocodile  I wouldn t have any sympathy if they end up having their body or limbs snapped off. if they continue to be spiteful  I wouldn t blame the creatures for defending themselves. thats their stupid fault!
read the title ............hu  wow just wow.
sadism
let s hope none of these lizard  likers  are married ! I would feel terrible for their wives if they got something nasty. lizards like turtles and chickens can carry nasty bacteria. in fact monitor lizards have so many toxins in their mouth they hunt by biting a bigger animal like a cow or goat and waiting for all the bites nastiness to infect the animal to the point hat they cant move and then they can move in and eat
what the hell is wrong with people  that poor lizzy.    sorry God for saying this  but they should get the death penalty. being in corrupt india they ll already be back on the streets to reoffend to another beautiful and innocent creature.
sixth comment  if counting is still in x  d   still watching since im 9 min in  great stuff so far     early gang in
....wtf!!!
your hair is different  -oas to the topic of the video  omg   -o
india... enough said.
working on covid 22
sexual assault on animals was a death penalty offense in the old testament.
um...pass.
they are lucky lizard did not bite them. not that lizard has deadly venom. but the lizards mouth is so filthy.
Lord Jesus  please come back soon.... because the state of humanity at the moment... is so sick and so lost
Lord  send the deluge. no ark this time. please. no ark.
I dont watch reboots or anything disnee or wb. so depressing.
wat daaaa......heck
but y ...
I could understand killing and eating the lizard despreate people will do what ever it takes to survive but doin the nasty with the poor creature wtf.
quite frankly I think people that do this to animals should lose there lives   sorry  not sorry
not surprised indians gonna india
wtf
strangely not covered by the geico lizard
cool .  love you
I swear  every day we stray further away from God and move super closer to hell. if I was there and saw what they were doing  well  lets just say they wouldn t be around anymore.
this is how covid was made
what. the. fuck.
meow
what the actual fuck
dont monitor lizards spit acid
....wha...so not only....and then they...and they recorded....and they made bail! !  get the flamer  the heavy flamer!!!
what in the actual fuck
this sounds like a hoax.

these people are sick in the head. wtf
those guys were most likely furries. if you know anything about furries it ll start to make allot of sense.
liberals
just....what in the actual fck  people are sick. when I was in iraq I caught 2 guys in a field at night taking...uh....turns on a cow. was on watch and scanned over nearby farmland with flir and spotted them. I really wish I hadn t
someone in the comments said these guys are furries. no  these guys are zoophiles. here is my clarification.there seems to be a lot of misconceptions concerning furries. the biggest misconception Ive seen of furries is how the term is applied. the term furry is not synonymous with beastiality or sexual deviants. just like with any fandom  there are bad actors. these fringe groups should not define the entire community. even furries denounce these bad actors the term furry tends to have many definitions attached to it.some people who dont like furries would fit into their own definition of a furry  such as if they defined a furry as anyone who likes anthro art and media  while they themselves like movies like zootopia and kung fu panda  videogames like sonic the hedgehog  or characters like rocket raccoon . not everyone who considers themselves as a furry wear fursuits or attend furry conventions. some of them just like to make anthropomorphic art and media  and some just like to enjoy it.furries have been around for centuries as evidenced by anthropomorphic cave drawings  carvings  statues  clothing  and literature discovered from the past. they re not a new or recent thing. Christians  like myself  should not condemn good furries. in scripture  Jesus was referred to as the lion of judah and the sacrificial lamb. also the holy spirit himself took on the form of a dove during the baptism of Christ  so I dont think God is against furries.being a furry isn t about actually wanting to be an animal or committing sexual deviation. its about people coming together as a community to enjoy anthros with cosplays and cons like we do with anime  comics  or pop culture.
dune 2000 getting some love. house ordos always. long live the fighters.  by the way here s another actual girl gamer who is light hearted and fun. she s currently streaming elden ring  https   www.twitch.tv megshans tell her angel of sorrow s sent ya!
you have an extremely narrow and flawed view of what a furry is and paint it across a whole bunch of people. these are zoophiles  not furries.the term furry is not synonymous with beastiality or sexual deviants. just like with any fandom  there are bad actors. these fringe groups should not define the entire community. even furries denounce these bad actors the term furry tends to have many definitions attached to it.some people who dont like furries would fit into their own definition of a furry  such as if they defined a furry as anyone who likes anthro art and media  while they themselves like movies like zootopia and kung fu panda  videogames like sonic the hedgehog  or characters like rocket raccoon . not everyone who considers themselves as a furry wear fursuits or attend furry conventions. some of them just like to make anthropomorphic art and media  and some just like to enjoy it.furries have been around for centuries as evidenced by anthropomorphic cave drawings  carvings  statues  clothing  and literature discovered from the past. they re not a new or recent thing.

@daniel yerkes  found the furry
@angel of sorrow  and youre playing to the association fallacy as well as the no true scotsman fallacy that you accuse me of using. I dont even think you know what the no true scotsman fallacy even is.youre using a definition of the word that is not agreed upon and insisting upon that being the one true definition of the word. there are many definitions of furries and what people consider to be a furry  and I brought that up in my argument. Im simply pointing out that depending on the definition you use  different things fall into that definition.your biggest offense here is denying the personhood of the holy spirit. the holy spirit is a person. he is a person of the holy trinity of God. there are several articles proving that he is a person  and you d find them if you did a simple web search asking if the holy spirit is a person.also  just because you consider something to be a fringe group  that doesnt mean that it doesnt have its own fringe group.
@daniel yerkes  I haven t used a definition for anything. I have simply said that the term furry is known for its sexual deviancy whether you like it or not and you choosing to associate yourself with the term is no fallacy on my part. and if the term is not agreed upon then who are you  individually  to state that your definitions of the term are more correct or valid  and saying that the holy spirit was not  a person  was a bad choice of words. what Imeant was he was not in human form. so the holy spirit turning into a dove has nothing to do with God accepting furries considering furries are human. how you even made that comparison baffles me. the fact that you simply cannot just enjoy depictions and art without associating yourself with the term is what is oddly confusing. Imean I can be for equality without being called a feminist.
