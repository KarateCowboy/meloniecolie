I was very much a tomboy as well  still am but Ive never denied I was a girl.
gaslighting our common sense.  well said  melonie.
thanks melonie for being a strong independent woman who doesnt hate men. its super refreshing to hear women like you speak up!
actually somewhere between 1910 and 1930  I dont feel like trying to find the article again   the entire concept of blue for boys and pink for girls didn t even exist. that actually started because macy s had one of the most successful marketing campaigns ever. so yeah  I agree with you that things like what colors you like and your hobbies are not things that determine whether someone is a him or a her.
Ive seen case studies of intersex people  where a dr told the parent they needed an operation to become 100  male or female. most of these people ended themselves as they were mutilated as kids without consent. where as before they could experience self pleasure  they became non functional. imagine going through puberty or young adulthood having the urges and no way to release them... made me feel super bad for these peepsand yeah kids have no real sense of gender  boys  will play with dolls  girls will play war and throw rocks at each other. let kids be kids
watched this video last night. you said some things that I never expected to come from you. Im glad you said them though. keep being you. and always remember - God loves you  melonie.
thanks for being brave enough to say what a majority of people are thinking
people like darcy are just preventing themselves to grow up and grow when everyone else is moving past this and going on with thier days she will always find a way to bring this up
if a boy likes  girly  things it doesnt make him nonbianary it just makes him a boy who likes  girly  things.
they do not care if your opinions come from a place of hatred or not. even if they found these supposed people. that would just be the cherry on top. the only thing they care about is the simple fact you do not agree with them on the spot and without question. so no point in arguing with them. Imay only subscribed to your channel recently. however I admire what you are doing. you keep calling these people out and I think alot of your subscribers will agree with me. we will be here to support your channel. you keep just doing what your doing. we will keep tuning in.
congrats on getting 50k subscribers  melonie! Im glad youre posting videos more often! God s given you a lot of wisdom  so its always great when you share your thoughts and opinions on things. God bless you!
love you girl  from a girl  whatever that may mean in this day and age. please keep going on and on for us.
what bothers me is the policing of speech and asking people to be dishonest about the evidence of their own eyes for the sake of making others feel secure. if your comfort requires everyone around you to validate your existence and kowtow to you  then you have some much bigger issues to deal with and you shouldn t place the burden of your own insecurities at the feet of strangers. just my thoughts on the matter  I always try to be kind and respectful to everyone Imeet but their emotions are not my responsibility.
youre really pretty without eye makeup.this non binary stuff seems so odd to me. it feels like being non binary would somehow go against the other parts of the rainbow coalition. Im sure they wont let thatstop them though. they kind of get to play both sides of the fence.
you summed it up pretty well at 2 15. whenever I talk about this sort of thing with my friends I usually find myself saying   I get it  but Imean come on.  alllllll the time. because like ..come on.
I will happily watch your videos through to the end however long they are - keep going boom  melonie!
Imiss the days when people would get angry when the media used labels to describe someone now they love it.
its pleasant to listen to you. you have my respect.
the wild internet might be having a field day  but Im just glad that there s still people with common sense who will say what they think. you got a subscribe from me.
you are awesome for saying the things you do. more people need to  cause most of them do think this way just too scared to say anything.
lucky you!
so youre a real tomboy  not a lunatic. idk when the lunatics became tomboys but thats not what a tomboy is. real tomboys are cool af tho so no shade
world has gone fubar. end of days madness is what we are living in now.
yes!!! absolutely! I liked that quote so much that I added it to my personal  collection.
love it
the party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears. it was their final  most essential command.  - george orwell  1984
common sense  - you weirdos worship a magical palestinian carpenter that lives in the sky and is God  the son of God  and also a magical holy spirit who will one day come day and end all life on earth. and yet youre offended by gender lmao
homophobia isn t common sense.
@paul2377  not homophobia stop redefining terms just to grab power!
@horkbork m  I dont worships anyone or anything like  but guess what  they re still right. they re not offended  its called being baffled at the absolute nonsense of modern identity and gender politics
@aisha alamoudi  if its woke  then it isn t the best and never will be  though the  journalists  and  reviewers  were probably told to say its good even if it is complete shite .I dont care what writing or directing it has  if its woke propaganda it belongs in a volcano.
a fancy way of saying   I dont understand the concept presented to me  and that makes me angy
@nick fell  who are you talking to  use the tag system.
@andrew b  thank you. I was feeling heated. Ive calmed myself down. thanks for protecting the kids
@desert rose  whose side are you on  wokes or reality
@juicy pineapple     denying science and biology to suit my ideology is fun tho  and so validating  - katie  probably...
@juicy pineapple    oh trust me  they re a rabid ideologue
kids do  on majority boys like rough housing and prefer maths science
I agree  and therefore we need to push harder to end the practice of circumcision. these children should not be mutilated without their consent. they can get circumcised later in life if they so choose.
bless
exactly zero bravery was involved in the posting of this video
exactly
yeah ! just cuz Im a man who wears panties doesnt mean Im nonbinary. it just makes me weird. Im a weird man.

@lin kueI catastrophe  Im a tomboy  always have been. always loved games and sports. also always been a woman.
@fionalah  if you are confused by the lack of text in my other comment  this isn t a mind blower  it makes alot of sense.
believe me I know. Ive met my son. hehehe
@fionalah  what even is a tomboy  generally  I never understood why you have to be a tomboy to like sports and games. cant you like both typical girl and typical boy hobbies  and cant you be typically feminine while liking games and sports  why does one have to exclude the other  Ive seen typically masculine guys who love fitness and sports and yet are deep into anime and manga. many people think thats weird and doesnt go well. but I too love commercial sports  mostly football  huge fan of real madrid btw  yet I love gaming and anime manga. not sure if you meant youre a tomboy lookwise or your behavior. but I think its fine to have a rather masculine way of talking as long as you are not unnecessairily rude. its also fine to be a tomboy lookwise and like sports and games. the only thing I find strange is when women for some reason force themselves to look and talk like men. and not even regular men but the mos toxic and braindead version of a man. people need to learn that its fine to have different layers in their personality. because the sum of all these layers is what makes us unique in the first place.
@asinisterkiid
@pandaman  tomboy is just a description its like calling someone preppy. is it always an acturate description  no not for everyone but it conveys the idea the person using it wants to convey. my sister is the  tomboy  stereotype. she refused to wear girls clothes as a kid. she thought barbies are stupid and loved construction trucks. as an adult she still refuses to wear dresses. no one made her act that way and she doesnt force herself to act that way. she just is who she is and she s happy to be herself. she s the mother of 3 children and considers herself a woman and tomboy but not a lady.
very true. hatred is just their cop out excuse for not acknowledging the valid points people make criticizing their insanity
thank you so much  this means a lot
@aisha alamoudi  obvious comment spam is obvious lmao you posted that 6 times here  easy girl!
@aisha alamoudi   took a dive     face-planted into a puddle  - just semantics  right
@melonie mac go boom  stop promoting religion. and yes  saying you like it is bad enough. religion is disgusting and horrible. start to reflect on your life more and leave it behind. its extremely unhealthy to be religious.
yes  but thats assuming thats all that a nonbinary person is experiencing. like I was a ballet dancer who loved playing video games and wearing my brother s hand-me-downs  and in the 1990s thatsomehow made me a  tomboy.  but I was never ever confused about what gender I am. I have a very close nonbinary friend and I cantell you they legitsuffered from confusion up until age 30 when they first found the concept. its not the same thing as what I experienced at all  so I dont think its fair to just dismiss someone s suffering over confusion and feeling like an alien. we should be finding ways to help them feel less alien instead of brushing people off without any compassion
lmao
it does  but melonie and her ilk wont approve of that either if we re honest. she ll say something about boys who like girly things are probably gay and thats against the Bible!
@pandaman  individuality!
@gray libra  you are right but far left right politics only want to help themselvesat the end of the day.
@aisha alamoudi  never heard of it
@john thehumanist  I didn t say anything about politics  Im talking about humans treating other humans with compassion and respect regardless of political affiliation. cuz humanism
its more than just that of course.
its not that complicated. society has gotten all turned around and upside down on things that are supposed to be really  really simple.
@asinisterkiid  well I say you can shamelessly be whoever you wanna be
@asinisterkiid  no it means you may like femininity  which makes you a really cool feminine man!
yeah and I d agree about that if a kid just likes the other gender s hobbies and stuff but thats not always the case. unfortunately melonie doesnt wanna include real issues that real trans kids face with their experiences biologically and considering their gender identity. its not as simple as a boy liking feminine stuff  its way more serious than that and the pain that a teen can suffer in the wrong body is huge
@abdullah haroun  there is a difference between being a trans women or man and being nonbianary. yes  there are trans women who aren t boys who like girly things they want to be girls in every aspect of their lives. but nonbianary usually is I dont conform to typical stereotypes but I dont want to be the opposite sex so Imust be neither.
@stargazer kawaii  yeah I get that  they re beyond the gender binary. Ive actually had a friend who s non binary and they really do seem to not have neither male nor female attributes maybe the female tone of voice and body but these are genes..sooo
well thatshit gay
I hope this is pinned for all to see. extremely well put
@the eternal e lir  I appreciate that  it comes from a lifetime of experience. one of the most important lessons that anyone can learn  including myself years ago  is that to be a truly functioning adult you are responsible for yourself alone. if something is wrong then its up to you to fix it and grow from that experience or you ll always be an insecure and broken mess. shifting the blame onto other people or trying to sidestep the problem just leads to more dysfunction and you polluting the people and spaces around you.
@patrick quick  this is why Im glad to not be as beholden to emotion as neurotypicals.
bingo! they care too much about the opinions of others.
@patrick quick  you have no right to deny anybody s identity. you need to realise trans people spend nearly all of their adult lives to live as the opposite sex. not everyone will feel comfortable with the body they are born in.
@a w   no one has any  right  to demand validation or obedience from anyone. that is true equality  handling your own own business and letting others handle theirs. no one has the  right  to police others speech or thoughts  you and I included. we can discuss our thoughts openly and honestly and disagree vehemently but we can also respect one another s autonomy and keep it moving. to go beyond that is totalitarianism and oppression  a point that many fail to notice.
@patrick quick  or you could just respect someone and use the proper pronouns. its not that difficult. if you dont agree ok  you can disagree just be respectful. no one is forcing you to do anything  people are simply asking that yourespect their pronouns. if someone changed their name and asked you to call them by their new name you would. you wouldn t get upset and refuse. if you meet someone who asks that yourefer to them as they  just say they. does that really hurt you  again  if you disagree or dont understand non-binary or transgender individuals ok  thats how you feel personally. you dont have to agree to be respectful and kind.
@patrick quick  actually it is wrong and illegal to discriminate against someone. speech can and must be regulated.
@nola salazar barnes  there is a difference between respect and courtesy and people often conflate the two. courtesy is freely shown and given  respect has to be earned. secondly I do understand the topic quite well and that doesnt change my position in the slightest. I will not lie to someone else  for someone else  or ask them to lie for me to protect my own fragile ego. no one in this world owes you  and by that Imean every living person not you specifically  and you are not entitled to anything. kindness or respect is a bonus not a debt that you can demand. if someone says something I dont like to me I simply move along and take no notice of it because being an adult means being secure enough in your own self not to be so easily bothered by simple words. you know nothing about me  the things that Ive done  the horrors that Ive experienced as a medic in the military  the hardships that Ive lived through  the kindness that Ive shown  charity that Ive given  the lives that I have saved through my time in ems  or compassion that Ive demonstrated to people that the rest of society has cast out or looked down upon and yet you feel qualified to lecture me about what I  should  do. as I said before  our lives and responsibilities are our own  no one else gets to dictate how you live  think  or act.
@patrick quick  it wasn t a lecture  it was a statement and my opinion. clearly there s nothing I could say to youregarding this issue that would make any difference sadly. we should all have basic respect for each other and using a preferred pronoun isn t a huge request. it doesnt hurt me to say they so I do it  thats not a necessary battle for me. also  my culture recognizes two-spirit individuals like many other cultures have for thousands of years so its not hard for me to understand why someone would identify as non-binary.Im sorry for any trauma you ve experienced  I definitely understand trauma. I suffer from extreme anxiety and ptsd from sa and abuse from a parent who refused to get help for their mental illness. I never said you didn t have compassion  I just stated how I didn t think it was a huge issue to to respect someone s pronouns. it wasn t an attack on your entire character.
its people saying they are pan sexual because its more trendy then saying bI sexual
she really is.
@daniel n  its also because its a completely different thing
@ethan dalton  its the same shit tbh. its like trying to differentiate between lesbian and gay. its the same thing.
@mysteriuminiquitatis1998  isn t bisexual attracted to two or more genders  and pansexual is attracted to all genders
@nola salazar barnes  I understand that and having this discussion through text make it hard to decipher tone. I feel no antagonism towards you but I will always make my position clear. if we were actually speaking face to face my tone would be more matter of fact and emotionally neutral  just so you know  it wouldn t be me shouting like a lunatic or being aggressive. my past bears no weight on my shoulders and isn t a burden that I carry around  I included elements of it in my post to illustrate that I have lived a full and at times chaotic life with a wealth of experiences and lessons learned along the way. my opinions and views aren t just random stances that I pulled out of nowhere for the sake of being cruel or just to bash people over the internet.
this is so confusing to me because itseems to me that this creator and many comments seem to be policing emma s speech.  is emma not allowed to express themself  this is how they feel.  their one sentence inspired this video and hundreds of comments hoping to shut their words down. seems awfully hypocritical to me.  you cant cry  free speech  while trying to shut someone s speech down. it doesnt work that way.
@jsan  its because she is. as if it makes any difference in the world how someone feels about their own self. it doesnt. why is there a  common sense  video being made when they have no idea what they are talking about. common sense doesnt mean traditionalist.
being  polite  about chosen pronouns is all great and fine until there are actual consequences. a sexual assault victim should not be forced to call her male r@pist  she  or performatively pretend she was assaulted by a woman because the male r@pist simply wants her to. a woman should not be forced to share a prison cell with a male if she s uncomfortable  regardless of the males chosen  identity.  a lesbian should not have to pretend she desires male bodies just because it would make some woman-identifying males upset to hear thatshe actually doesnt. a woman shouldn t be forced to pretend a male who claims to have  woman feelings  is a real woman with experiences equatable to her own and concede every personal boundary and space to such males in service of the males personal beliefs.
@jsan  you have purposefully misrepresented my stance. I fully support the right of any person to say  feel  and think whatever they wish and have put myself in harms way to defend those freedoms. however it is a two way street  everyone else has the freedom not to listen or to ignore us entirely as is their right. emma has every right to express themselves and other people have every right to disagree.
@milque toaste  this is coming from a space that is so far from the actual reality that others are living in that you couldn t even possibly understand. just because you dont understand or agree with something  doesnt make it automatically correct for reasons that you suggest would happen. having someone use air quotes around how someone feels about themselves only further proves this point that people dont understand and dont want to  and assume that things should be common sense because they want things to be black and white  when the world doesnt work like that. no one would ask someone to pretend something about someone else.
@patrick quick  ok  but the same can be said for emma.  emma said one sentence about how they feel and what they re good at.  they didn t impose their feelings on anyone  it was a personal statement about how they feel.  thats all.  clearly that one sentence about how they feel caused this creator and many commentators to freak out and complain about their own right to free speech being challenged.  how emma did challenged anyone s free speech with that one little sentence about how they feel personally is beyond my comprehension and boggles my mind  but that is besides the point.  from an objective perspective I dont see anyone s right to free speech being challenged by emma but I do see how this uproar would challenge emma s  ability to speak freely about how they feel  which is just sad.  more specifically  the right to free speech refers to how congress can make no laws prohibiting  freedom  of speech.  how on earth does this apply to emma in this context  with the hundreds of negative hateful comments regarding them under this video  its quite clear the government isn t shutting down anyone s speech regarding emma or their gender identity.
@jsan  your assessment  while fair  is under my comment which was directed at a broader trend in society not the specific person being discussed. I have no issue with what emma said and even if I did I have a right to express it just like emma could express their disdain for my comment  this is equality. my comment and thread is directly aimed at those that wish to impose their will on others and try to force conformity of deed and thought  from any angle I will oppose and criticize them and will happily receive criticism in return  though I will always make sure to give as good as I get.
it is your responsibility to make people feel respected  but if you cant do that then emma d arcy is doing a heck of a lot better than you bigots in an irrelevant youtubers comments.
why do you feel the need to be so blinkered in your world view
@iain steele  why do you need to ignore biology and common sense
oh so you dont want people to use labels  like woman and man  interesting. emma is non binary. so basically no label. so basically the thing that you claim to miss. you miss itso much that you need to label them as a gender that you prefer on them. I know its hard for people like you to use common sense but cmon now..how do you not see the irony
@sin a  shh kiwI is right
@otaku the great  you couldn t prove me wrong so its safe to say that you both are unintelligent and I stay right.
@sin a  to be fair. your argument is a fallacy. she said she  missed those days ...referring to the zeitgeist. you are the one...specifically...that levied the straw man in your post claiming she said  you want everyone to use labels . forgive me kiwI for speaking on your behalf. but I think thier overall point was that people were less concerned about names and labels  than they are now. which is true. have a special day
@jaga the eldest  ironic considering the fact that kiwI lithium did the same. you dont miss the old days because people didn t use any labels  you just miss your own ignorance and people who s existence you disagree with being silenced.being non binary isn t a new thing. its not even a label. so many cultures have lived as non binary or with multiple different genders for centuries before colonization. some still do. your way of seeing gender isn t the correct way just because you say so. its just one out of many. if a concept this simple is so hard for you to grasp to the point where you build a wall around yourself to push away anything that might question the way you see the world  thats on you. not them. youre just being unnecessarily cruel and childish to people who will not negatively affect your life.
@sin a  oh and I would love an example of a society and culture that had something other than the male  female binary. just because you say it. doesnt mean its true...
@jaga the eldest  once again  very very ironic.
@sin a  ooohhh the cruelty...facts. oh the agony lol
@sin a  so...you dont have an example of a society that had something other than a male female binary  that was your statement. you said thats a fact.
@sin a  if you could debate me on facts...you would. it wouldn t be a string of emotional statements  and insults disguised as facts.
@sin a  im giving you all the chances in the world...
@sin a  fatality!
@sin a  I just did  so hush
@sin a  and you think you are smart... please  the 99.9  of us respectfully disagre with thatso sit down zip it  and dont reply again youre just clearly embarrassing yourself at this rate.
@otaku the great  wins!fatality
@otaku the great  tell em great one
@dio brando  not to be a glory hog but I finished...sin a. most of thier comments were removed  or deleted. they were just straight up bile...
@jaga the eldest   my comment only contained links to answer your questions and yet it was deleted by the freedom of speech army and declared a victory. the irony really wont stop
@otaku the great  goof
@sin a  I love how you dont know how to perceive irony in the correct context. your post were removed because they were attacks...not reasoned or civil debate. and you still haven t answered the question...oh the irony...
@jaga the eldest   your posts were removed   you still haven t answered the question  put 2 and 2 together man  also that comment wasn t an attack. it didn t even contain  bad  language. if its going to be removed there is no reason for me to even bother anymore dont you think  you and your boyfriends can celebrate that win! congrats! if you all agree on one thing youre obviously right
@sin a  so...you wont answer the question  got it. I would also consider the fact that  you wont defend your position by just answering honest questions. do links speak for you  are those your firmly rooted beliefs  you did manage to fire off a couple of sweet emojis though...thats got to count for something.and if you want  feel free to just answer the question...and if im wrong  I ll just say im wrong. no more complicated than that. good luck...
@jaga the eldest  bro cant even read
@sin a  deep bro
@jaga the eldest   its hilarious  how you stopped using irony after you didn t think the following comments contained any irony. that obviously means that the previous comments weren t ironic  yeah my position is represented very badly
@sin a  irony  irony.  irony  ...I smell irony...lmaoyou ll type irony all day long...but will not answer question.
@sin a  babality!
@jaga the eldest  -
@sin a  thats a very nice emojI  thank you precious.do you feel like telling me now...so I can be enlightened  oh...ive got an idea...try to string together some emojis in the form of an argument.
@sin a  irony though...
@sin a  so no answer
@sin a  animality!
@jaga the eldest  I wish you knew how goofy yall look
@sin a  from the person who speaks in emojis...so do you have an answer
@jaga the eldest  goof
@sin a  that was a subtle  and nuanced argument...any answer yet
@sin a omg... you literally dont even know your own beliefs. is that more terrifying or confusing for you
@jaga the eldest  answer  answer  answer  ...I smell answer...lmaoyou ll type answer all day long...but will not answer question
@jaga the eldest  omg...yea so terrifying or confusing
@sin a  beautiful arrangement of emojis...any answer yet  think of how great it would be to just really prove me wrong...go on. just one answer.
@jaga the eldest  any answers
@sin a  sorry precious...you did not represent well today. but there s always next time. and remember...its ok to say  I dont know ...there s no shame in it.
@jaga the eldest  no answer
@sin a  lol...Imade you devolve into complete childish mocking  and pictures. thats all you ve got.
@jaga the eldest  it must feel like looking into a mirror
@sin a  did...did you just say  I know you are but what am I  lmao goodbye
@jaga the eldest  did...did you just
@sin a  dont call yourself a goof
@jamie kelly  genuine question  what truth  because as Ive already told the others  gender is not just m   f. thats just one way of seeing gender. one way that was forced on other cultures as well. I gave them links as proof for cultures that had multiple or no genders but they were deleted so I wont try again but its very easy to look up so Im asking you to do that.so why do you think the westernized colonized way of seeing gender is the only correct one  or even the only one who deserves people s full and unconditional respect  also claiming that people like me are the reason why the world is intolerant and awful is truly mind-blowing. what part of your opinion am I supposed to consider and respect  people are being mistreated  bullied  harassed and even killed for being trans or nb but me not respecting peoples bigotry and disrespect is bad  be fr.I will repeat it once again  you miss the old days because thats when people you disagreed with were silenced.
@jamie kelly  also  they re not  going on about  it. not emma at least. when have they ever made a big deal out of it  are they not allowed to talk about it at all or what is your suggestion  nb people in general aren t making a big deal about it either. if people simply respected them and didn t constantly feel the need to fight it because they couldn t wrap their heads around an existence outside the one that they were taught  nobody would have to  go on about it . thatshould be common sense.
@sin a  heres an l. hold it.
@hugo stiglitz  are you a 14 year old boy  wdym hold it lmfaooo
thanks for speaking all this sense without being afraid of backlash. makes me also feel like speaking my mind where I usually stay silent.
youre just speaking truth that many others are thinking. I hope that you would not be persecuted for your beliefs and common sense but both history and modern day society tells us that this can very well happen. just know that you are not alone and whatever the future holds always stay true to yourself. please accept this small token of appreciation from someone inconsequential in another region of the country who just wants to be left alone to live a quiet life and have the opportunity to raise a happy family. thank you
Im so glad you still speak common sense. the ability to observe reality is what gives us the power to reason and determine truth for ourselves. if we lose the ability to reason  we will truly become animals and slaves.
I have honestly never heard the  insult to intersex people  point until you in this video. wow. thats more than a good point. how crazy is it that there s barely any education on intersex something biological and real  yet these miss frizzle ass tiktokers wanna come up and be like  let me teach you about hair pin pronouns  stumbled on your channel the other day and I really enjoy your videos and you voicing your thoughts! thank you
yes  stand up and let your voice be heard  melonie! people are too quiet about how they feel. time for the majority to take the power back.
very well spoken . I totally agree !
as a brit who admires your  common sense  and your attitude  you have my support too  melonie.  and Ive been a lara croft fan since she very first appeared  besides .
you made some damn good points and I know its a touchy subject to talk about. a small thank you
love this video melonie  you bring up a ton of valid points.  when you got to the video of the  dragon  pronouns I think my brain just went blah and I could not process what in the world that person was discussing or if itshould be taken seriously.  keep up the awesome content
yes!!!! thank you for being honest and saying the truth!!! this shit is absolutely insane
hell when I was a kid  I walked around in my cousins  high heels  cuz I wanted to feel taller lol  my aunt would always get mad at me and tell me to take them off cuz  they ll make you gay  its like... nnnooo lol I would also steal my cousins barbies cuz my gi-joes needed someone to help and protect
completely agree with you mac... I said the same thing last week on a fakebook post with the same headline. a woman playing a woman saying she s good at playing a woman... just simply insane. we shouldn t have to comply to another person s mental issues... no  we dont have to. the world will not give me access to tell people to call me whatever I d like to be called. I d like to be known as an adonis  but all I d get is folks rolling around on the floor in laughter! its just ridiculous.individuals should be allowed to live the way they wish  but dont demand the public automatically firstly know how or who you are or what ridiculous pronouns you want to be known as. there was the situation with a pro athlete that got questioned on her strength and gender. she honestly didn t know she had the rare medical condition thatshe had both equipment but had the male stronger genes but was by her own understanding thought she was a woman  she was also from a tribe that wasn t modern and didn t have modern medical access and her mother didn t talk about her situation. she was totally shocked when the authorities broke the information to her. it was so sad to see how she was oblivious to the situation. now with the whole gender neutral or switch nonsense in the modern world is just for a good portion broken hearted because of abuse or other mental break shouldn t be accepted by the greater population. there are those that want to win gold and have turned into a gollum character deciding to fluidly say they are women so they can dominate the course or the field to win gold. there are some very competitive people out there and because they aren t required to lose their junk before being accepted as a  woman  they can win gold and then after their wins they want they can just revert back.
I especially related to  we re expected to play along . well said melanie. I ll respect the individual when Im asked to respect their pronouns but  getting hate from people I dont even know because I failed to recognize their pronouns  is not something Im willing to play along with.
edit as melonie has just said something fantastic! - I just heard a perfect solution to the current issue of transgender and gender identities.if you dont force your beliefs and views on me  then in return I will at least give you tolerate and neutrality on the subject. even if it is something I dont agree with then I wont go out of my way to be cruel or hateful and as long as it doesnt infringe on my rights or free speech I will do my best to respect your wishes.original comment is actually a woman. calls herself non-binary. pats herself on the back for being good at playing a woman. simply existing as you are is not an achievement. now if she had framed it differently then it would have made more sense. say for example some of her roles ask for her to have a personality that is completely alien to her. then that would be the makings of a great actress. itsounds like she framed her statement as more of an activism speech instead of trying to celebrate her acting ability.
why does itseem like all the  slippery slope  arguments keep actually happening  love to see melonie sticking up for free speech and her beliefs. stay strong melonie. edit  lol I sent that before melonie brought up the slippery slope in the video.
melonie  you dont have to apologize. I have been watching you for 5 years now and you have been nothing but true and kind. if these people wanna call you names so what  your real fans know who you are.
I completely understand your argument of how pretending to be transgender and having issues for clout and status is insulting to an actual intersex individual. could you imagine someone going into a burn victim unit and pretending they are a burn victim because its how they feel  it would be absolutely insane. how insulting would that be to actual burn victims... its the same thing.
love your channel never give into the plagues of humanity stay strong keep speaking your truth.
I think youre spot on with this. it isn t about hate  but concern for how we live. if we want a society where people who were unheard are heard that implies they believe people should be heard. we can disagree with lifestyles  it doesnt mean we want to crush the lifestyle. however we can say we dont want that lifestyle for ourselves or our family.
keep being bold!  proud of you
yet melonie also denies reality when it comes to blair white which is really funny
what  common sense   she regurgitates generic right-wing talking points about every issue.
@horkbork m  commie
as a fellow brit you disappoint me  gaz. most of us are free of this typical american right wing crap.
@paul2377  right  cause blindly trusting any authority and following every progressive ideology like its the Bible is sooo much better
@fosmin clorin  where did I say  or even imply  I blindly trusted any authority or ideology  Im my own person - no one tells me what to think.
@paul2377  right  then I hope youre not a leftist
@paul2377  then why do you thing all right wingers are all believing in bs
@paul2377  and left wing crap like inthe vid!
@aisha alamoudi  maybe woke shows can be good if they are well written and not too obnoxious  I haven t watched it
@aisha alamoudi  and thats exactly what I said lol
@fosmin clorin  that clown is just here to bait  they left that identical comment over a dozen times on this one video
@aisha alamoudi  nah you lost
youre the best  thank you so much
thats hilarious. its too bad you didn t know as a kid  otherwise you could have come back with   high heels were originally made for men who played polo. women are gay.
was only logical for a young boy to get a girl for his big gI joe.  I had the gI joe jeep   my boy had to have a girl in his passenger seat.
you aunt was right tho
lol yep my dad gave me so much shit as a kid when I got a barbie to go with my gI joe  he ended up giving it away to one of my girl cousins  made me so sad. yet Im a straight man who s married lol the barbie didn t make me gay or trans
funny how even adults canthink things like high heels can affect sexuality haha. Im gay but never wore high heels or girl clothes. I played with toy cars  action man figures  video games  football etc. all the things boys are  supposed  to do etc. Im still gay. anyone would think those things had no effect on my sexuality.
@paul2377   I assume playing center was your favorite football position.
@browne hawk  Im in the uk  so what we call football  americans call soccer.
@paul2377  lol respect man  I tried my foot at soccer and it was brutal cardio. played football almost my whole life with no trouble  but damn  soccer takes some serious gas in the legs
all youre expected to do is be respectful. its really not that hard to refer to people the way they ask to be referred to.
the slippery slope is a slip and slid on a steep hill covered in ky lube.
its sad that I can actually see a lefty getting roasted on twitter for a bad take and then going to the burn unit.
some people pretend to be unable to use their legs and they use a wheelchair to larp as disabled.
@johnny kush  thats crazy. we are currently living in an episode of the twilight zone.. unfortunately its not a good one like the guy who had captured the devil but a bad one that just didn t work out and no one remembers or cares.
you didn t graduate high school  did you
@cris                 and youre allowed to have that opinion. you can decide for you and yours. Im glad you understand
in high school I had a pink shirt thatsaid  keep laughing this is your girlfriends shirt.   I got away with it for 1 day then they told me to take it off.
true intersex people are extremely rare but they do exist  and you bring up some very good points in regards to them.
you are so cute  and your opinions are a breath of fresh air. awesome woman!
well said. keep the great content and videos coming. God bless.
thank you melanie for being strong and saying what needs to be said.  we should be able to say what is obvious and troublesome. keep up the good work!
its sad how there s even a possibility of children having to think about their sexuality  when any parents with common sense knows that porn is not okay for a child to watch simply because parents believe their children are simply not mentally ready for that yet.yet how many children are having to deal with something that is now complicated to a point where I am not entirely sure that the  adults  even know what the hell is going on anymore basically I feel like everyone has lost their damn minds  am I crazy or is it everyone else   if they even had one to lose and we gave the inmates the keys to run the asylum on top of it.p.s. I am a new subscriber as of a few days ago and watching this I am glad there is at least one woman on this earth  hopefully there s more like you out there silently nodding  that actually sounds like they ve still got some sense left in your grapefruit.if it was possible  I would vote for you for president of the usa just so at least somebody has common sense in the white house  dead serious btw you spoke more sense to me in 26 minutes then I have heard in ten years and the whole time you spoke I heard the fear hesitation in your voice but you were still strong enough to upload itso thank you.good luck  God speed and may the force be with you melonie mac goes boom
this is why I keep getting therapy advertisements lol. this world is insane. dont let them silence you mel!
very well said!
it is a concern and Im glad to hear your opinion on the issue crisis  I had concerns about emma s  gender questions  as she quoted in interviews. its okay to have questions but its becoming unsafe and almost dangerous. education is an area in children s lives that is impacted by propaganda
one day I noticed I was having strange behaviors. 1  I like to look at girls  2  I enjoy the fight scenes in movies  3  I watched the notebook...once and regretted it ever since  4  I can sit in one spot for hours at a time thinking of absolutely nothing  5  farts make me laugh. confused by all this I went to the doctor and he she them said  you have all the symptoms of being a man . I asked how do you know  they said  you have a pen1s .
you just restored my faith in humanity s common sense    nuff said.
if these people stepped out of their own bubble and looked at all the real suffering going on around the whole planet they d realise these non issues really are meaningless
thank you for your courage. Im one who is too afraid to speak out because I know I will be labeled as intolerant. you are speaking for so many  but you are the one taking the backlash. I thank you  madam!
I feel the same. I ll always respect people and their choices  however there s lines that cant be crossed that are being crossed. for example  kids being indoctrinated and put on hormone blockers and get surgery before they re consenting adults. parents are the ones that will be held responsible by their own kids in the future. my pronouns are  sick  and  tired  of all this.
thank you mel for speaking the truth!
respect sister
we thank you for voicing your thoughts  dont be afraid to upload these videos.
bro  this is getting soo crazy. we got you girl  stay up
I like to see you without with little make-up  melonie. beautiful.
God bless you  for bravely speaking out  for common sense.
so well said!
if more people dont start speaking out soon they ll wish they did when it is too late
dont be afraid to speak out dude. your bravery can bring out the bravery of others. when people see movements in numbers  they begin to speak their piece
paid comments  I didn t know this was a thing
@digitalalpha  if you press the  thanks  button you can donate to a channel and it ll show the amount you donated in your commment
@eritreanchic  nah I dont see a thanks button and I doubt I have that option in my region because from my country I cant super chat or become channel member so I doubt I have this option either
she might get a bit of backlash  but judging by the comments  most people who watch these videos agree with her. plus with all the views she gets  and donations such as yours  she s making a good living off all this. so I wouldn t feel too sorry for her!
first they came for the socialists  and I did not speak out because I was not a socialist.then they came for the trade unionists  and I did not speak out because I was not a trade unionist.then they came for the jews  and I did not speak out because I was not a jew.then they came for me and there was no one left to speak for me. martin niem llernever be afraid to speak up out!be brave fom a centrist humanist!
but if someone said  I identify as a tree  everyone would not respect their choice. its just not right. transgender is in that category but we are made to feel like its a crime to questuion. just like how she said  its gaslighting our common sense
I think she does have some makeup  but the eyeliner is missing.
I learned long ago once something begins  it must run its course. Im old enough to see these patterns in society and whatever the flavor of the moment is  it always passes for the next big thing. life is a parade and some floats are better than others.
glad I ran across this channel.  good luck keep up the great work!
you are an amazing woman. thank you so much
I just found your channel. keep up the good work!
I cant agree with you more  mel. I am roughly 10 years older than you and when I was growing up in the early 90 s  none of this crap was an issue. no racism  no sexism at all from my crowd of friends  and if there was  we wouldn t put up with any of that  and I was pretty much Christian conservative even back then. so wtf is this now  you know  growing up I thought we were passed all that crap.as far as the woke crap  you are right  why should we have to go out of our way to accommodate those folks that  demand  we treat them a certain way  this is the political divide. you must bow to them. screw that crap. us on the right might be more willing if y all were just regular people about it instead of being effing children throwing temper tantrums  even if we disagree fundamentally. respect is earned... just sayin
yes!!! finally someone said it!!! you my hero!! never stop
great video girl  youre great!
I used to like a lot of girl stuff much more then guy things as a kid. went on shopping a lot with girls as a teen because I liked that  no  not for paying the bill . yet I still am a real man and happy to be one as an adult. if I lived as a kid now I would have lost my balls  thats just sick!
youre perfect.  I couldn t agree more with the majority of your opinions.
this is one of your best videos and the message you are sending by not bending to their will is inspiring to me. please keep fighting this fight  I am rooting for you. thank you. God bless.
give that person an acadamy award. what an astounding portrayal! I fully believed I was watching a woman! I d have never known the difference if not for the bravery of the person behind the top notch performance!
it almost like we re in an actual war for reality .thats the stuff of sci-fI and we re living it! Im neo! claimed it!
I used to think the  attack helicopter  thing was just a strawman  but Ive seen so many examples in recent years of people unironically identifying as things that are just as absurd  dogs  cats  deer  robots  fairies  fictional characters  Ive even seen some individuals who tried to identify as more than one person.
I opened this video just for me to be like you look different...... then I saw it was her hair and I could see her face more. it looks good in my opinion.
been watching your channel for about a week now. I think I like it quite a bit. you seem very intelligent  and I agree with your perspectives. there are so many folks on youtube that are so damn woke  I cant watch it. people trying to redefine websters dictionary is very annoying  and destructive. champion on melonie!!
Imiss when   I dont adhere to labels  was trendy.
we ve truly entered the world where common sense is a real superpower.
going the road of calling people a bigot  sexist or racist for having curiosity or questions is just an easy way to shut down a conversation they dont want to have.
just here to voice my support. I appreciate everything youre doing  please continue to voice the truth. hard to find girls as pretty as you and also with the smarts to match.  please excuse the weird compliment  but seriously tho. anyway  just keep it up.
you tell them melanie. you should be able to speak your mind and Im glad youre here to do it.
lol
frankly  I think its offensive thatsomeone who isn t a woman would steal a woman s role from actual women.
@sam seidman  well Imean acting is acting  technically anyone can play a role if they can play it exceptionally.
btw if I identifying as a bear  can I hibernate and still get payment and keep my job
I identify as a billionaire. send me money or be transphobic  s
how have any of these people personally affected you or your life  exactly  they haven t you just want to hear yourself talk.
I didn t put on eyeliner today  I think thats the biggest change since I normally wear a lot of it haha. and thank you
there s a lot of people whom dont share the same views. I choose to not engage. trying to force others to engage has gotten us where we are today.
a conversation they dont want to have because its a conversation they ve already had dozens of times.this kind of thinking is so naive lol. its like thinking that queer people dont want to argue with you on why they should have rights because they cant logically defend their position that they should have rights  when in reality this is a conversation that has been had a million times we shouldn t be expected to have a whole dialogue about it everytime a tory wants an explanation as to why we should have rights...
I agree
@dorian gray stanley ipkiss agrees with you agree with her.
speak your mind  - unless you say something that offends conservatives lmao
Im so glad to hear someone saying the same stuff I do...... keep on fighting lol
God damn you are a breath of fresh air in the miasma of shit we have a breathe in each day and then get told it dont taste bad keeping fighting the good fight we got your back
they wanna turn everyone into narcissists
love the vids girl keep em up
your videos are fantastic!
I get your point Im like you but a guy who likes girl stuff has pretty much all female friends all my life. also glad because if I was a kid today someone would want me to be a women. then again when I was a kid I was called gay  beat up. but also used that to get close to women and sleep with them  including some of my bullies gfs . also nothing against trans people even have a friend who s one. and he even agrees that kids shouldn t do that and even waited till he was in his 20s till he did stuff like surgeries.
I could not have agreed with anyone more.  people really have issues that you have explained.  itsucks that others who probably dont know who they are.....are being told who they are.
boom! what s happening to these kids is nightmare fuel. just watch one of blaire s de-transition interviews...if the sadness  regret and horror on display doesnt affect you  youre one of the lost
I am a demiGod. if you dont see me as such  you are evil. respect my identity
thank you for being a voice of reason
well done mel! I think dave chappelle summed it up best with the quote  to what extent do I need to participate in your self image  like mel I try to understand that people are having an experience which I do not understand....however I have reached the point where I see this is delusional narcissistic gaslighting  laced with potent spite
fyI you look great with light makeup  even better in my opinion. keep killin it and speaking your mind!!!
hello I just found your content over this weekend and you make some good points keep up the good work and Ive known a lot of tom boys and they are some of the most down to earth lady s you can ever meet thanks and good luck
you hit the nail on the head when you described it as being trendy. its a trend thats being forced on us as a whole but especially being aimed at kids by the media and hollywood. its not something that is naturally happening and the worst part of this mess is that its making it harder for people who actually have gender dysphoria.
love...love your show melonie!
preach melonie preach!! Im glad to hear a solid voice of reason in a world full of shaky  terrified voices.
I know Im late to the video  but I love the vibe of proper discussion. I ll watch the video and if anyone finds me in this wide sea of comments  I ll be happy to discuss my opinions on this. for context when I finish the video  Im very involved in the trans and whatnot community.
great video! I agree 100 !
well said
I agree with your pushback on this subject well done
I saw that  it broke my heart
what a time to be alive
very well said. as a Christian who tries to be compassionate and Christlike  there are definitely undercurrents of being held hostage by layers of absurdity.
Im not into all the pronouns stuff but just thinking of being a dragon almost get s me.then I remember who the dragon is and who the woman is and it all makes sense.lol
credit where its due  I thought her replacing the younger actress would kill the shore for me  but she has been excellent.
melonie is just looking amazing with little to no make-up. g4 could have been on top of the world of they hired her! she is perfect tomboy!
I grew up with nothing but sister and Im a straight  cis  man  and its mostly trying to fit in for those with more family members of the opposite sex to try to fit in or parent they or trying to receive favor from. it may not be gander dysphoria it might just be attention seeking like you said
go girl!  I feel its our duty to point out the absurdity of the situation until they allow us to  since censorship is growing by the day. and its not a battle against the individual  they are free to act and feel how they like  its a battle against the ideology  against them pushing this nonsense to kids  first and foremost  and all of us and our culture too. and as someone else saud  youreally look good without eyeliner  which I think I said maybe once in my entire life. so there s thst!
yes  this whole situation has got waaaaay out of hand! I have a friend who s  offspring   has decided they re non-binary. they ve changed their name to a more neutral  but more masculine one  and prefer  they them . ok  I ll respect their choice. the first time Imet them was before this change happened  but ok. even their mum occasionally refers to them as  she  but they haven t ever spoken up about it and pointed it out. so fair play with that.on the other side of this coin though Im middle-aged from a simpler time lol I ll keep this pg   if its got male genitalia  its a dude  if it doesnt  its a girl . enough said.you keep on speaking your truth  melonie. it makes sense to me
the more a society diverts from the truth  the more it will hate those who speak it.  -george orwell
they are the people that are supposed to believe in understanding the most  but when you show concern about something as important as literally altering your body in a procedure you cant ever come back from  suddenly you are all the phobes in the book  but then when someone who actually went through the process also shows the same concerns they are also labeled all the phobes because we are all expected to just go along with it. but no we have to speak out and while being understanding that not all cases are the same as you mentioned  sadly some are just  woke up today feeling like a plant  so now Im a plant   that is where things go from understanding to clearly something isn t right.
completely agree with your point of view. keep speaking your mind.
unfortunately melonie there will always be persecution but dont let it discourage you. here s why  when they persecute you that means your doing something right. Jesus even said that people hated him and they will hate us for his names sake. so stay strong in the faith and in the Lord Jesus and never let your strength weaken
Im with yu on this. world is getting wild
never bend the knee to the woke mob.God bless you sister in Christ
you are so correct. loving your takes and no simpin  lol.
no one can make you feel inferior without your consent
that natural look is next level damn
thank you for speaking out on this topic! its a huge concern of mine and Im constantly feeling the gaslighting when being told by people I talk to who dont already know the extent of this issue that I am blowing it out of proportion. found you through friday night tights and you ve got a new fan
youre great keep it up
yo... I just got to put this out there and I apologize in advance if this is inappropriate  but oh well.   dont misunderstand me when I say this because Ive always found the way you do your makeup to be sexy  but damn!!! now that I see you without makeup  or more minimual makeup  your are freaking gorgeous!!!....  that is all.
we all use pronouns  no
@hannah  I think they re referring to neopronouns
I hate to break it to you bud  but she s wearing quite a lot lol
@user.equalto.null  not trying to be mean but uh......yeah
little to no make-up  haha what video did you watch
@user.equalto.null  Im not wearing a lot at all. light coverage foundation  a very tiny bit of mascara on the top lashes only  lip tint like 70  washed off  and a little blush and brown tint. this is considered light makeup.
@melonie mac go boom  I think many girls in my class used to wear this type of makeup to school as well  even thought school rules forbade makeup. I had considered doing the same because of my acne.
@user.equalto.null  actually she really isn t wearing much. its there tho
oh no  they re trying to make kids more accepting and inclusive of other people  how terrible!
I cant believe how sad a life it would be if this is a huge concern of yours
you must not have nephews nieces  cousins or other children in your life to care about then because this gender confusion is only one of many ways we re setting up the future for failure.
I ll tell you what  Im really good at playing middle-aged bald men  even though I self identify as a 20 something adonis. its just my special talent I guess.
its the 2020s  we re not supposed to have opinions. but if the left is really gonna call us  evil  then I will gladly embrace that evilness.I hope people like you dont stop what youre doing. we need more people like you
keep up the good work!  o
my question with they them is what people who identify as it do when they learn a new language. I speak german  my wife is polish. neither I nor my wife canthink of a word in either that would work to represent they them without completely breaking the language and making it unintelligible. to the best of my knowlege  english is likely the only language that can get away with it.
never be afraid to speak your mind. its your life to leave to the fullest.
I honestly feel hermaphroditis that are going through hard times
you nailed it on the head melonie!... something wrong in the head.  instead of getting the proper help they need they are self diagnosing...  I also believe there are some serious mommy and daddy issues as well.  its like they are desperate for the attention  desperate to feel special and be different...
that was refreshing to hear.
when youre called all the bad things  you know youre doing the right thing
dont know how Imissed your channel before now  but this one sold me.  subbed!
yay for discord notifications. I do think melonie looks amazing without the makeup too.
I always live by.   fuck their feelings.
I think my main issue is when I hear someone say something like  Im a man trapped in a woman s body  or vise verse I question what that means. are you attracted to other women  do you just like dressing  more masculine   its just strange because how can you know youre a man in a woman s body if you ve never been a man  maybe you just like things that are traditionally attributed to men. I just think conversation would save a lot of people undergoing surgeries or inventing other methods for them to just become comfortable with who they are. the speed at which some people are willing to alter themselves chemically or surgically also scares me a bit  at time it just seems like the decision is made with the wrong mindset when making life altering decisions. idk.
youre doing a good job  young lady. keep up the good work.
holy crap  youre speaking my thoughts precisely
dont stop.  keep it up.  here s some thoughts for you and your viewers.a stroke survivor battles his handicap visiting a coffee shop  where the server is confused -- the server sees an inarticulate person that cant manage a simple order  drunk  stoned  stupid  etc ... of course this isn t going to go well.  but what if the server is familiar with people like just wanting to learn how to regain some independence  just wanting to belong  just hoping to connect.  now we can maybe see a server demonstrate patience  putting extra effort to make the connection  with the key phrase being  extra effort .when our children and grandchildren dont line up with the expected behavior patterns  the go to response is there s something wrong with the child.  seems these children are always surrounded by people who are not putting the extra effort in  either because they re untrained or maybe they really just dont care.  but so often the parents  teachers and leaders that offer the simplest little amount of extra effort  dont have as many  problem  children.  they discover the differences create a unique young adult.so I agree with melonie  primarily because Ive met too many individuals that have been helped to discover who they actually are.  and they didn t need unnecessary surgery to accomplish this  they did not have to use random pronouns and screwed up labels to further damage their spirits and have them expelled from mainstream society.  we cannot abandon our young people to to this style of failed thinking.  everyone deserves the opportunity to learn who God intended them to become  without the corruption of physical abuse or mental abuse or a society that wants to say  since you dont  feel  right then you must need to become something else--take a pill  or have surgery.  its just heartbreaking.
people that want to be the opposite gender are simply confused and need professional help in my opinion. instead of telling people a long time ago that they re not harming anyone and they re just doing it to themselves  itshould ve been looked as a serious mental disorder or problem   I feels sad for people that cant embrace their sexuality
my girl! this is obviously relevant to everyone. keep spreading your opinion  common sense is contagious.
my 3 year old son says he s the bumblebee from the transformers. as his parent its up to me to tell him that its pretend. these people never had their parents say  no  to them.
I hope you will always stand up for yourself and your opinion.

imo  I think melonie looks much prettier as she is on this video  without all the extra makeup.
I wish I could retweet this xd
its simple. what youre describing is  gender dysphoria   a recognized psychiatric illness in the dsm 5. basically  it manifests as severe distress revulsion at the sex-based characteristics which you possess  breasts or lack thereof  body hair  genitalia  facial features  etc. etc. . its important to note  that medically speaking  transitioning  via surgeries and cross-sex hormones  is both the only treatment which is proven to work for properly diagnosed gender dysphoria  but it is also only for gender dysphoria. as a result  many people who want to self-id as trans  without having the actual symptoms  have campaigned against this traditional medical definition  calling their adversaries  truescum    transmedicalists   gatekeepers   and many others that have largely become irrelevant due to successfully browbeating anyone who questions self id as valid.tl dr they re talking about feeling like distressed about their sex primary and secondary characteristics. in a tiny fraction of the population  transitioning is medically necessary. there are many crazy lefties who have convinced people that anyone cantransition  without meeting the medical standards  which is what will ruin the lives and futures of so many  and likely make things difficult for people who genuinely need that treatment
thatsounds like reasonable questions. shhhhh youre not supposed to ask blahhjjh
@user.equalto.null  yup  thats why it needs to not be taboo to investigate why people want to do things. ultimately people should be free to do what they want but this is quickly becoming more than that. it just traces back to people becoming obsessed with their own  truth  and actual conversation being replaced by both sides lobbing slogans and rhetoric at one another.
@user.equalto.null  I dont think  transition  is actually medically necessary. the dysphoria is a psychological disassociative condition and should be treated like a psychological issue. which should of been the main focus of the mental health care system to begin with... if they actually wanted to help they would have developed program that cantreat the trauma at its roots  just like they would have with other psychological issues. but nowadays all there s its affirming centers... this body modification gender identity cult is all a business to this big corp s.
dont question  just consume more product.  s
we have the same questions. and that point exactly too. how do you know you are trapped with the wrong body if you have no recollection or meaningful experience of being the other  so I also ask if they just meant societal expectations. same with the non-binary. what do you mean you are neither of the binary  societal expectations aside  we all do the same things to live. so Im not sure what it means in any meaningful context.
@heron colby  transition is 100  necessary for people who genuinely feel bad in their body and dont want to live that way. its like trying to make a gay person straight. you can make them  normal  but not without breaking their mind. they would never be able to live a happy life again.
@google user  people with anorexia  severe depression and even body dysmorphia get better with psychotherapy  there s already thousands of gender dysphoric people that have overcome it with psychotherapy. yes it takes time  year s to battle multiple emotional trauma s but its been done. so its not necessary.. also homosexuality is not a psychological disassociative condition  nor is a self inflicted emotional trauma. they may share a cultist community but they re not related whatsoever.
its simple. they think being a man is all about your hair  shave your hair to become a man and stare like a psycho at people
@heron colby  thats been tried for decades  but sure  it ll work this time . there s a massive difference between  affirmative care  and actual treatment and evaluation  which has  as stated in my first comment  been the only treatment that has worked for that tiny minority of people for many decades  i.e. before the current craze .its foolish to form opinions about medicine as a layman  because medicine is extremely complicated and doctors are really the only people qualified to have opinions about treatment. you can have idle musings about potential treatments  as we all do  but as soon as you accept those idle musings as what doctors  should do  you have become the victim of the dunning-kruger effect. especially when that opinion is about someone else s medical care.also  anorexia and dysmorphia are both completely separate and different diseases from gender dysphoria  and therefore its irrational to assume that they share the same treatments. here s that dunning-kruger effect again.
@user.equalto.null  it was tried and it worked. its a long treatment but its better than to disassociate the person even further by affirming their condition. also  the reason you may not know that it worked its because  from what I heard  all of the record s and recommendations of clinician s that worked on this patients for decades was thrown out the window by the new medical  t ans  health care institution s. also care to highlight how different are the psychological disassociative issues Imentioned to gender dysphoria  because from my observations they re all rooted in a form of self hatred  self denial or coping mechanism.
I keep asking how other women think. transwomen say they think like women but as far as I  a woman  cantell we dont think alike. I and other women have a variety of thoughts on all subjects. so I guess in thatsense they do think like women but thats because thats how humans think!
@heron colby gender dysphoria for the record is not considered a medical llness and hasn t been considered one for sometime. the thing is  transitioning for many people is necessary. the problem comes when people try to push it on those who dont need it. there are people who never get over the feeling of not feeling in the right body and it works for them. I think people are too quick make that decision when it come to children who indeed might feel confused but it is something that they can grow out of. you have people that live their whole lives and realize its not working out and they still transition much later in life. and the thing is these people have always been around. we just didn t have the medical advancements to make these things possible untill the last hundred years. trans people so exist. dysphoria is real.but at the speed and amount that is showing up these daysm now that is a different story and worth talking about. because al ot of these kids going around thinking they re trans alot of them really aren t.
it not something you personally need to think about so hard so I wouldn t worry about it.
no one wants to converse  or at least actually listen to one another. these days its more like different groups of people huddled around megaphones pointing at each other from across a field. these are great questions  the problem is no one actually wants to talk to anyone who feels this way to get an answer.
preach  girl.
I collected barbie as a boy and I still grew into a full grown man
Im not a terf... Im just te
I seriously dont understand why people take the non binary thing seriously. I too find the glorification to be incredibly concerning. when you see these types of people you will get people pandering telling them they re beautiful when they clearly aren t. Im convinced that this ideology takes advantage of the vulnerable eg those who have suffered sexual abuse and also there seems to be a trend of those with autism falling for this stuff since they understand they are different and this gives them a reason. the way I see it  if youre not allowed to call something out  that makes it even more of a threat. the saddest part is that the gaslighting is an attempt to shame people who are more sympathetic. it would be way easier to just say that they re invalid and completely reject them in the same way they reject others  but a lot of us still want to humanise them and be moral. at some point  people are just going to stop caring altogether. too much energy is being spent in a way to divide us instead of realising that perhaps we should be focusing on those who intentionally do this.this culture where emotional security is dependant on complete strangers is so incredibly unhealthy.
because I want to be rich and magical  that means Imust be rich and magical!
I think emma got a point! I for example am very good at having my period
its been out of hand since the very beginning. we need to just say no to all of it.  being nice  only enables insanity.
I know youtube gives me what I wanna hear  but hearing someone making so much sense  about so many topics  within such short videos really helps to defuse my anger a few notches. the most difficult part of living these days is having the constant feeling of being alone fighting the  common sense  fight against an emotional  irrational  hateful and ever growing assholes on a witch hunt against those sodomites cis-heretics who dare to question the ways of the woke.
love you girl  great content. subbed!!!
my new favorite channel. good stuff mmgb!!
absolutely and completely agree with you! it really does come down to whether or not a person has any pride in who they are. this nonsense of pretending to be  or  identifying as  someone else or something else is ridiculous enough when adults are doing it  but to promote this stuff to children is taking it too far. thanks for speaking out!
I agree with you 100   mel. right now the schools where Im from now have litter boxes in the bathrooms  because some students identify as cats. I truly believe there are serious mental health issues that need to be addressed.
I agree with you. you are a very wise person.
well said. never watched a video of you before  just found it today. about the matter  the daughter of my girlfriend is 14  and she and her friends claim to be non binary too. its soooo hard for me to not just show disrespect to her  because she says some really stupid things about that. but I took the time to ask her what she thinks non binary is. she  if I feel female today I am  if its cool to be male the other day  I am  but I like to be male more. and I like male to be my boyfriends so that makes me non binary and gay....me  wtf....besides the fact thatshe cant know what its even mean to be a real woman at the age of 14  its very clear that this is just a trend for these kids  but a dangerous one. I tried to explain to her that liking the same gender or both  or feeling youre in the wrong body is not the same as just fabricate a new gender because its cool. male and female are things that exists. sometimes it happens that a mind is in the wrong body  yes  but the 2 genders do exist. what you and your friends are doing  does not.in school  some of the teachers dont even know her real name  because she just tell them a fake male name. she got short hair now  she likes more boy clothes  hoodies etc  so a foreigner cant tell in the first moment if she is male or female. imagine teachers call you on the phone because something school related happen and you dont know who they talk about because of the wrong name....its ridiculous.
10 37 there was an interview about dave chappelle s special  sticks and stones   where a trans woman criticized his chinese in the wrong body joke  saying  oh thats such a tired joke I wake up as something wacky   btw way to underhandedly call chinese people wacky   and now look at ollie  Im korean now  london
this is the first video Ive seen on your channel. you had me hooked as soon as I heard your intro about freedom of speech and not being cancelled. go girl! you are so right. itshould be against the law for anyone under 18 to be given any opposite sex hormones or have life altering sex change mutilating surgery. when people claim that there aren t just 2 genders and instead gender is a spectrum  they are dead wrong. there are only 2 biological sexes  and there are only 2 genders. masculinity and femininity is a spectrum. some girls are very feminine and some are more masculine  but that doesnt make them a man. some men are more masculine and some are more feminine  but that doesnt make them a women.
looking great in your video today! youre wonderful at playing a women as well lol
God bless you melonie great video
brave and stunning
as a man there s not one day I dont contemplate  ending my life to escape the women in my life .
my male cousin played with dolls as a kid  his mom never questioned it or looked into it as anything other than normal and she bought him dolls and barbies without hesitation. he grew up to be a masculine straight man. people need to just let kids be kids
@melonie mac go boom  isn t part of being a kid asking questions  though  why is it bad if a kid asks what non-binary is  for example if they learn about gender identification when they re younger  it will be normalised for them. so maybe when they go through puberty and dont feel comfortable identifying as a boy or a girl  because thats just how their brain is wired   they ll realise that maybe they re non-binary too  and that that is perfectly normal.if a kid learns about what being non-binary is  grows up and does feel comfortable as their assigned gender  well  its not effected their life  but it may make them more tolerant to people who are non-binary.
people who identify as cats do not represent an entire community  sir. judge them if it helps you sleep at night but dont come for everyone.
minds cant be in the wrong body. minds are in their body and form accordingly based on that body. we all  every single one of us  have unique minds.
that was a good joke  some people just lack sense of humor and another sense that I will not mention to avoid getting myself in trouble
they aren t interested in your understanding melonie  they want your compliance. its a game  they demand you play.
considering the direction thatsociety or the world has been headed in as of the late  characters like the comedian from the graphic novel   the watchmen  are beginning to make more and more sense everyday that passes. the is becoming a complete show! smh
insanity is insanity. it doesnt matter how much you want it.it doesnt matter how much effort you put into your presentation.it doesnt even really matter how hot you look  before or after.you are what you are  man or woman. and it doesnt matter how many surgeries you take  or how many people say different.you will never be a different sex than what you are now.
personally I identify as a blanket... a dragon blanket
sad when you cant even talk about something thatshould be so easy to understand  because youre afraid that crazy people will come after everything you have. well from the comments itseems that there are more level headed people out there then not. so thats refreshing.
well said
this is what happens when parents spoil their children.  they grow up to be  adults  who think disagreeing with them   hating them.
I appreciate this blog  I hope you will still be on youtube after this one!
amen  that is all I can say.
hImelonie  Im an old guy that always supported minorities   a leftist as you called it in usa   I fight side with feminists  gay community   and of course working class where I come from    in my country we didn t had racial issues back in the day   late 70s and full 80s   we have them now but anyway   I always tried to be an open human being   respecting people in the same way I want to be respected   same as their opinions and political views   but this thing is out of hand is total craziness   its a trend for kids    teenagers and woke people  and its being heavily promoted from people  with enough power to make it possible    I dont know why   the only reason it comes to my mind its to destroy from inside the western society  and its moral and values   just to start with another phase of  something   it can be    trans humanization   with companies creating prosthetics and gadgets to substitute parts of the human anatomy   or even to hack the brain   or maybe to go for a genetic control of population   making a weak model citizen unable to demand nothing from people in power   idk   it can be anything   but for sure this is not some random thing   this is heavily pushed and that is the scary thing of it    more when they want to go after kids and  take the parents out of the equation
you look beautiful without eyeshadows too
speak it loud! I agree!
its ridiculous and at the point that if you even point out the most silly things  people get upset that you aren t going along with the absurdity.  she can play a woman well... because she s a woman.  there is nothing wrong with pointing out the truth.
beautiful
youre awesome.
social media was humanity s worst mistake.
as someone who lives in loony liberal california I felt that line  Im gonna get so much backlash for this  moments I go through them everyday I go out  even worse working in retail is not any easier.
I love your pov. I agree on most  issues.
I tried to identify as all the genders on facebook.  I was adding them to my profile but facebook said I could only add 10. how rude! I swear Im at least 11 and thats me being generous.
yes. they prey on peoples desire to be  nice  and get along.
hello  Im looking for some arguments in a good way  friendly debate so we can both get a perspective .are youreferring to the celebrities and media using these labels to get people to watch it or transgender people as a whole pushing you to comply with them
@junebug  quacks looking to take advantage of the emotional or mentally unbalanced should affect us all.the answer to body dysphoria is not self mutilation.
these times will end up being another odd footnote in history.
spoken like someone who had a traumatic childhood
@ethan dalton  lol  you think being disagreed with is traumatizing
@vic 2.0  no. Ive probably misinterpreted your comment  but it is the sort of thing people say who claim they turned out perfectly fine after being beaten by their parents when growing up
@ethan dalton  I think thats quite a leap. Imean  I didn t even mention physical discipline at all.  but discipline in general  yes  very important.
@vic 2.0  well thats probably because physical discipline isn t a thing. the word youre looking for is abuse.
@ethan dalton  I disagree  but that isn t anywhere near the topic as Ive explained.  and I think its telling that you  take  disagreement  and think of physical abuse.  safe to say you missed the point by a mile.
@vic 2.0  well at least we re both clueless  so thats something.
@ethan dalton  speak for yourself.
I agree I also feel like its really baiting. like she or they must be full on aware of what she said and know people will react to that in this way. or maybe its just lack of self awareness kind of a common thing in hollywood now.
did she play male roles btw
@mathieu s.  lol  doubtful
lmao imagine playing what you are and still in denial smh
people like her dosnt see it that way..
@mr dot1  yeah they see the world through a clown lens
unchecked childhood ego brings us the modern self-worship cult. its also guaranteed to bring to the world the murderous God complex if they remain in power. the dark abyss of the mind has been staring back at them for a while now.
reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
@roach  I think emma is trying to reach young people who are confused and suffering from that confusion  so very much a sense of awareness knowing that there will be backlash but still wanting to show kids that they can express their gender however they want without needing surgery
tbf I think most people would get annoyed and upset if someone insisted on calling them something they re not.
@ethan dalton  depends on the context
she  was a woman. she doesnt identify as that any more  and forcing her under that label is just mean. but I agree thatshe has lived the female experience  although perhaps a bit detached from it   which is why her statement is a bit of a reach.
@nina  so is she a man now
mel went boom on this one!
one thing s for sure is that the name callers dont have much of a an eye for personal responsibility.
well said!
I agree that kids shouldnt be given the tools to change their sexual idenity.but I also think that if an adult wishes to identify as they them instead of a woman  then thats their right and itshould be respected. nothing wrong with making jokes  just be aware thatsometimes those jokes can hurt someone s feelings  even if its unintentional. it all just comes down to respect.
watching someone eat butter is hard for for me  but I do agree with you... for the most part.  p
my friend andy transitioned after his marriage broke up. she decided to leave this world a few years later and I still wonder if just accepting the sudden change and not questioning him her about what she was going through seriously for fear of seeming like a bigot to a good friend cost them their life...
thank you. go boom!
my partner doesnt like his name. has nothing to do with gender  he just has never identified with his given name. totally hated it growing up. so he goes by a chosen nickname. he picked the nickname later in life. I have a cousin who does the same.not identifying with the identities that are given to us isn t just applicable to gender. now imagine that feeling of being forced to be something you dont feel like  you   cranked to 11 with your gender. thats about as close as I can explain gender dysphoria.
if it looks like a duck  walks like a duck  and it talks like a duck.... then you probably know what it is  doesnt matter if it identifies as a goose  or a swan or some other kind of water fowl. we all know what it is.
girls who are tomboys  and boys with sensitive natures are a common good. let kids be kids. they ll have more than enough time to overthink things when they get older.
thank you for uploading this
this weird pronoun shit only exists on tiktok and online.  Ive never met anyone who had weird ass pronouns.  but then again  I am over 30  jk  Im on my 3rd year as 29  so you d be hard pressed to find crap like this in an adult work environment  that isn t some up start tech company  lol
my belief is that we should be normalizing people being able to be honest about what they were born as and people making a respectful choice based on that. if its not what they re into  politely reject. expecting to be  passing  isn t really a sane approach
its more like they are in a cult they will absolutely not listen to anything outside of the cult and its doing nothing but harming people that have true problems and they are also literally sacrificing children for their cause and I highly value your opinions   boom on....
I ll say  adult you  looks damn good!
good point about them not really being fixed. nearly every transgender person I know  even after transitioning is still incredibly insecure and constantly finds the need to keep validating themselves
am I a terrible person because one of my biggest concerns is that they re going to do away with urinals   why do I have to worry about such a thing
always a pleasure to listen to a fellow sane reasonable woman. cheers.
Im glad there are still people like you who point out the trash where they see it
so glad I found this channel
I hope you can get to a place where you dont beat yourself up over it  it wasn t your fault. its a delicate thing to try to navigate with loved ones  feels lose lose regardless of your stance on it. Im so sorry for your loss  but thank you for sharing your experience
well the problem is that a person like you  thatstill doesnt know if it was a he or a she and still likes to play the game  wouldn t have been able to do anything anyway. also a good friend would have taken the chance without even thinking about it.  so rest in peace and keep playing games.
so there shouldn t be a problem with trans kids then
@captain hurricane  so many people out of nowhere are they them now. its a trend
@captain hurricane  mutilate herself ... are you talking about a man or a woman
I received a business card from a person I was working with at my bank. on that business card in addition to name and title were their preferred pronouns.  so.
ive seen it but its more so like a role they go along with ive never seen any of them demand to be called anything other than he or she and they them. they more so do it in their circles and dont really bring it up unless you get to know them as you learn about them. im 28. im not sure about any other pronouns but I know in my great purple  state we do have to call co workers she he or they them but I dont think wed have to do anything else. ive noticed though living all over  greater new england does seem to have more trans people in general but not so much they thems or idk what else there is lol dragons and cat people
@a s  they always existed  they just have a voice now
I feel passionately about my hatred for pasta. I ll make sure that every person I see knows that I hate pasta and I ll also inform them that if they dont respect my feelings of hating pasta and agree with pasta being disgusting when Im nearby then they re a bad person. obviously what I perceive is fact and everyone else has to follow it  if they dont then they re attacking me personally.
youre my fav youtuber now
when I seen her as the new older version of the girl  I was like... hm... they went from an fairly attractive full of energy and cute girl to wtf happend to you women.. Imean I am  sorry  but why  from the first moment I  have seen her   e felt a slight unpleasant and off-putting feeling  didnt know why... now thatshe made this remark  I googled her..the result of that was   me not liking her face way of looking at people  her facial expressions in the show.. started to make sense... and based just on the images on google  I have to ask... who had the bright ides to cast her
preach baby girl.
I feel like Ive been saying the same thing. like how can someone be a they them. unless you have multiple personality disorder  youre not a plural. and same Im like how do they come up with these. how are we supposed to keep up. and yeah I see your point on those topics. and it does seem like a trend. yes exactly  a place of concern 100 . and go boom you have. I support you. another great video melonie. never stop being you.
God bless you melonie!  if they hate you  they hated me first.  -Jesus
be strong. we are told we will be persecuted for our faith. just continue to share the truth and he will take care of you.
you look good without makeup
a writer of the 1800 s said    tolerance will reach such a level that intelligent people will be banned from thinking so as not to offend the imbeciles.
agree 100
I get the feeling that children become increasingly more confused with all this gendercrap they re bombarded with almost 24 7. because of this  I used to believe I had to be genderfluid or nonbinary or trans because I didn t like girls clothes and thought that guys have itso much easier without menstrual cramps and no boobs that are in the way. it had me really confused...until I visited my first rennaiscance fair and realised that it was just modern womens fashion I had a problem with. formfitting  elastic fabrics just weren t my thing. I loved natural fabrics and historical cuts. thats when and where I found my femininity back. so yeah  if you have a child who struggles with their gender  dont jump to conclusions right away. give them the freedom  love and support to experiment with their looks  their identity without life altering changes first. keep in contact with your children. be there for them.
I love how they eat their own metaphorically . as soon as catelyn jenner didn t agree with everything they believed in  she was considered a fraud.
Im so glad that you are a feminine woman. the world needs more like you!
damn you look so different without makeup. its nice
this is why I laugh at the whole  gen z  thing. its more accurate to call them   gen  naked emperor .
can confirm  I agree with your opinion.
melonie its real women like you who restore my faith in humanity. thank you sweetheart.
thanks melonie for being so based more women need to be like you no lie. step up speak there minds and be logical. not like these npc bot women. also think of conspiracy s as a spoiler for movies or books but in real life am I right. this clown show is getting out of hand.
wow  woman says she s good at playing women. such talent.
pure acting talent... xd
my pronouns are always my name. greg gregory gregorio
the they them is the closest one to something I could understand  but still it is insane. but the latest one I saw was someone identifies as paint. I think it was paint but still that chick needs to get help and maybe should be sterilized cause we dont need any more of that kind of crazy
I have genuine ftm trans friend with did diagnosed first. this person worked hard to get out of very abusive cesspit and yeah  lost any connection to body except self-harm. this person is a grown up female with very masculine traits and non-bs attitude  aware of own issues and being fucked for life  we can laugh about how annoying periods and hormonal fluctuations and putting weight is. I call my trans friend a him  but would never glorify what is a symptom of deep psychological issues or trauma. I had gender dysphoria myself and later got suspiciously high screening results for asperger s asd with high intellect that let me pass as almost normal and have good academic performance. I dont feel good and connected with my body in general  but this is how the life is. cant imagine bullying people into pronouncing me as a whatever gay princess dragon while having a d cup in binders and stocky female body. I also worked this out through roleplaying instead of atwater and tiktok  when I was younger
isn t they them a gender neutral pronoun  sorry if Im wrong. Im not a native english speaker but in my language   lots of other languages in asia  we dont have gender specific pronouns.
they can be used as a singular pronoun
agreeing with the other 2 comments they them can be used as singular. although  neopronouns are weird
did you have such a hard time just doing whatever you wanted to do
even back in the 80 s I had dolls as well as trucks and dinosaurs etc. all were mine its not like I had brothers .  my parents let me wear whatever and be whatever.  rarely did I ever hear  thats for boys  etc.  my parents were not particularly  progressive .  idk where people are getting these absolutely evil standards and categories they feel they have to fit in if my normie Christian parents accepted me idk where this stuff is coming from.
word
I agree!
real women  okay what if im infertile  am I not a  real woman  because I cant have kids  what if Imiscarry  am I not a  real woman  because I couldnt carry a child to term  what if im intersex and I have internal testicles but decide to outwardly present myself as female  am I not a  real woman  because I have internal testicles  what if I have pcos and high levels of testosterone and body hair  am I not a real woman because I create more testosterone naturally  God made everyone unique and that goes for people of every walk of life. you know nothing of anyone elses life but your own  so what gives you or anyone else the right to denounce a human being simply for not identifying how you want them too. embarrassing
@junebug  okay but most of these issues you raise are pretty specific. you might be able to find some  statistics  thatsay they aren t rare but I could just as easily find some  statistics  thatsay they are. the reality is what you see when you look around you. yes there are some cases like intersex people where tough choices are made. but 99  of the time  estrogen or testosterone quickly presents itself more dominantly and answers those questions for us. is it really not concerning to you that children are being mutilated before the age of consent  thats my biggest qualm with it. I think legal adults should do whatever they want absolutely  no question. but how do you not see an issue with the children.
I disagree with some stuff you said  but I really liked how respectfully you shared your opinions  if we all could just voice our thoughts with respect  the world would me much better...
keep your convictions and speak your mind and whatever you do please know for every 1 hater you trigger 20 more of us got you. God bless sweetheart
as a being whom identifies as double inverted non-binary  I understand the perspective of the actor  and also the opinion of yourselfem   and at the same time I dont. I also understand the opinion of one of you  and not the other. and the other way around.
we re constantly called bigots for having opinions and common sense. there is a line and they crossed it a long time ago! enough is enough!
mel being a little troll in her car  very valid though
the thumbnail had me rolling.
when future generations dig up the bones.   there will be male bones and female bones.    love your work young lady.
I commend you.
I think there s a mental condition too. my aunt is act like a man  dress like a man. Ive heard that happened bc her father want a son and treat her a a son. and she finally find her self more like man. but she have no problem with people called her a women. that make me agree with your statement  let the kid being kid  and she decided later who to be
I agree. I always made the argument about transgenders who are born male  went through puberty as a male  trained in a sport as a male  and then transitioned to a female at some point. when they join the olympics and compete against biological females they annihilate them  and worst they annihilate all of the records that females have worked and trained to achieved. some records could be 40 years old and they beat the record by such a huge margin that it makes it impossible for females to ever come close to beating it again. Im not saying transgender should not join the olympics  Im saying that we need to be careful before we set a precedence that can damage our history and our future. to make it worse there was a man who ran a morning talk show and he was arguing this very same opinion and the trans community and activist called him a bigot and they started petition to have him fired for this argument. and the worst part is he got fired  and that in itself is a very dangerous precedence. silencing people for having a valid opinion is fascism.
I do tomboy things but I was made tough. I am a woman and God made me strong. Im glad that men are still attracted. I used to think that I was gay because my body is strong. I come from a generation that kids hated me for being good at sports. girls weren t supposed to be good at dirt bikes. Im 59. I still ride and also snow board. anyhow  I will only be with man. its also my belief
off topic but damn you are gorgeous without makeup
dont worry melonie  they re the crazy ones.
I feel like im taking crazy pills
emma d arcy has lost it. she s gone  real gone
probably the best vid Ive seen in a long time.
feels like youre getting annoyed over essentially nothing and keeping that momentum going for 25 minutesedit  how do you go on this rant about children s education based on a headline about a dragon show
youre great thank you
bro there is just so much misinformation in this video its insane. I watched the whole video and she couldn t even stay on the topic  she just continued to spew out her reasonings for disliking trans people. she s making itseem like trans people have become an epidemic! it really breaks my heart seeing what she s become. I used to really look up to her. so sad.
people look back at our time in disbelief at our stupidity.
the problem is... there is only one of anyone  sounds like you should see a therapist...the one of her you understand is the only one of her there is..

there is nothing wrong with denying the  gender  of these weirdos. they need to be put in their place when they threaten normal people with their nonsense.
your effort at not cursing is impressive
at this point if they are going after you  you are probably on the right side of history
just let them live their life and enjoy the show.
so  you can have life altering surgeries as a kid  but cant have a drink until 21 or vote until 18  um....sure  that makes perfect sense.
where s the button for this video! really like you melonie
Ive got three daughters. I kid you not one plays football  one plays rugby and one does judo. all under the age of thirteen. they are the girliest of girls tho.
clicked on the video thinking it was gonna be some house of dragons episode review or something  pleasantly surprised at the discussion it ended up being
the intersex person you were talking about has  pseudo male hermaphroditism   its where someone develops male in the uterus  but becomes  immune   for lack of a better word  to testosterone. so they develop female anatomy  but have un-descended testes.
Im good at playing a woman   said the woman
youreally look like vanellope in this video. I d kill to see a short clip with an audio overlay.
she s really close to having a revelation but Im not sure she s going to realise it.
they tell you black is white then call you a bigot for arguing the truth.
damn melonie I wish so bad I could show why adam gave the forbiden fruit to eve.
I agree everyone wants to be honest but are just too afraid to say anything. I refuse to go along with the they them nonsense. I also met a woman that dressed exactly 100 percent female was obsessed with the color pink and more girly than most women and she tried to force me to call her him...it was ridiculous. its because all of this is becoming trendy because people want to feel more special than they are. she wasn t even trying to be masculine whatsoever. I believe that is another reason there are so many made up genders now days. if someone isn t gay  bI  or trans but wants to get special treatment they will either make up some nonsensical gender identity or just go by they them.
funny enough I actually think emma d arcy is very pretty with long hair.
the fact youre not ashamed to be a follower of Jesus Christ  made me a subscriber.  God said all these things would happen   at the en God will be victorious regardless of what people think.
clap clap clap well said
that no eyeliner look goes pretty hard ngl  feel free to compliment her.
I always found the whole pronoun thing confusing when youre talking to someone you say you   like you should go see that band they re really good.  they and them are like a third party reference. I guess if you were talking to a transgender person about another transgender person then you would use those pronouns.but in direct conversation nobody uses they or them. yet over and over again people say it makes them feel included when somebody says they and them. but they re always talking about somebody else. still I dont see what the big deal is they can have any pronoun they want. I dont care  which is I guess a sin nowadays .
bingo.
hear hear!
yes!!!
threaten normal people with their nonsense.wat
@nicole t  you live udner a rock or deny reality
@nicole t  these people act like their fantasies should be accepted as reality in day-to-day life. that is the nonsense  and it threatens society.
I used to not care  but Im actively against all this pronoun nonsense now
crazy thing is they dont accept themselves for what they are but want others to accept them
@nicole t  imagined this weirdos are more concern about sexual reproductive like a creep rather than focus more on talent in acting or make the story more entertaining. hollyweird.
@geek  poor ellen page  she was cute
offending lunatics is our duty.
@mathieu s.  elliot page is a different story  from the non-binary crap being talked about on this video.
same thing with these weirdos who believe in men in the sky who love them.
you cant defend logic and common sense without offending lunatics and crazy people.
@mike blaze  they are accepting themselves for who they are
so youre saying they never need to be put in their place
@ethan dalton  if they did accept themselves they shouldnt give a shit what other people think. they dont that why they need other people to
@mike blaze  I think its more of a case of wanting others to have basic human decency and respect
@ethan dalton  not everyone is gonna have basic human decency and respect.
@mike blaze  unfortunately.
@ethan dalton  exactly why they should just accept themselves and accept the fact some people will never agree with them
who are they threatning
they sound amazing  I love it
ooh ok  thats interesting. thank you for sharing that info!
impin ain t eazy.
still waiting on the g fuel tower. I know you can do it.
100  correct
I appreciate that you are shouting out to draw the line. I too really accept trans rights. any adult should have the right to change how they identity if they want to. considering plastic surgery has existed for years  allowing adults to go further and live their best lives as who they want to be is always a positive. and Im glad you think so too.but Im glad you are talking about the negatives of this new age. its all so fetishized now. people do it for attention and for the chance to exploit their new found  rights  to take advantage of people and its gross. so many people say that trying to control the culture is not okay and against freedom  but our modern society needs that kind of control. people are crazy and dangerous. if someone goes through the steps and identifies as the opposite sex  and actually really does it for their own health  thats fine  and their should be some sort of identifier card that is provided to them after multiple doctor appointments and such. like a fully verified thingparents allowing their kids to change their gender identity and have surgery when those children are no where near the age to fully comprehend the weight of that decision is pretty despicableI get that having the government have some sort of control over your identity sucks and makes some people not feel free  but not having thatsort of documentation and control over who really is and isn t trans allows dangerous people to get away with awful things. and then its all covered up cause no one wants to tall about it cause it damages the cause. no  not outing these people damages the cause  it makes all trans people look bad for not standing up and showing they are not a part of these sickos trying to exploit the systemat least some prisons have been trying to initiate new separate wards for trans men and women separate from eachother and the cis gendered inmates. but more definitely needs to be done. and people need to stop using transitioning as a form of social fulfillment
concern for common sense    -- yep  that
not everyone has to fit into a category melonie. I believe you are a naturally very tolerant person. so Im surprised that you are not very tolerant towards emma d arcy.
please  please  please. do not fall into their trap of having to explain yourself.its they who should first ask for your reasons as to your opinion and only then  canthey decide on what that implies  based upon your reasoning.the fact they just skip straight to calling anyone who disagrees with them an ist  ism or ot means the problem is with them  not you or us.
a non-achievement is an achievement for people who wanna feel self-important when they really aren t that much. if water carrying marathons were an event she d be champion.
aww youre doing brave cuuuute
melonie is proof the world needs more tomboys.
melonie  bravo!
I really wanted to give this a chance but once you said  I used to play with boy things. im still a woman!!  it made things very obvious.you have 0 interest in meeting in the middle with trans nonbinary people. you have 0 interest in unlearning damaging stereotypes or starting that journey either. theres a huge difference between  being a tomboy  and being a child who is trans and growing up like that. and you have no interest in understanding it because you already made up your mind thatsomeone might be different and that disgusts you to the point where you are saying that they re gasligting you.... because they re saying  I exist . but whatever. as long as God and the boys pick you I guess all is well. have the day you deserve.
this is what happens when anyone can just go to a grocery store to get food. now we have all this free time to just make shit up.
its ironic that an acceptance movement  people want to define everyone in tightly defined boxes about what they should like if they identify as something  i.e to be a girl  you have to like dolls.
its crazy how much hypocrisy there is. they talk about women s rights and stuff  but yet they wont let you speak your mind
most if not all cases Ive seen with the attack helicopter are people mocking the pronoun nutters. either way nice to see you saying it how it is. too many wont these days.
I wanna be a dragon!
no child is born in the wrong body. protect children.
12 40the correct term here is  complete androgen insensitivity syndrome  or cais.  it is a fairly rare condition.  to call someone with cais  intersex  is a bit of a misnomer.  in reality  the best way to describe these types are as  baren women .  in the past  before the advent of chromosome analysis these people for all intents and purposes were just classed as women  with the exception that no matter what  they could not have children.
I just use any preemptive accusations or idiotic virtue signaling as a good indication I should save my money and time for something better  its actually kinda helpful
its like all these folks are so bored with their relatively bland  normal lives  they need to create some kind of complication or struggle to give themselves some purpose  drama or entertainment.
from all the interviews Ive seen of emma she seems like a nice person
@tim o  they seem
clearly they are
@ethan dalton  no they aren t.
grandma found the youtubes
got to call it out this time  really good intro and really good take on the subject melonie! I totally agree. hating on each other rarely solves anything anyway. real talk and getting back to a common ground is the real goal anyone should aim for. whether we are talking social  cultural or political issues of our present. naturally that means taking and especially listening to each other and not screaming radical bs into each others ears  just for the sake of getting a differentiating point across... as far as the  transgenderish  pronoun community and the  I identify as xyz  fraction is concerned... umh  ill try to phrase it as authentic as I can. I think we all remember some examples relating towards this  if you are in school  and identify yourself as  a cat  towards your teacher and classmates  and you areactually serious about it  dont be upset when the teacher throws you out  as they should ! because cats have no business being in school! they do not and cannot learn algebra or political sciences. they cant! so go home  live your life as a neet and play a round of stray... or even better  get some help.  even tolerance has limits  where at some point it just ends up as mere disingenuous compassion for the sake of avoiding conflict.just a little note. I wrote this half way through her video. imagine my surprise  melonie later catching up on the same example.
your eyes looks so bright and beautiful in this video! 100  agree with the points in this thought  its this rubbish im like......I dont want to watch the show because of the shiet that comes out of these peoples mouths..hands...twitter...stuff
alright new video yay
as a lazy person  I can relate to people who identify as non-binary. no wig  no hormone therapy  no surgery required  no effort other than to remember to tell people your pronoun.
we ve reached a point where we cant just  live and let be  anymore. honestly the madness needs to be called out and not tolerated  because these are people who are denying reality to live obsessed fantasies. its one thing to maybe play a game and pick an avatar not like you. thats just escapist fun. but these people are demanding everyone forego truth and reality and adhere to the mental illness in their heads.
Im a woman  playing a woman  disguised as another woman
when nothing is sacred there is nothing to lose when nothing is sacred all is consumed  dont be surprised if when foundations are removed it all comes down
thank you!
humans are an organism and all organisms have variations. that one or another human would have an internal experience out of sync with their gender is not only possible  it is inevitable. emma can absolutely have an internal experience completely out of sync with being a woman. perhaps they are sexually attracted to women  perhaps they are relatively low empathy  prone to physical confrontation  more naturally inclined to critical thinking rather than interpersonal - etc etc etc all of which made them fundamentally not identify with other women for the whole of their life. saying  of course she can play a woman she is one!  fails to take people are very likely honestly telling you about their internal experience at their word. y all act like you are standing up against some sort of absurdity or attack on rational thought  but itseems like you are the ones not thinking rationally. I am a man but playing certain types of men would extremely difficult because I dont identify with them - my internal experience is just completely alien to theirs. are you going to tell me that this is absurd or gaslighting because I have man parts  nonsense.
why couldn t they just have aged milly alcock  I already didn t like the cast change. now Im gonna think of this every time I see her.
the t community has truly crossed the line with this pronoun stuff. this community is openly trying to replace women and they also target a certian age group. its time to push back against this.
amen melonie!!
was 3 45am after watching your video on this the evening before when I woke up and itsuddenly occurred to me what the actor had meant by her comment  it was that ridiculous it took me that long  lol. I often wake up with revelations like that.
I go by he him and I love peeing while standing. Im really good at it.
she looks prettier without all that eyeliner and makeup
the sad thing about thatstatement is that itshould be ironic sarcastic but its said as a desperate attempt to get compliments. are these young people really s  insecure that they constantly feel the need to be praised  or do they feel entitled to constant praise  which is even worse
let them freak and respond. the more people speak about it the less power they have to silence. its gotten out of hand and children are now being harmed whilst the perpetrators are being protected in the community. talk about it  speak against it  let them become afraid that there is pushback against it. it only shows that more people are waking up to it no longer being about equality and right to live as they wish  and its more  my way or the highway  mindset  the hypocrisy in the movement has become astounding.
Im really good at acting as a dude. especially still because I can pee standing up
very reasonable views  nothing even remotely controversial in most reasonable people s opinions. carry on.
oh  no!  fonzie is water skiing right toward thatshark!
youre so right. I consider myself pretty libertarian and like to mind my own business  but sadly the woke crowd cant do that. they re ruining livelihoods because we as a society have been quiet and let stuff go. after how tyrannical they have been  I feel compelled to speak out
natural beauty
@m green  yea after a couple of times...its like  next
if you were around back when she was a genuine gaming youtube channel. the fanbase had a panic the first time they saw her without makeup. it was like she lied to everyone. seeing positive comments now shows how much her fanbase has grown
@kjfriend1  she posts gaming vids
@kjfriend1  more like fanbase changed  this is a talking head channel and not a gaming channel. her gaming channel has a different name
dunno about that  her face is a blur so she is still using makeup and a powerful light to de-age herself  old photographer trick
@kjfriend1   it was like she lied to everyone well she did.
I work with a couple guys who are adamantly right-wing  to the point where sometimes its a little much. they re very black white on their views. Imyself would call myself left... if we were in the 80s 90s. they brought up how disgusting it is to consider gender as a construct. my opinion on it opened as  well  it is  but...  and I got cut off with angry yelling. the point I was going to make  was that gender is a construct  based upon biological sex. we have two sexes as a species. simple as that. we re not frogs  or slugs. we have two. being intersex hermaphrodite are  glitches in the system  as it were. its bizarre to me  as I often feel like the left just kept moving farther left.
I think you see this from a perspective off judgement and not from a perspective of curiosity. how they would like to present themselves and be treated and preseved is something very personal. as a former tomboy myself I see the power of presenting oneself to accommodate and help others to more easily see what you are all about. its not some form of trickery but a way to portay a more honest version of yourself. cheers!
these types of people love nothing more than judging accusing media critics as  bigots
subscribed  for speaking ur mind
dont back down.  youre correct and we all know it.  someone needs to say the emperor has no clothes.
you are amazing
imagine making a whole video about someone s gender because you disagree with how they identify.
you need to up load to rumble. I feel this platform  is going too far with censorship.
the kid next door to my parents thinks he s a dinosaur. he roars at people and runs around like a raptor.
it reminds me of how many actresses are now suddenly coming out as bisexual despite many of them exclusively dating or being married to men. its a social fad no different than the goth or emo phase of the last 25 years except wine moms are now pathologizing teen angst for brownie point.
I started this channel to go boom!
first  I want to start this comment off by saying I am approaching this in a respectful manner and I hope that the comments I receive in return can continue to be respectful. I dont understand why its so difficult to just respect others. emma identifies as non-binary so just use their pronouns its thatsimple. if you dont understand it or get it ok  but that doesnt mean we should invalidate or disrespect that person. I think people who have a hard time understanding non-binary or trans individuals should probably speak with someone who is non-binary or trans to that they can get a better understanding and a different perspective. its not about being woke  people have been dealing with this issue since beginning of time we just have more visibility now. many cultures have recognized people with different genders or a third gender  my own tribe zunI indians recognize two-spirit individuals. the concept of gender is not new its just getting more attention and has more representation now. people are no longer living in fear or shame and actually living authentic lives. I can get into the science of it and go into details about brain patterns and dysphoria but thats a whole other conversation. I just wish instead of writing it off or ridiculing it people would take some time to try and understand it.
as far as I know  this  woke  phenomenon is just a western thing. in eastern society  people are much more conservative and respectful of traditions. in the end  I think this movement is going to end up imploding on itself. every once in a while there is some trending movement that is adopted by groups of impressionable young people who strongly desire a sense of belonging  but they almost always end up disappearing with the arrival of the next movement.
the sjw and the alphabet community movement isn t about acceptance  or using pronouns. its about idol worship. you have people who cant accept themselves so they look for acceptance and reverance from others even if its through force and when they can force or influnce your thoughts  actions  and speech then they become your God.
when I first saw this I was like...me  let it go brain...my brain  but...me  I know just let go brain  you are just going to hurt yourself.
woman with confused self-identity says she is good at playing women. people around her dont point out the stupidity of this statement for fear of hurting her fifis. regardless of how that person identifies  if she is born as and still is biologically a woman  yes Im also a biologist  go away ankle-biters  she is uniquely suited for playing a a woman character because of obvious reasons and shouldn t surprise anybody  especially herself.its like a samuel l jackson saying  Im so good at portraying black characters . no duh  maybe its because you are born with a specific ethnicity heritage genetics
100  right!
few years back I was advocating for trans rights for younger people too. now  seeing how they treat people and the horror that many transitioned people have about the decision that was made in a bad place in their life  and how it has made their life painful in many common day aspects  because it was done too young for them to understand the whole implications of the deed had to their bodily functions  and seeing how they are treated as haters and fobics now  even if it might be a problem in the surgery or something. luckily my friend didn t go through it  he she just realized that he she can do whatever feels good  without going through it  dressing pretty and clothing more womanly  because I think the he she understood the risks. we dont have a gender specific 3rd person pronoun luckily in finnish  both sexes are  h n   so it makes things easier here. I commonly make the mistake when speaking english  both ways  as its not a gendered language here.
you know your take is completely reasonable lil boom dont let the ridiculous minded have you doubting yourself
I relate to this so hard. my politics would likely be considered left in the 90 s  or maybe centrist  but now they call me alt right
@melonie mac go boom  thanks for the reply. I was concerned I didn t word my thoughts well enough.
I already have my channel synced to rumble and odysee
I think some of it is programming  brainwashing too. the whole woke movement had me questioning my own sexuality at one point even though I have only dated men and have never even kissed a woman let alone more lol! getting back into my faith over these past couple years and waking up to the current social programming and nonsense has been a game changer for mebut seeing how all that was confusing to me as a woman in her 30 s  it just further validates my opinion that children should not be taught about any of this stuff until they are old enough to understand
@melonie mac go boom  oh no! not the horror of introspection! we must protect these children from the terrible  terrible teachings of acceptance  inclusion and exploration!
@b atrice ghattas  even tho you just came here to hate  I wanna thank you for giving melonie s video the engagement and traffic  it will help more people see this video
we are definitely regressing back to male and female stereotypes with if you dont fit perfectly into a box in terms of your interests and personality  you have to fit into a different gender box.
worst thing about the pronoun crazy tiktok is that it can be  and will be  seen by children and early teens
loving the no makeup vibe  keep torching them all like the dragons on the show does to others
why is women like this host not available anymore
Im a public school teacher. its rampant and out of control  and yes  the  identifies as a cat  is real  last year there was a huge issue with a kid demanding a litter box in the bathroom. I think there are legitimate cases of dysphoria among young people  but those kids largely keep it personal and quietly go about their business. the kids who make a show of it are doing exactly that  playing a part and performing  whilst demanding absurdities of the rest of us.re  that dragon girl  I wonder if she realizes thatshrek is a fictional work set in a fantasy world completely removed from reality for the purposes of entertainment. keep it up melonie! great work  and all the best to you
thank you for calling out this marxist insanity for what it is.
shes good at it because no doubt a lot of people treated her like a woman at face value.
live and let live.
is that a steelers hat on little melonie Im glad you found your feminine side the world needs more lady steeler fans.
people can identify as whatever  you do you but dont expect me to play along.
major karen.
neo-pronouns should be the first question asked in these sorts of discussion  anyone claiming that everyone should be respectful will have to either support them    make themselves look silly  or they ll have to disavow them  which gets them to agree to at least some limits.
I agree with you that the they them stuff should be reserved for people who are intersex instead of it being used for male or females who dont want to identify as a gender which is not only insulting to intersex people but more insulting to God cuz youre basically saying you hate his creation and how he made you which definitely makes him sad.
how did this happen ..Im being sincere...how did these clearly insane individuals  many who claim to be powerless and oppressed  become so powerful and oppressive
youre making perfect sense to me  here. while I  like you  as a fellow Christian  try to be understanding and respectful of people who are legitimately gender dysphoric  I concur that you have to draw the line somewhere  and that line not being drawn was what led to a 14-year-old boy graping two girls in west va not too long ago because the boy insisted on wearing a skirt and using female pronouns  and using the girl s bathroom because of that line not being drawn more clearly. the whole  57 genders and who knows how many pronouns  thing is simply fiction! in general  to me  its the new generation of  activists  who are a substantially small yet vocal subset of the lgbt community who are making the rest of all the lgbt people in america look as crazy as they are. I do agree that there s also entirely too many people out there jumping on the bandwagon of being  trans   gender fluid  etc.  and trying to get attention  affirmation  and the associated  privilege  that comes with thatstatus. besides  as a guy who has never been the traditional macho alpha male stereotype that Im supposed to be  Im artsy  more sensitive and intellectual than the average guy and you know what  Im as straight as an arrow and know in my heart of hearts that I am a man. just because Im artsy and sensitive doesnt mean Im any kind of lgbt or anything like. I call myself the  walking gray area   because thats what I am  and I dont need no fancy schmancy new school fictional pronouns to denote that fact.
great video.
if ignorance was a person
I think the best thing to do is not care about them. they can shout to everybody they are dragons or furries  most people in the real world will find itsilly. barely anyone will use understand these pronouns anyway. if they make drama when people dont aknowledge them  just let them cry.
in 2018 I published a paper on the ethical impermissibility of cross-sex hormone therapy in minors. fortunately I teach somewhere that understands what truth is. its crazy out there!
sometimes I feel like superman that doesnt mean I can punch through walls and beat up 100 people at once and fly to the moon and stuff
I think we should progress to a point where stereotypes dont matter  and aren t a bad thing  not everyone follows a stereotype  but they are real.
define marxism
she s lived life as a woman too  she s gone through puberty as a girl into a woman.
itsure is  and thank you!
she is an amazing incredible actress.
that tiktok cracked me up
screw the backlash. people who buy into this crap are insane. never enable mental health. people who believe they are something other than xx xy need serious counseling help.
the real issue isnt being fought in this world. its in the spirit world ... that is the world of people who have already died. they influence the physical world continuously  and people who are still alive. theres a lot of people being influenced by those who have already died  spirits  into believing they are not the gender they were assigned. when they finally  transition  they are often apeasing those spirits that are with them  constantly pressing on them to identify as the opposite gender  or neither gender. the lack of awareness of the spirit world  life after death is what is making it hard to address this movement. people are mistaking the feelings projected at them from the spirits around them... as their own.
the trouble is that  today  if - to borrow the image of the famous fable - the child in the crowd were to say aloud  but the emperor is naked!   the emperor would have nothing to worry about. he would not even have to have the child arrested or beaten by his guards. the crowd itself would take care of it.
only 4 min in and subbed!!
blair white is great! she does not claim she is the same as a biological woman.
I wish people knew the definition of the word  phobia . its like...if you dont like someone then its called phobia  never mind the fact thatsomeone isnt scared of what thatsomeone doesnt like lmao!! phobia is fear....not dislike!!
Im confused as to why you jumped from emma saying they enjoy playing a woman and is good at it to ranting about children transitioning and other trans related political issues.  emma feels both female and male  big deal.  what does that have to do with kids transitioning  let emma live their life and speak about the role of rhaenyra  without having to turn it in some huge political issue.  you are soap boxing about politics based on one little sentence that emma said.  are you suggesting emma shouldn t speak about their experience because they are nonbionary and  it might possibly inspire a younger person to consider their own gender  you want your free speech  but it feels like you want to shut down emma s.
government  guys we dont have that much space and food we cant support more people.government lackey  why dont we make itso that everyone wants to be trans and become sterile.government  tommy you are a God damn geniusfuture  human life drops by 50
Ive got to respect you sticking to your guns  Ive lost friends over this ridiculousness. its not easy  honestly Im surprised the feminists aren t up in arms oversome of these issues.
apparently  that canadian shop teacher waa trolling the school board. they tried to fire him for toxic masculinity. troll level jedImaster.
this is what happens when people have too much free time on their hands. why dont you see any of this insanity in eastern european countires   speaking from experience  I come from one of those countries . its because people here are more concerned with real world problems  we dont need to make up new ones. tbh everything thats going on with the western countries scares me. I hope you guys figure it out so we dont get to experience the same things with our future generations. at the moment  we re too busy worrying about our neighbouring countries deciding to march in on us for lols xd melonie  I really appreciate the fact that youre not scared to speak up! I know how hard it can be to speak sense into this world  the cancel mob might be on your heels again. but this is what a strong empowered woman looks like. she s not afraid to speak her mind. you go girl!also  you look gorgeous in this video! did you change your make up  your eyes look so big and pretty!!!
when I was like 4 I played with barbie s and thought it wasn t fair that boys didn t wear dresses and makeup . because I had two older sisters. didn t make me a girl. but today some people would have pressured my parents to treat me as a girl.
for me its simple-1. as long as your anatomy says you are a female male  you are a female male. maybe its my training in the medical field  but you cant fool me.2. respect straight people s rights just as much as you want your rights to be respected. 3. I cant sacrifice my grammar for your pleasure maybe I ll just use your name all the time.
here is the biggest problem with woke culture in general  but the current trans activism.  according to them  we cant hurt their feelings  have to cater to each of them  everyone else must  according to them.  but  what about my feelings  my beliefs  my well-being when being forced to do and say what they preach
Im so offended  just realized that as a man people never compliment me on how convincing I am as a man. Im about to set the world on fire  who s with me!   american wokeism reminds me of the movie idiocracy. after having trump the white house its better than ever. watch it.
I know now for a fucking fact that we  as a species  are fading away like piss on the wind... I rooting for aenema right now!
frankly you shouldn t have dignified this backlash with a response.
its not just you.
I see what you did there
@pdl me  wasn t my intention  the acting is performed to an incredible level. is that better
imagine being this antI science
literally  from all the interviews Ive seen emma seems like a nice person. I guess this chick needs to fake outrage to get money
@tim o  right   this vid just feels like she is click baiting a high profile individual and show in order to pander to the far right for views.  what s sad is how many people are just eating it up. like  c mon isn t this pretty obvious  emma s sentence was pretty straight forward and not a big deal.
because why did  feeling like a man  or  feeling like a woman  ever need to become a thing in the first place  it reinforces the idea there there is a psychological difference between men and women  its reinforcing a set of stereotypes. all we had to say was being a male or female doesnt matter that much for who we are and just move on. people insisting that 99  of people change the way they speak  it just seems unnecessary. I think this is where the divide comes from  the decision of lgbtq that gender is stereotype. average joes out there never got behind this and I feel they never will. its a giant misunderstanding. just because those stereotypes exist doesnt mean that man and women didn t really just mean male and female to most people up until like 5 years ago. I believe there is still room for trans people in this paradigm  they want to identify as one or the other  and they can  they transition  the vast majority of people will identify them as they wish.I saw les miserables with a female friend one night but I wasn t dating her. does that mean I  felt like a woman  that night  or does it just mean that I did a thing that any human could do  but that a lot of society would see as a  girly  thing.in fact  what made me able to break social norms and do that was because my friendship with her transcends man  woman. emphasizing that men and women are  a feeling  would have made my friendship with her uncomfortable.
straight people s right  lmaoo as if yall need to fight for yours
@sonia khansa  we do!
@john thehumanist  no we dont
this video was not made to address backlash  but to speak out in solidarity to those who have been too afraid to say something
@melonie mac go boom  fair point
the best defense against their gaslighting is to ask one simple question   what s wrong with being transphobic
haha man... I generally think of myself as a centrist  but the silly identity politics of the far left are driving me further right I remember when the left was about environmentalism and workers rights.. smh
the trans kid thing is entirely indefensible  you are being way too nice about this. you absolutely do not have to tolerate things that you know are wrong. scientifically  morally  however you look at it its wrong. if you  tolerate  it one day you ll wake up and you ll be surrounded by it with nowhere to escape. your kids will be telling you they are trans and want to chop their parts off because its trendy or something. tolerance is not a virtue it is an evil. you are what you tolerate.
how was I not subscribed to you
are children being mutilated  well besides circumcision  as well as I think youre talking about two things. sex and gender are two different things. I believe emma darcy is talking about her identifying as non binary.
I think you are spot on. state your opinion - its yours - move on.  if they dont like it - oh well - dont watch.
some people have valid concerns about people who get tattoos. why dont you do a video about that  Im just a regular girl. thats all. however  I dont feel the need to go after people who are clearly having their own issues. other people having rights doesnt mean my rights are being revoked.  leave this discussion to the professionals  and the people involved. its none of our business. they have enough problems without some youtuber throwing in their two cents.  leave them alone.
to me the most serious fallacy is that what happens on screen  or is presented in narrative or characters  as fiction  has any impact on the real world  of rights  duties  freedoms  obligations. it doesnt. this is a weak and wrong understanding of sociolinguistics  semiotics  reception theory  and sociology. we went through this in the 1980s and 90s with the supposed malign impact of heavy metal  punk  comix  gaming  whatever  and there have been later moral panics in asia about gaming. there is no sufficient or significant impact even on the most intense consumer of a particular art form or cultural product. violent games dont make gamers violent. the opposite is also true - its a fallacy that putting all media through the d I purity test will make a real difference  in the real world  amongst viewers  gamers etc. its fiction  upon delusion  upon fantasy. leave representation to where it really matters - the house of representatives  voting  electoral engagement  and accountability.  ever wonder to whom  diverse and inclusive  or representatives on screen or in the media companies are actually accountable to  pretty much only themselves. thats not representation  its self interest.
fellow straight  tomboy  and common sense Christian here. idk  I feel like  isn t it a step in the right direction that  instead of teens feeling like they need surgery to alter their bodies to be  accepted  in society  they see that its an option to express and experiment with their gender outwardly however they want without getting permanent surgery when they re too young to make such a choice  the pendulum of culture has to swing back and forth  and this is part of that. if this concept for teenagers of  I can experiment with my gender however it falls on the spectrum of masculine-feminine without surgery  gets rejected and treated with hostility  then doesnt it just tell teens who may be confused thatsurgery is their best shot at being  accepted   I have a close nonbinary friend with bipolar disorder who legitimately suffered with their gender identity for decades before this concept came into public consciousness  and for the first time that Ive known them  they aren t suicidal every single day. its nothing at all like how I felt growing up as a ballet-dancing tomboy  where I was just frustrated with all the double standards between myself and my brothers  and frustrated that people thought there were  boy  things and  girl  things  like video games were a  masculine  thing in those days and dance was  only for girls  lmao so stupid . I believe my friend s confusion and suffering is very much a real thing thats very different from what my experience was  and I think comments on here trying to compare the expression of masculinity and femininity to people claiming to be a whole other species are way off the mark. we all have both masculine and feminine  yin and yang in us  so I think its wrong for people to claim thatsaying  Im both masculine and feminine  is the same mental state as  Im actually a tiger and biologically need to eat nothing but raw meat.  Imean  cmon lol. where s people s compassion
Im good at playing women too. I usually pick nina williams and claire redfield.
melonie  you are a dream  smart   entertaining w no bs. with you all the way on pumping the brakes on gender surgery for children. non binary w pronouns is a fantasy. do your thing  but dont expect others to buy in. hate never helps
rip and tear and booom until it is done!!!
I am trans. I have gender and body dysphoria. I enjoy stuff that is stereotypical to the gender I was born with.now that the cards have been laid out  I honestly feel trans should be viewed in two parts  if gender affects their environment then itshould be taken into consideration.sports should be judged based on the born gender. jail should be based upon transition stage and even at that is still a bit grey so I d still say mostly back to born gender.children could be told if asked but no actions taken till they are older.
you are definitely not a terf
I dont understand this pronoun thing. dont you use a person s pronouns when talking to a third person  for example  if bill is talking to sue about mary  how would mary know that bill used the wrong pronouns unless sue reports back to mary  I just dont get it.
first time   me who has stated this opinion for the past 13 years before it was cool in my noose lol
not to mention  blaire white isn t a transwoman lesbian  a south park mr garrison joke from 2005-2007   blaire is into dudes. which as the woman s bathroom goes  I know for a fact most women are cool with that. the transwoman lesbian into girls  this is where that Im in danger uncomfortablity.
with common sense on your side .. the mic drop is getting old .. lol .. power to ya young lady  respects and peace to you ms melonie.. stay you woman .. opps forgot that pro-noun you wasn t asking for.. damn it lol
im just so past it at this point. screw the entire lot of them... like 98  of them are creeps and or groomers.
you gotta narrow down your points melonie  because I actually surprisingly agreed with some of your points  shared bathrooms and stuff  but when you adressed the title which is emma d arcy I think I lost u there. like we can call both intersex and trans with they them pronouns if this will make them feel any better  and it doesnt matter if you...maybe...dont believe in trans ppl s experiences  dont know about that just assuming  you can just agree with me that its okay to know that people are different especially if you didn t experience that issue at hand.
I would say instead that acknowledging the objective reality and biological facts isn t transphobic. on a side note  its quite ironic considering that these are same people who say   trust the science   yet they are denying reality when it comes to biology
post-script I am a libertarian and I am 100  opposed to any and all violence and force  especially by proxy of government  against peaceful lgbt individuals...however  I have zero obligation to respect your  made-up  pronouns or validate your feelings or your scientifically-inaccurate delusions.
phobia means irrational fear of so I would never say that bc I dont fear trans ppl. Im just not gonna pretend for their feelings sake.
@p. h. illip    libertarian leftie here. your post script pretty much sums up my position as well. people really need to free themselves from dependence on external validation. just be your best self. most people will react to that positively.
sounds like a useless question. what I ask is  can you define what transphobia means   you d be surprised how many trans-zealots wont answer. because words like transphobia  homophobia  racist  etc  they know what the words mean and they know its ugly when you attribute it to someone. they re not interested in correctly identifying the actual transphobes  they re just trying to label anyone s opinion on the topic they dont like by an ugly word to point fingers at who the media will discredit or who the left will put on their enemy list.
also  from what I understand  the concept of a  2-spirit  or nonbinary 3rd gender has existed for thousands of years in a number of cultures. our culture simply hasn t had the language for it until now. I dont understand why people care tbh. language changes all the time and humans learn new concepts all the time as well as new scientific facts about our biology and neurology. I dont get why people get their panties in a bunch over something like the singular use of  they.  at least its simplified and not all the random pronouns that were popping up in 2012 that no one could ever remember. so yea  I dont get the bunched-up panties over this at all! I really want to understand....why do people care about pronouns  like if a woman gets married  her last name changes  and we all start calling her by that name. might take some getting used to  but we do it. but a different pronoun  clutch the pearls! I dont get it
thank you for sharing your perspective
they re not though  are they
my biggest fear with this is that people may use this whole thing to cover up other psychological issues. they get validation and praise for existing while other underlying issues get to run rampant  exacerbated by hormone imbalances from hrt. its no wonder that the suicide rate in the trans community is horrifically high and there are people trying to teach children that this is the way to be.Ive got absolutely no problems with the existence of trans people. in fact almost all of the ones that Ive met are excellent individuals for whom I would gladly give up a limb. but there are inherent pitfalls to transition and society just loves pretending that they dont exist  thus ensuring that they continue to do so. thatshit ain t right.
Ive been tired of all that nonsense since the beginning. its all nonsense and does nothing for anyone  but itsure can get us railed up.
I feel like we need the mongols again...
great video!!!!!
who are you to say someone else cant express themselves the way they feel is right.
Im sure you ve heard it a million times before  but  damn! you are extremely beautiful!  regarding the video  I am an atheist and I totally agree with you  I have a 2-year-old daughter  and Im very scared of the world she ll have to grow up in  Ive always been against this anti-biology community  I am a man of science  I am amazed by humans genetic s and it really triggers me when they talk about  being born in the wrong body  and what concerns me  even more  is pedophilia  it is already starting to gain a lot of track  they are victimizing the pedo people  as long as they dont act against children  they are not bad  I feel the age of consent is gonna grow lower and lower in the following years  I feel we might get to a point were having sex with children will be something  normal  kind of like islam  where old guys marry girls down to 12 years old  and you are right  we must speak up  because if we dont  no one will.
being proud of the gonads I was born with  it looks like a print on a t-shirt or banner on straight pride day  or being attracted to gonads opposite to mine  offends a lot of people these days. but this is not the opposite of acceptance and inclusion  lol- my gonads dont define me!says the person who defines himself as  not having a defined gender  but who requires them to use the pronoun -  dragongumbluelightsaber - yes  your gonads define you  the imaginary ones!
is she a biologist too
I recently found out that in old english  man was used to define a person. a male was a wereman and a female was a wifman.why dont we go back to calling ourselves wereman and wifman and anyone who is gender neutral can be a man
best thing I ever did was subscribing to this channel
its not thatserious bro
agreed! dna  the blueprint for ourselves  is fundamental and ancient  even plants have dna. human brains are fairly new to the evolutionary party  and they re complicated beyond our current ability to understand  and they break in all sorts of interesting ways. dna says who you are  but some folks have brains that have gotten very  very confused. p.s. Im old and old-fashioned  so what do I know  but fwiw  liking the lighter eye makeup.
concern for common sense.  you just nailed it! Ive been trying  for years  to find a phrase that expresses my concern for society normalizing  non-binary  nonsense well enough. thatsentence perfectly does it. thanks!
if you stand for everything you stand for nothing.
18 38 people are losing they re jobs!  people are losing their lives!!! its literally illegal to be trans  or gay or anything in a lot of countries today. and youre complaining that people cant voice judgemental opinions!   this is why pride and representation is so important  for people to understand that everyone should be treated with love  not interrogate for what they identify as
I wont  tolerate  or  be nice about it . these adults are free to play out their own madness in their head and dress as they like. but they will not force me to play along with them. reality is reality. if you aren t sure which toilet facilities to use and looking in your underwear is still confusing - go see a therapist.
what was even the point of this video
a big part of the problem is that you even touch these topics. Imean  I get it  its idiotic and frustrating as fuck  to the point that its very difficult not to talk about how idiotic the wokes are  but by giving them the spotlight  you unwillingly keep on shining light on this issue. I also believe that its still mostly an americanthing to discuss these things en masse  because even if america is the land with the most non-binary people in the world and the greatest diversity  its still an overall minority and the vast majority of people remain logical and reasonable. as a non-american looking in  you americans really have a gift of making things a big deal when it really isn t that grand on the scale of the world. sure  there are lgbt people where I live but it is nowhere near as visible as it is in america and also those people aren t  pushing  themselves into the sight - so to speak - nearly as much on social media as americans do.as a result  it is far easier to acknowledge that they exist and respect them for just being what they are  for being different and wanting appropriate rights and all that. anyways  all this to say thatsocial media is a cancer of the highest proportion and that everyone would be far more sane and content with their lives the less they willingly choose to participate in this social media bullshit.
you cant give the cultists an inch. they prey on your desire to get along and to be seen as a good person. it doesnt make you a bad  unkind person if yourefuse to affirm peoples delusions. it makes you a principled person.
concern for a bigoted  intolerant society  would be more accurate
@ethan dalton  there s a huge difference between intolerance and not buying into someone s delusions.
@hozagen  congrats on doubling down on the intolerance
rent was due
@tim o  lmaaooo
as a russian I am geniuly pleasantly surprised that there re still americans like you. for the record  Imyself have problems with gender dysphoria  imagine how it feels  while living in such conservative country as russia  and even so the sort of things that were brought up in this video seems absurd to me.
she s good  at playing a girl  because she is one.
emma hasn t even done shit to any of you and your seething lmao
furthermore  just as they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God  so God gave them over to a depraved mind  so that they do what ought not to be done.  - romans 1 28. we live in the times God predicted unfortunately would happen because people replaced God with the worship of sex  instead of higher things.
I agree with pretty much all your points but I will say  religion is just as guilty when it comes to indoctrinating the young. no offense meant  thats not solely your religion  thats all religions.
incredibly sexy hair style. my all time fav.
I actually dont mind they them and will often use it when Im unsure of the person in question s gender  but the second you tell me to call you dragon dragons or something  I will disengage and walk away  because they them are out of their they re there Goddamn mind.
I identify as an old grape. my pronouns are  sultana  raisin and currant. as charlton heston once said    its a madhouse! . time to leave earth...
melonie  nothing is more radical than speaking the truth in public. great video  may our Lord watch over you.
none binary is basically gender queer. and emma d  archy is really cool and down to earth in all of their interviews and is great as rhaenyra. Im pretty they agree that children shouldn t be mutilated without their consent.
not sure why youre so triggered by them but ok  emma has explained   I have all the tools necessary to play a woman. after all I identified as one for a very very long time.  the article made their statement seem trivial and egoist and that is far removed from the truth of it. they are an actor. and non binary. what s so wrong with that  youre confused  maybe try and understand them rather than make a video whinging about how confused you are but pinning the responsibility of your emotions on them. if you claim to be an ally to lgbtqia than why are you acting like a terf  yes a terf. because nb falls under the trans label. we dont know their journey  but the least one can do is respect how they want to be referred to as. and if you are going into a moral panic then you need to assess yourself and how you project that onto others. its strange how people conflate trans or nb persons as being confused when the only person seemingly insecure about trans identities is people like you and the ones in the comments agreeing with you.   if any of y all so much as attempt to  correct  me by using  she  or  her  for emma  dont waste your time.
she s right! find it hard not to agree!
Ive never understood why trans people were lumped in with gays and lesbians. being gay means being attracted to the same sex  it is based on what you feel about another person. being trans doesnt mean you are attracted to other trans people. it is a psychological condition regarding their perception of their own body. it has nothing to do with being sexually attracted to another person. so I dont understand why it even falls into a category that is meant to label peoples sexual preference.
beautiful factress!
its quite sad how frustrated you are about other people lives that dont concern you. if people aren t hurting anyone with being themselves how bitter can you be that you have to rant for 30 minutes just because someone feels more comfortable using a different pronoun  do youreally have no better things to do in your life  and acting like youre the victim because you occasionally have to use a different pronoun about another person is beyond absurd and narcissistic. nobody is asking for you to understand it  just respect it. making a transphobic video about how youre not transphobic but continuously repeating its disease and nonsense and with it encouraging haters to discriminate people who already struggle with so much is far from okay. nobody is taking your freedom of speech youre making that quite clear  but you can choose to use it better. and while blabbing about how hard it is for you because youre expected to respect and value others with something that requires no effort  youre judging a minority that has been hated and discriminated for centuries although they never harmed anyone. all lgbt  community.  youre talking about being able to give kids choice over their bodies like its the end of the world  completely disregarding the fact that literally millions of children and adults are every day still bullied  beaten and even getting killed just because of which gender they love or relate more to. and with this kinds of videos youre encouraging that.youre literally not required to do anything against your will  even if its so hard for you to just use a different pronoun occasially you dont have to nobody is going to make you or beat you  but labeling people who are different than you weirdos and sick for half an hour just because your Bible reading narrow mind doesnt understand it  and acting like youre the mad and offended one  thats what truly absurd.
hey! can you do a video on the subtle ways in which they are still trying to get agenda through in this show  it needs to be talked about how much better the show could have been if it gave other characters for time and didn t focus on gender politics!  please and thank you
melonie is not only  pretty but based too itseems  I always thought you were more on the woke side. haven t heard from you in years tho. refreshing in todays clown world  to see yourepresenting a voice of common sense and reason.
at this point  I just click like before watching the video xd
I thought you might be Christian and am so grateful you professed faith in this video! happy to see my sister-in-Christ being bold in the faith!
giiiirl....yes! yes yes
nobody has ever asked you that.
you can be a tomboy and never want to go through a medical transition. you clearly didn t have the same childhood experience as a trans-man
also its not really respecting a group or identity if you only respect the  good ones
house of dragon is a good show.  shes doing a good job playing the role but the younger girl that played her character when she was younger did a better job imho.
I forgot the intersex community exists...I didn t even know they were a community
in times like these I am glad I dont read these modern trend media stuff....  I am glad my only child is 30 and didn t have to deal with the craziness when they were formulating their life...prisons....  yep...  the madness is just causing the society to spiral down and down...
really like your channel  just leaving a comment here for the algorithm.
as someone convinced by scripture that anything outside of the hetero marriage God instituted in genesis one to picture Christ married to the body  multitude  of believers  and affirmed all throughout the Bible  my stance on their  anything outside of that  behavior is this  I d be betraying my Christ and his word if I supported it in any way  so I will never  ever do that. however  outside of that  I will do whatever it takes to help the person in question  and in fact pray for their salvation and evangelize.
do you see how youre contradicting yourself here  though first   I was a tomboy  but just because I acted like a boy didn t make me one! a few moments later   I ll only accept transwomen if they look and behave exactly like stereotypical ciswomen. which is it  should it be socially acceptable for people to behave differently than their gender  or not a few other points    transition surgery on small children is opposed by practically everyone  including lgbt people.  all those crazy pronouns are almost exclusively a preteen tumblr thing. yes  preteens do weird  silly  and imaginative things to try to feel special. this is not indicative of the fall of society. find me a single lawmaker  professional pundit  or mainstream liberal speaker  anywhere  who has ever publicly supported any of those  dragonkin -type pronouns  and I ll eat my words.  are you going to have a fear of transwomen in bathrooms just because of the actions of a single person living in a prison   ciswomen in prison rape women too  doesnt that mean you should be afraid of all women in bathrooms
the difference between younger and older alicent and rhae actors  the younger ones expressed the characters as was natural  the older ones are there to send a clear political message.alicent s actress was told to play like a  woman supporting trump   rhae s actress is a non-binary person playing a free spirited and sexual character who breaks rules  and its clear which side is depicted as the  bad guys .the show still hasn t disappointed much but ep 6 made me worried. I guess we ll see.
@melonie keep going boom!!
there is no understanding with these lunatics. the more you try to please them or  understand  them the more they lash out on you. they re never satisfied.
hopefully she ll get more roles playing a man so she can get good at that too.
who the hell cares who somebody identifies with or as  why are you having a go at someone because they identify as this or that  is  she  trying to change the identity of others  is she pushing her  beliefs  on anyone else  plenty of that going around regardless of sex or gender. what you are doing is just vindictive without rhyme or reason. leave people the fuck alone.
I dont understand why this is a topic of conversation whatsoever. what does it have to do with us  speaking about it here and now  the fact thatsomeone  a third person  feels or not feels the need to make a change about themselves. its about themselves. what s our place in such an intimate choice  please someone explain because I just cant find an answer.
a good video  but my one criticism is that you said yourespect people s pronouns. I get why youre doing it and dont fault you for erring on the side of trying to be loving and compassionate  but I would argue that youre supporting their delusion when you do it. I have no beef with blaire  or anyone else who just wants to live their lives and not mutilate kids  but I would respectfully refuse to call him a her because I dont believe it is loving or compassionate to acknowledge a lie as truth.
as some dude said  common sense is not so common anymore think it was chappelle but I dont wanna put words in his mouth.
what discussion  there are only 2 genders. I got over the dreadlocks on the targaryans  but come on... its shocking the us has fallen to this level  Imean I adored the freedom aspect for years  but this is just out of hand. eastern european guy over here. seriously  girl  I cant believe you actually have to defend yourself over this  youre just making sense. also  the actress did a great job in  the role  she should ve just lead with that  not with  the message .
mac mommy drops the boom
really weird behavior to make a 25 minute long video about not knowing the difference between assigned sex at birth and gender and then frame it as concern for children.
dont know if you ll read this  but here s my 2 cents  the fundamental divide between the anti-trans and pro-trans position  is the question over whether sex is synonymous with gender. the anti-trans position says sex  as defined by chromosomes  has final say on the identity of a person  and therefore is absolutely synonymous with gender with no room for outliers. whereas the pro-trans positions says gender can be defined independent of chromosomes  according to a person s neurological makeup. so really  the crux of the issue is there s a tension between two physical traits  one being your chromosomes  and one being your neurology. which is why itsounds silly when trans critics say  you cant change what you were born with!.  well  thats precisely the problem  isn t it  they were born with a physical brain that doesnt match their physical body. so that rhetoric doesnt seem very helpful or constructive for their predicament. so the argument over this issue is really an extension of one s philosophical view of the brain. how much primacy does it have over other physical variables  how much primacy does your chromosomes have over your identity  can one be divorced from the other  the brain is a complicated thing  and itstands to reason that there would be a lot of confusion  dissent  and disagreement over the role of this complex organ. the most complex organ on the planet.
period.
there s a big difference here. a biological woman can wear a man s t shirt and jeans and still present as female  because she is biologically female and clothing does not change that nor even give the illusion of otherwise. however  if a biological male who identifies as a transgender woman wears male clothing then said person will present as male  because biologically they are. the key point here is that in this example  transgender women are not the same as biological women. therefore  if a biological male wants to be accepted in society as female  then efforts have to be made to present as such  otherwise you run into a lot of issues especially regarding the safety of biological women. its just how it is. if one is going to live a life that contradicts their biology  then in order to function in society as smoothly and safely as possible  there s gotta be some effort. otherwise every single person on earth has to wear pronoun name tags  and gender will be completely irrelevant  in which case we may as well all identify as amorphous blobs and ignore biology altogether. we cant bend the entire world and society to the few who suffer with gender dysphoria  or any other conditions for that matter. we can be kind  but we still have to be practical as well  for safety reasons among many other things.
if you actually watched my video you d have heard the answers to your question here lol
just cause emma and most other binary do whatever they do with their life and decisions doesnt mean she and others like her get to force people to say what they want to give them validation. what about the rights of people who are told to do or say something or else  something as trivial as pronouns should not be enforced on people who dont want to say pronouns regardless of whether you want them to or not.
11 00 why do these gender-obsessed people always look and sound like they are in some sort of cult  the hairstyles  the clothes  the make-up  the wide-eyed  spaced-out look on their faces  and they way they talk. its like looking at aliens trying to imitate humans  but they only got to look at twitter and tiktok for reference. its freaking me out  and whenever I see someone with a septim piercing  this specific style of clothes  makeup  or hairstyle  I want to stay as far away from them as I possibly can. or when I hear somebody say weird stuff such as   we need some personpower  instead of  we need some manpower   for example. its weird as hell.
man of the year
just look at the miserable look on this things face. imagine living your life that way. I grew up in the 70s and 80s  a male. I learned to cook  sew  knit  and other  female  things. nobody tried to tell me that I was a girl because I learned to do this  people just let me do the things that made me happy at the time. I also played ninjas and rambo down the bush along side a couple of girls that were hanging out with us and nobody ever told them they were boys for enjoying smacking each other with home made swords and crawling around in creeks. they let us grow up.the irony of it all is that it is the same people that are so abusive about   assigning genders  at birth that are making sure that very young children are made to pick a path dependant on what hobbies or colours they like.
every 60 seconds a minute passes in africa
feminist or not  terf values are based in the idea that that amab people cant be women  and that afab people cant be anything other than women. its 2022  and a lot of people still dont seem to understand that gender   sex. so yes  the ignorance is still there. regardless of how  common  it is  its not harmless. I think the reason thatsome people are surprised or confused by emma saying this about their acting career is not realizing that the experiences of a non-binary person dont necessarily line up with a cis woman s  for those of you that dont know  cis just means that you identify with your assigned sex at birth . and  therefore  emma plays people who s individual experiences aren t really  comparable  to their identity  but still enjoys playing them on screen. obviously   she her  doesnt describe the way emma feels about themselves on an individual level   but I would say that their ability to play and express someone who does express themselves this way says a lot about their versatility. what I think emma also means  though less directly  is that they re good at playing women who are caught in the political trappings of a society that works against them  and a lot of their characters do reflect this.edit  I did just also want to mention that most trans gender-nonconforming kids know pretty early on that they re trans or nb. they knew that their identity didn t really match up with how they were expected to present  and that didn t really change as they got older. most trans people will tell you this. the need to push the word  tomboy  on trans kids is born out of this idea that kids cant know when their gender is mismatched  even it it ll affect them their whole lives  and that  its just a phase!  to detract from the reality that  yes  kids can be trans  and its not something we need to treat as a bogeyman. if they re trans  then they ll always be trans.     there s a habitsome people have of saying   I did boy stuff  but I didn t turn out to be a boy!  but thats probably because they didn t deal with gender dysphoria  lol. being trans goes way beyond that. also  nobody is performing gender affirming surgery on children. the surgeons who do this are aware as anyone that a child cant consent to this procedure  even with parental permission. this is misinformation that mostly gets circulated by people who know nothing about the transition process to begin with. what does happen is that preteens teens can elect to go through hormone therapy because its a lot more difficult to transition after puberty  and some people  especially intersex people  dont even have a regular developmental stage of puberty  so it has to be started somehow.
wait  so she s not a woman but is portraying woman roles  shouldn t activists be protesting her  they protest johannsen portraying a trans person because she was taking a role from some unnamed trans actress. isn t this person taking a role from some unnamed woman  obviously  the whole line of  logic  is idiotic because if you follow it far enough actors will only be able to portray themselves. Im just saying people who aren t as lazy as I should make a stink about this to let hollywood know about geese and ganders.
another day of conservatives being terrified of hypothetical situations that do not happen. great!
I dont like your apologizing tone melonie... to draw a line you have to be tougher  you dont have to apologize to this animals that doesnt even know how to think. and you are still part of the problem when you say that when a person is an adult can do whatever they want with their body and with their life. if they were real adults they wouldn t be thinking like delusional or crazy people in the first place  and if something is wrong or very wrong for children it is also for this supposed adults. if you dont call it full force dont bother at all  because guess what  it all started with people like you saying  when you are an adult you can do whatever you want  then its ok and I dont have a problem with it ...also stop saying that you were a tomboy to justify or validate what you are saying as a woman   because truth has no gender.I understand your frustration but you seem too worried about people going against you even when you say that you dont. I can assure you that when they are going to mutilate some children they couldn t care less about anything that you said here  especially when even you say that if your are an adult  your can do whatever you want .you know how exactly it all started   when people was afraid to say that being gay or lesbian is not normal and goes against nature just to not hurt some feelings. and it doesnt mean that they have to be hunted or punished for it. when you are not able to call something as it is you are welcoming all this nonsense and craziness to come right through that door. and thats exactly what s happening.
as an atheist Im concerned about all off that
you were so close...  or maybe not  dont you think that maybe being non-binary is a way for non-cis or people that dont feel completely comfortable in the societal idea of gender  to erase the problem and just feel however they want to feel  wear whatever they want  and failing to gender in general. how is that offensive to intersex people  the non-binary wave on the contrary will give intersex people an opportunity to finally feel like they dont have to be put in the pink or blue box. I understand the feeling of having too many labels nowadays  but the final goal for the queer community is the erasure of gender and of any box we have to be put in. the boxes are needed just because of how society is. the goal is living and letting people live  and stop acting as if any of this is creating problems for you!! and let me be honest with you  comparing liberty of gender with religion is honestly a joke
I respect an adult s right to choose but let the children be children.  a child cannot make a choice to forever change their bodies.  if they want  as you said  to have interests and etc. usually thought of as those of one gender or the other  let them.  do not force choices upon them that have life altering consequences at an age they cannot possibly fathom those consequences.  for the record I am a gay male but  that does not require me t accept the things that the extreme woke present.  also  as for the pronouns  I am supportive of legitimate trans people but  I cannot do the they them non-binary stuff. although this comment may not reflect it  I identify as a grammar nazi.  what about my rights and feelings   I am not even being facetious.  I wince every time I try to use a plural pronoun for a singular person.
trying to be respectful with my honest questions. if you or someone could answer because I am new here. why are other adults using alternative pronouns a concern  if its not something you have to mentally battle with then why let it get under your skin  also  those who do reach the conclusion to use they them  do you think they may know themselves and may have gotten there through professional help  these are genuine questions meant for discussion. since I am a straight female and these things dont bug me I d truly like to know why they bother someone else similar to me.
love your hair btw
you look so much better and more genuine when you dont paint fake eyelashes on your face.
the idea that we need to fit into a specific box in regards to gender or sexuality is a construct thatsociety has created and enforced over decades. gender and sexuality are fluid - how a person expresses that has absolutely no bearing on your life whatsoever. your opinions about non-binary folks are so reductive its almost laughable. a person that is non-binary feels totally at odds with their gender  several of my close friends identify as non-binary and I have had insightful conversations with them on their experiences . it has nothing to do with the color pink or because they dont like to play with dolls. I dont believe you have the right to discredit or invalidate anyone s gender identity  because you have not lived or experienced their lives. maybe you should try empathizing with these individuals rather than taking time out of your day to roast them on the internet.
I d call this show a solid 8.5-9 10  but I really need to just take the show as it is and largely ignore the nonsense spouted by some of the people working on it. as long as you put out good show  think whatever you want. just dont ruin a good thing. to the actor s credit  though  I actually do quite like adult rhaenyra. as much as I enjoyed the younger actor who played her  the behavior of the younger version of that character was often not befitting of a future ruler. ironically  having kids actually made her mature and grow as a person  and because of the actor s performance  I could actually believe thatshe would make a better ruler than  say  aegon iI  even if we didn t already know about his rape of the servant girl and leaving his bastard child to the fighting pits .
non-binary person here! I get that this doesnt come from a place of hatred and I just wanted to give my opinion on the topic. the problem is that what yourefer to as  common sense  is just heteronormative thinking  in this case meaning that what we call man or woman depends on the physical appearance of a person  and that is a tricky way of conceiving gender. when looking at different cultures and time periods one can find that indeed the definition of masculinity and or femininity change overtime  sometimes even contradicting each other. what Imean to say is that you cant really pin down gender as merely one thing made up of arbitrary archetypes. if you felt like a tomboy growing up and then stopped feeling that way its completely fine  precisely because no one cantell you how to express your feminity gender. given the centuries of homophobia and queer erasure  there are certain thigs that we pass off as  common sense   but really are internalised homophobia. and youre not to blame  even queer people experience internalised homophobia  and that is  I think  one of the most difficult issues for the lgbtq  community nowadays. moreover  I think that a big problem with the whole gender stereotypes issue is that  while some people can say that they dont matter  others are heavily impacted by them. coming out as non-binary and presenting myself in a more gender-bent way  inside a country that is very homophobic  paraguay   I did struggle a lot because there was a label over me thatsaid I was one of the traditional genders  and people got very confused and upset  even my family insulated me and called me names  besides refusing to take me seriously when talking about me being non-binary and insisting of me to come out  even though I was very much not ready to do it. so my point is  usually gender stereotypes only dont matter for some people  not everyone. I dont think acknowledging them when talking about queer genders is reinforcing them  but just understanding that it is still a problem
heck dont think this will ever stop with all the pronoun stuff and new ones will be made. these folks cant separate mentally who they are to what they are physically.
also grew up in the 80s and also 90s  girliest girl you d ever see but I played with bugs outside and had ninja turtle clothes and action figures. and I tried to learn carpentry from my grandfather  as well. back then  labels were rejected and discouraged. now... they re mandatory for kids. no wodner they re messed up.
she s not saying that  she s saying just cause you went through a sex change or if youre binary doesnt mean they cantell you what you should or shouldn t say to give them validation. there s a double standard. do what you want with you body but dont sit there and force people to change they re speech cause your basically doing the very things that actual ignorant mean people do to them.
@azraiel 1984  but why do people think they re forced to used these pronouns  Ive never had a trans or non binary person force me to use their pronouns  only present them to me. Ive never seen them visibly upset if someone does not use their pronouns or if I slip up because they know they physically look a certain way when they feel a different way. they ve validated themselves already by choosing their own gender. I guess I dont understand where there is a double standard. also why does emma d arcy s comment upset people if it doesnt affect them
thank you. I dont understand why people are taking time arguing things that are not even about them... this actually doesnt make sense. live your life and let people do the same with their own.
freedom of speech if not freedom of consequence. if you decide to give your opinion you have to also accept that may have repercussions. freedom of speech is only valid against the establishment  not against other civilians
and transkids transchildren  um thats not a thing. - eric d july
I dont think you are evil but you dont understand things on a deep enough level. you aren t a doctor or psychologist but just a person with an opinion. for starters    non-binary isn t the same as transgender and not all of them transition.
Im curious why you felt 25 mins wouldn t be notice as intentional as it obviously was
I hate to break it to you  but you are living in a horrible bubble full of labels that make you. what makes you actually nervous and scared about their statement is actually the idea thatsomeone broke the bubble  created by patriarchy you are still in but probably wont realize it anytime soon.  you literally made a video about someone who throw out all your labels to the trashcan  and completely accepted the person who they are. what does itsays about your self acceptance
true dat true dat. well put
you can say whatever you want  but I dont think its your place to decide what people identify as. you understand there s an erasure genocide campaign against transgender and queer people in this country do you not  despite all the media visibility  there s still little in the way of substantive protections for these people but there is much violence being done to them. I d like to think someone half-native could understand the seriousness of this. I wonder how you d like it if people started questioning that about you  to the point where you even begin to doubt it yourself  this idea of biological gender sounds ridiculous to me  as well as unscientific. my understanding is that gender is the presentation and pronouns someone uses  and sex organs are biological. these things most of the time are in alignment  but other times not. why is itsuch a problem to have a society which supports rather than ostracize  alienate  or even eliminate such people  perhaps the latter feels more natural here. after all  indigenous people have a history of gender non-conformity and the theft of their land and genocide continues today. Im sure they would be disappointed to hear you speak this way. in regards to the violence in prisons  if you think that gender non-conforming people are responsible for horrible prison violence  I d be inclined to suggest youre missing the forest for the trees. do youreally think filthy detention camps with inadequate provisions  and contracts with corporations to exploit prisoners for cheap labor are going to bring out the best in people  let alone solve the problem of crime  come on. your only point that I find myself in agreement with is that I do think that taking hormones or getting surgery should probably wait until youre at least old enough to get a tattoo. however  I do not think that the kids already transitioned should be forcibly de-transitioned. thats still more coercion and more damage. I also think the  woke  movement of bastardized identity politics and social justice could stand to do better outreach and education so that people like you can get curious rather than defensive. your stances bother me  but Im not just going to get triggered and  reee  about it. I d much prefer to meet you where youre at  and maybe you ll reconsider. if not oh well. I too desire a society which recognizes free speech  and thats why Ive made such a lengthy response  and I couldn t give a fuck less about whatever hate this gets me. thank you.
hear! hear!
why are you so obsessed with other people s identities and gender  live and let live. Christians believe  and have killed millions in the name of  a magical palestinian carpenter is God  the son of a God  and a magical spirit. I dont see you screeching about them.
as a fellow Christian mel let me just encourage you by saying that if we re not being persecuted we probably aren t standing up for Christ. God bless and stay faithful.
yes  she can use whatever pronouns she wants  and like grammarly  melonie will continue to correct her.
welcome to the dark side.dont worry we have cookies.
I had no idea about this  before watching this video. one thing I ll say in emma s favour is that it doesnt affect her acting  and her portrayal of rhaenyra is fairly good. its also up to her how she wants to live her life  but let s face it  its woke nonsense.
thank you for going boom.
I got some serious criticism for this lgbt movement and their push for adding the maps.
I love how you  as a cis woman  are speaking for intersex  nb  trans and agender people. you know nothing about their experiences  yet you insist on speaking over the actual voices who do. if intersex people had an issue with non binary people  they d say so. instead  its cis woman. and then you have the audacity to say youre not a bigot and incredibly transphobic. the fact that you made a 25 min video simply because youre scared of pronouns and non cis people existing shows this.
so you dont like wokeness but then show the opposite you cant go boom and then claim yourespect transgender pronouns. friend or not  you gave the enemy all the ammo they needed.the whole trans thing is absurd  and they know it. thats why they ve gone out of their way to seek validation. you calling one gender the opposite gives credibility to this nonsense. everybody compromising little by little is all it takes.
funny how  they them  is not a thing in french..
I like how d arcy says she uses they them as pronouns but in the quote she uses I Im.  its just an indicator that they cant even formulate a proper sentence with the pronouns they say they use.
I will never play along. looks like a fight is on the horizon. the sane vs the insane.
based point
thats what fist are for. fist meets face  such a lovely couple
I agree with bikers on this one. live free or die.
just use  -wise  at the end of a word you aren t sure how to correctly modify in the context of your grammatical sentence  and you can avoid saying things like  grammarly  and we ll never have to have this conversation again!
@cmcadvanced  grammarly is literally a popular grammar correction app and website. not to mention  the word is capitalized  making it a proper pronoun  which means  its a  person  place  or thing  as hinted by the statement   and like  grammarly  melonie will continue to correct her   which fully implies that grammarly must be something or someone that corrects sentences and  perhaps  grammar.next time  google a capitalized word thatseems to imply something  and you ll never have to have this conversation again!
@cmcadvanced  good thing I shut off all replies  because we never had a conversation from the start.  so much for your   again .
how is it woke nonsense
no such thing as non-binary.
@stolenzombie  oh I guess Im a ghost who doesnt exist then
@peut- tre toi  a ghost and  non-binary   I hope you get some help.
@peut- tre toi  says the one who believes in  non-binary
@stolenzombie  cope
@peut- tre toi  allegedly.
I dont think every transgender person does it for attention  though a lot to. but ultimately gender dysphoria is a mental issue that can really hurt those experiencing it. I dont think its ideal by any means and I always would encourage people to accept themselves as they were born to be  but when I see someone legitimately suffering with it I just cant bring myself to not be polite. I dunno  maybe that makes me a little woke  but despite woke people trying to tell me I am so evil for my opinions  Im actually a very sensitive person and I just cant bring myself to knock people down who are genuinely suffering. its a tough subject and I honestly dont know how to act all the time about it  but I try my best to balance having compassion without encouraging self harm
@melonie mac go boom  sure we can assume a combination of attention  pressure  and or severe mental illness. whatever the reason  itseems at some point we thought the compassionate thing to do is feed into their delusions. these people actually need focused help... not society uprooting itself to cater to this pretend-gender bs. its not on you or me to affirm these people. thats not our job. its possible respect people as human beings without having to join in on their preferred labels. people have legal names. thats not disrespectful to use. if that person demands otherwise  then they re disrespectful.we should never have to compromise our beliefs for this inherently antI Christian movement. if reality and simple questions dismisses their entire belief system  then its something we need to do without. it doesnt make you a bad person to uphold your values  it makes them bad for expecting you to change yours.
why would they use a third person pronoun when talking about themselves in the first person
@ethan dalton  because that is how they identify themselves. if you identify as they them then you cant talk about yourself as a she her. they have to use pronoun they identify as. and in this case by not doing that contradicts what she said to begin with.
@john schrieber  good thing they didn t do that then. they use I  not she her.
@ethan dalton  cannot use I either. if you identify as they them then that is all you can use as that is how you identify as. you cant say I went to the market. you have to say they went to the market or them went to the market. basically by identifying as they them it restricts the pronoun usage one can use.
@john schrieber but surely that means people who use he him or she her  cant use I either  because they are the gendered equivalents of they them.
@ethan dalton  thats the problem identifying like that. kind of hard to make a proper sentence when you limit your vocabulary on pronouns when you identify yourself.  makes the whole thing about identifying silly in the first place.
@john schrieber  they ve not limited their vocabulary  you ve just decided that.
yourespect the pronouns of trans women as long as they can afford immense medical bills to transition  sucks if youre a poor trans person I guess
people can have  freedom of speech  but it doesnt mean  freedom to hurt . if someone says  call me melonie  and I say  no I ll call you hooverface  that just makes me a jerk. let adults do what they want. and kids are not doing whatever they want - they only make gender decisions with the support of many adults. of course  their lives can be unpleasant when denied thatsupport.
as a child  I would have loved having the language to describe what I felt and examples to let me know that I wasn t alone. that goes for my same sex attraction. a shit ton of children know how they feel before they have the language and end up  like me  despairing in solitude. there are child appropriate ways to talk about these subjects
this woke movement is having your eyes open but youre facing a wall.and its scary because its slowly creeping in to my country.
people who are genderqueer often think experience gender and gender signifiers as almost a performance because they dont connect to it in a personal way  but rather become fluent in the social language.also I dont see what emma has to do with  mutilating children . if you were well versed in this issue  you would know more about the process of gender affirming care  because no one is performing gender reassignment surgeries on minors.
yo @melonie mac go boom my mind and yours are linked girl I thought  how you would look without make up and here we are  switch it up I love it
I dont get why you are making a whole video on this. its really got nothing to do with you how other people express themselves. and youre not going to change anything by shaming or denying the existence of people who are non-binary. its here. its not going away anytime soon. may as well accept it. there are far far greater issues going on in the world than someone s gender that has nothing to do with you. is it really that much of a stretch to imagine thatsome people dont fit into the boxes of man and woman
updating language to better describe experience  even by using wacky pronouns  I wont say made up because all language is technically made up  doesnt actually hurt anybody
what I dont understand about emma d arcy is that while she identifies as non-binary  her partner is a man. so  essentially she s just a normal woman that just likes dressing abit more masculine. like why identify as non-binary  her relationship is a binary relationship. man and a woman. its like she just took the label as non-binary to be special or something. like being a woman does not mean you have to adhere to gender roles and stereotypes. its a function of biology.
talk to  em mel!
a woman who can play a woman. wow  wonders never cease
thatshits super funny.
who gives you the right to speak for people who are intersex  is this your own experience  no  then why would you know anything about what intersex people think about non-binary people  no one asked for you to be their spokesperson  so stop using vulnerable communities to boost up your youtube revenue. you speak a lot about  your opinions   this is not really about opinions for you  or freedom of speech  its about making money.
you are a  turf  totally unbelievably real fantastic
while I disagree on the fact that there must be a genetic cause for dysphoria  I agree with the criticisms about how many people are abusing the whole gender identity thing in media  from the  humble  tiktok to cinema  just to raise that view count.I also agree on how wrong it is to force the view of adults on children  even if its usually in the opposite direction you pointed out  with parents forcing their children into cis identities  to the point of abusing and or disowning them if they turn out different from what the parents want.with that being said  people need to understand the difference between gender dysphoria and personal tastes and hobbies!you can be a male and still like what are considered feminine things  you can be a female and still like what are considered masculine things.I am a cis male and still like my little pony. did I doubt even for a second my gender identity because of this  no!gender identity is something serious and shouldn t be taken lightly.gender identity is something serious and shouldn t be imposed.
all you should say to them in reply is  thankyou for your projection.
I am not going to respect anyone s insanity. those who identify as something they are not are out of their minds  and should be treated as such.
I got zed zer zem em them was really born to act in women roles.
I also wanna add thatstraight cisgnder men pretending to be lgbt to gain access to vulnerable women is not the fault of  nor related to  actual queen people. thats like by definition a problem of straight men  dont blame shift.
honestly  I dont think transitioning is the solution to gender disphoria  it just seems like reinforcing it. if someone with anorexia saw themselves as terribly fat even though that wasn t reflected in reality  the solution wouldn t be  let s give them liposuction so that they feel better.sometimes  I wonder if tolerating it hasn t been part of the problem. shouldn t we just have been honest from the beginning  Im not sure what you feel but I definetely see a man in front of me  not a woman.and honestly  I genuinely want to know what others think  it absolutely isn t my intention to hate anyone though I know some will choose to interprete this statement that way.the mind is a powerful thing. thats why there is such a thing as the placebo effect. if we allow people to brainwash themselves into believing something that patently isn t true  how is thatsomehow more loving than to just tell them the truth
intersectionality for the win baby

in my community the black community. you got females out here saying that the black studs are out here being better daddy s than the men. yet the studs are still females that have a nurturing trait in them as mothers lol.
rally the woke mob
as someone who had always being a left liberal  the past years made me 100  apolitical  both sides of the political spectrum are just unberable and annoying  both sides takes smirky jabs towards one another and both sides have their share of denial against reality  ask the religious right if evolution and climate change is real most will squeek lol
they are all challenged and not in touch with reality. its crazy that anyone would lick their ego and nonsense.
you say you want a reasonable conversation then read what I have to say... all of it. dont confuse uncomfortable with confrontational... truths can be hard to accept sometimes.  if you have to start off your video with  Im not a bigot ... then you have already admitted the truth whether yourealize it or not. this is exactly like when people start off a conversation with  Im not racist but...  then proceed to be racist. people who are not bigots  racists  sexists  or homophobes... dont start off conversations that way  and the reason is simple because they dont make racist  sexist  or homophobic remarks so have no reason to begin the conversation with such a strange yet very revealing disclaimer. I dont care how people identify in terms of sexuality or who they choose to love... thats because it doesnt affect me  and regardless of what you may believe  it doesnt affect you either. you cant have your cake and eat it too... if you attack people for their sexual orientation or for how they identify  then you are a bigot because that is what bigotry is regardless of whether you agree or not. this is self evident and shouldn t need explaining. freedom of speech is a right granted to you by the us constitution which protects your ability to speak out against the government. it does not protect you from people calling you a bigot in the comments section of your videos. it does not protect you from being banned by companies who have terms of service agreements  like youtube or twitter  because they are not the government. if a person goes to work and calls their coworker vile names and personally attacks them... they can get fired for that. again  this should never need explaining.  this is a good example of how seriously flawed your arguments are... if you make simple mistakes like this  then what does thatsay about everything else  itsays you dont think through the logic of your arguments carefully.    what you fail to realize is your approach to constructing arguments is based on flawed logic that can be extended to literally every single thing in society concerning every aspect of people s lives. I could say people who get tattoos exhibit poor judgement so shouldn t be allowed to serve in the military or as firefighters because they are impulsive and would be a threat to the others around them due to their erratic behavior... because that is my opinion and is based on what I deem to be common sense. this is literally the entire basis of your reasoning. see how I can wantonly target whoever I want and provide  valid  reasons for why I feel the way I do  arguments similar to these were utilized to oppose women s suffrage  to oppose women serving in the military  to oppose things we now see as uncontroversial. extermination camps were created by men who also claimed their arguments were based on common sense and not simply the product of bigotry... and the reasons they gave for why some people were a threat to society back then were just as arbitrary as the arguments used nowadays to target new groups. you say you dont like when they flaunt their sexual identity  okay  so what about when people who you consider normal heterosexuals flaunt their sexuality  I guarantee you dont mind then... in fact  I know it. so why the difference  because your comments and actions betray how youreally feel. your reasoning is solely based on logic  that is a lie. take this part here at 2 04 where you blink your eyes. even a child would understand that this is derision and that you are doing so solely to demean the actress. that isn t formulating an counterargument based on logic. you say one thing... then act in an opposing manner.  I know why you say you dont hate anyone... because in your mind bigotry cant exist without hatred  so you feel that this provides a way for you to claim that it is impossible for you to be a bigot. except bigotry can exist without hatred. these are valid concerns for your freedom of speech  do you not realize that this isn t even remotely related to your point  do you not realize thatstatement has literally nothing to do with holding a position for or against non-binary identity  yeah... that is the  logic  and  common sense  you claim justifies your position and leads to your conclusions. but the simple truth is no matter how you try to justify or reason it  in the end this is bigotry plain and simple. there is no getting around it. if you think anything I have said is wrong... then I encourage you to look up the definition for words like bigotry and prejudice in a dictionary. you cant have your cake and eat it too.
so Im a libertarian. classically left leaning. I have views on both sides of the spectrum. so when it comes to the woke stuff Im a live and let live kind of mentality. do what makes you happy so long as it doesnt hurt others. my main issue with the woke bs is that the whole reason why it even happened is because they felt like they were being attacked by others for their lifestyle choices. now I see it from them. the same crap that they saw themselves to be a victim of. pushing their ideology onto other people and attacking those who dont agree with it. shit is wild  and the way that their ideology is attacking kids right now is absolutely creepy.
get a new joke
everything you said was a personal accusation  attack about my character and absolutely nothing debating the actual topic at hand  which further proves the point Ive been making lol
lmao @ tryin to tell a libertarian her right is granted by a piece of paper
the only truth in that rambling specious mess of a comment is that there is enough straw to build an army.
@tim mauntler  it doesnt matter how she or anyone else views it... because the piece of paper does exactly that. the rights she or anyone else enjoys... doesnt come from thin air as this is not how the real world works. if it isn t granted by the paper... she doesnt have the right.
@unknownmovements  if a piece of paper granted you the right to live  would you consider it a right granted to you  or would you know that it is your right to simply exist  if we still had the right to own slaves  would you consider it our right
@tim mauntler  none of this needs explaining. when she made the comment about her right to freedom of speech  I simply pointed out that is only a right granted by the government which protects her from the government restricting her speech. it does not protect her from others challenging her views or from an online platform banning her for her views. she of course can say whatever she wants... nobody is claiming there is a law which prevents her from sharing her beliefs. the reason I stated this is people like her nowadays are claiming online platforms dont have the right to ban her because her speech is protected and that is simply incorrect because it is only protected from government restriction and nothing else.  you are confusing what inalienable rights represent. the right to life is above human law... this is something that both scholars and layman will agree upon. but claiming others cant challenge her speech with their own speech is a insane position and obviously a contradictory one that doesnt infringe upon her inalienable rights. and that is what I am pointing out here because that is what she is trying to argue. she is trying to claim she is above reproach and she simply is not. her freedom of speech is protected only against government interference not from other s challenging her speech with their own. now  to your second point. this now falls under inalienable rights  the right to liberty  but in the past did not. that doesnt mean anything changed with the underlying truth... itsimply means there was a time when the majority of individuals in certain societies viewed it in that manner and so wrote laws codifying it. in thatsense alone it was a right granted to a segment of society living under the law and who themselves subscribed to because they wrote the laws. and I want to clarify this... that is not an argument implying it was just. what you are simply ignoring yet know very well is that there are countries around the world who have laws that others view as barbaric and inhumane. those laws grant some entity a right. take a country like iran which enforces the death penalty for breaking laws like robbery or homosexuality. those laws are rights... doesnt mean they are just but they are rights. you are simply confusing what it means to have a right under the laws of a country as opposed to inalienable rights... just because you feel a certain way about something doesnt mean it is magically a law if it isn t codified within some state or federal law. otherwise  people could constantly claim they are free to do literally anything they wanted without repercussion any time they break some law and have to appear in court. and guess what  courts dont recognize such arguments... and for obvious reasons. you can codify that belief into a law if you can convince enough people to share your stance on some issue and it then becomes codified  which of course we do . then it is an actual right as opposed to what you think is your right. so.... her speech isn t protected from other people s speech  and to claim otherwise is obvious hypocrisy. are we done here
@unknownmovements  its really not as complicated as youre trying to make it. Imade fun of your using an argument that holds no weight against a libertarian.
@tim mauntler  well  I can only respond to the comments people provide as an argument they seem to be presenting as their own.
@unknownmovements  fair enough
waitso youre a live and let live but not when it comes to gay trans childrencurious
@b atrice ghattas  you seem nice.
hit that thumbs
I dont really think you are in place to talk about someone else s experience with their gender. here emma d arcy is not addressing or attacking anyone  but their own experiences. you on the other hand... and this is  coming from someone who is a fan of right wing figures like blair white.
you guys remember when gillette made their antIman ad  saying  where knocking down gender stereotypes!  then owned themselves in spectacular fashion when they made their razors for women and put the pink label on it  further reinforcing the gender stereotype colors  I remember that!

I have a 5yr old daughter and half the time she wishes she was a wolf  but Im not going to start keeping her in a cage  feeding her from a dog bowl and playing fetch with her.  there are other children that wish they were dinosaurs and whatever else you canthink of  but that is the main thing....they are children!  they have no fucking clue about the world or themselves.  we have to be there to prepare them for when they are adults and then  they can make these long term decisions.  my daughter will live her life learning who she is  and that also includes who she might have feelings for.  but  anything that might include permanent changes physically will happen when she is an actual adult  and has lived the life she was born to.  then  I will still be there for her to support whatever she wants to do.  I love how everyone out there wants to shove certain statistics in your face about how they see things  but when you try to counter  and have a conversation  with statistics that goes against what they believe  then they loose their minds.  the main the statistics I am talking about  and that goes with the whole conversation that has been going on  is that people love to bring up that there is a large suicide rate for people that want to be the opposite sex and they think that it would have helped if all those people went through the procedure.  the facts they dont want to admit is that there is still a high rate of suicide for people that have transitioned.  meaning  they are still missing something in their life and just because they had a permanent procedure doesnt mean it was the answer.
honestly  I dont care what actors think. they re paid to dress up and pretend. turning to them for anything is like asking the court jester for advice back in the dark ages.

thank you for not staying silent on this bs.
I literally said in this video  I cant speak on emma darcy s experience  if you actually watched it lol
@melonie mac go boom  Im sorry but the whole thing was very condescending at the end. I totally understand your point but I really dont find the article to be a forced statement  and its okay not to agree with someone else s view on gender but that doesnt mean we need to undermine them.
@melonie mac go boom  so far emma s take on their gender has been less impactful or controversial that  say  morfyd s take on rop wokeness as of late.
everyone is on the right place to talk about whatever they want  especially if they think its ridiculous. this is ridiculous
@cmcadvanced  who says she has not right to it  saying her take on this matter is very biased does not equal Im trying to censor her.
@m w  yeah  I just think youre being a ninny
@cmcadvanced  dont worry dude  she s only going to give you a thumbs up  nothing more.
you look great what did do with your make up.
go boom!!!!!!
imagine my shock when a woman has to proclaim thatshe s good at playing gasp! women.
fuckn right mel
non-binary  my ass. she s a chick playing a chick. stunning and brave.
holy shit hahahahah
I subbed your on to something they lost there minds somewhere along the way
they dont even try to hide the illuminatI imagery at the top of that vox article
I love how they love throwing the term  terf  around  as if its even an insult. like no  Im not into gender larping  thanks.
who predicted this stuff  genuinely curious.
yes water is wet lol.
these type of people are going to put a noticeable dent in the american population.
what does  her gynecologist think about it
it used to be  I like being a total bitch  or Im an arsehole  and Im good at it
projection because they feel rejection.
Imade the same joke as you. because surely emma was joking too right    also  unless you are a conjoined twin you are not  they them  its a damn plural!!  its he she.   also  its just my opinion and thats allowed - emma isn t very good at portraying a man so best to carry on pretending to be a  woman  ...
well I dont know everybody s names who have ever said these things  but in my 35 years of life I remember a lot of discourse between two sides of the subject and many things people argued would happen 10 or even 20 years ago are happening now  but those who said this would happen were called crazy
they  can also be singular
you have a personal opinion on a  social  media platform  cancel her now! lol. yeah I agree they are gaslighting common sense but then they are lighting a match afterwards to make sure nothing is left.  the best vision of what our society is headed towards is the movie demolition man. be well melonie mac.
a woman....hypes herself up on her ability to act the part of a woman  thats where we are at now  lol  gaslighting our common sense.  well said melonie

more like an identity crisis
so question as a fellow Christian there s one thing I found weird that you said that you call transgenders the pronouns they wanna be called but how is that fully Christ like Im not trying to start a argument but just seeing why you feel thats the right thing to do as a Christian. I feel like I didn t word that as best as I could but hopefully you understand
well im sure you wont have a bunch of ppl knocking on your door lol
dont worry you are not alone. I am not religious person but I always let everyone believe to whatever they want  as long as it not causing damage or harm to others around them. and that was always same for their confusion about gender etc. al long as it is not enforced on others  I have never had an issue with it. but now it is effecting kids. and kids do as they are told. mainly because they do not know better. I would be always okay if you wanna transition with surgery as adult go for it. but please lets leave kids to be kids! ... it brings me huge amount of grief see how we are forced into celebration of mutilation of our future generations. I believe it is up to us to say enough is enough. I know there are people that need help and cant find any other option than surgery. but I believe most of these newly founded transgenders are just people exploiting system for attention.
when a bigot calls someone else a bigot because they are bigots  the irony is very strong

its so funny cause house of the dragon is actually a fantastic show but I swear whenever I see an interview with one of the actors or directors . they bring up something stupid about modern gender politics . just shut the hell up guys dont ruin your own show
haha you said wokeology
well
Im 45 this s    s all so confusing
my favorite pronoun is you.
boom!!
human beings aren t clownfish
wow  how brave of you
@b atrice ghattas  thanks I thought it was a good spot to draw the line
@andrew b  hey  if Imay engage with you genuinely here  where have you seen people denying the reality of chromosomes  without the acknowledgement that biological sex is real  the concept of being trans or non-binary wouldn t make sense. to have a gender identity different from the one you were assigned at birth  so the one based on biological sex  you need to recognize the role that biology plays in assigned gender. the point is that your biology and your gender identity are two different things.
@b atrice ghattas   hey I just engaged passive aggressively with you and several people here  but I would like to be genuine now  kk    odious doesnt even begin to describe your personality.
@andrew b  yeah  not my finest moment  to be sure   I probably wont be able to respond in any way thats adequate to you  so have a good day
@b atrice ghattas  I dont engage with bullies or thugs. you already revealed you were disingenuous with your first reply to me. part of what gives your side of the argument such a bad reputation.
its annoying af. they need to just be actors and stop ranting about stuff
we live in a era people use your opinions to dumb you down or even make you look like an 18th century villain who poisoned an entire city
it is common sense for sane people. these people are insane. period.
she looks like elon musk mid transition. funny that they always demand us normal people to  accept  them  but they never even accepted themselves as they are. ironic.
boom!
modern world is heavily weighted towards impotency. actions have few positive and a lot of negative consequences. it is no longer about the truth of the matter and what somebody did  but about how everyone else views their actions. social media  tv and wide spread internet changed perception of modern humanity  where words  loud shouts  catchphrases and taglines are more important and have a heavier impact than actions. it doesnt matter what anybody does  only how loud they scream about it and how many people shout in unison with them.the loudest crowd is often the minority  but because they percieve themselves to be the biggest  baddest and loudest  they believe themselves to be right  regardless if it is true or not. so now they woke crowd makes up all the pronouns and mental illnesses  without having the physical evidence for itso they will be accepted into the community and they begin living in an echochamber of simialr people who seek acceptance by turning away from reality and sinking deeper into the delusions.the physical body doesnt matter anymore. we can hack and slash away at it and change it into anything we want  making girls into boys  men into antropomorphic animals  etc. but we barely understand the soul  the psyche  so we dont try to fix problems  we instead search for others who we percieve to have similar problems and surround ourselves with them. we dont fix problems  we find peers who tell us it is ok to have problems  its all natural and should be accepted.when one s actions no longer matter and only the opinion of the people around us does  we dont act to change ourselves or the world  we say we act  we make all the news we want to reflect our world view  without evidence and without proof.
emma d arcy is a case study in how wokeness poisons natural beauty.
being heterosexual is amazing! please refer to me as he him  thanks
no lies detected.
I know a kid  well  their parents  the kid had a speech in school about trans and all that  and they ofc  just said the bs woke people do say  the thing is  made the 10 years old kid want to change gender  parents said they wont let him go through with a operation  because he is too young to do so  and maight have remorse about it later  the thing is  the kid said it to the school  and now the parents are sued and maight lose their kid  I thing that is bad  a kid that is not 18  or 21 in some place  should never have the option to go ahead with changing gender in a permanent way. I also dont agree with the thing that people should call he she they etc to someone just because they want  if I see you and dont have tits I ll call you he  because thats what lenguage is for. what you feel you are  should never affect what others say or do  more even  when you literally go against something that is proven by science to be that way.
boom !
hey mel  I sent you a message on the gram
go a head and go boom beautiful lol me I dont care as long as no one trys to push this stuff on my kids.
Im great at playing a woman   says a woman.
in life you ll forever be criticized and get called out for doing and saying the right thing. all in all we should be like Jesus  walk by faith and not by sight.
gender fluid  has always been an amusing term.
attention seekers   the mentally ill  and groomers are the issue.
these clowns are paving the way to the days of noah and trying to create a new breed of nephilim.
wait  if she calls herself non binary  why does she use the pronoun I  shouldn t she doing a venom impression and using we
like ellen paige always playing a female char
ok bff  btw heterosexual means youre straight  it has nothing to do with gender  3 learn and gather info before commenting bby
appreciate your support towards my channel. 
you clearly do care
actors  want to make a really good show or movie  just shut up and act. believe it or not we dont care about your views  opinions or thoughts. make a good movie and keep your issues to yourself. same goes for these baseball players  basketball players  football players. we dont care.
it may interest you to know that the drugs used in puberty blocking were previously used to chemically castrate sex offenders. we know the effects they have  and we know how harmful they are.
I just dont understand the train of thought. I am a conservative Christian and would never tell them they are this or that for not believing what I believe its their choice. so dont tell me im a this or that for not believing what you want me to believe. I wont dont treat anyone a different way because of how they choose to identify just dont expect me to believe your a woman if your a man. its simple. we can still get along
those aren t pronouns. those are just regular nouns.
random point... Im surprised people with they them pronouns dont use we us when talking about themselve.
I am about ready to start raining on some parades. clearly nice is not working. reality is not an opinion.
what is that old adage. strong men create good times  good times create weak men  weak men create hard times  hard times create strong men. we re in the era of good times and everyone is so weak
oh nah  we ve gone into a world where common sense is not demonized. kinda like a dark ages 2.0  woke mob boogaloo  and we cant let ignorance and idiocy win
imagine the blow up they d have if a straight woman. said the same thing or took a role of a nb person
its become too ridiculous. Im done tolerating because now if I dont praise their insanity Im the problem.
the real bigots are the ones who use the word all the time.
at this point  the wokes are trolling us. that article title sounds like satire
why do people care  as long as she doesnt hurt anyone it doesnt matter
people really miss that transgender ideals are empowering gender rolesinstead of just saying yeah a boy can like dolls they say no because you like dolls you must be a girl.
there has to be some sort of nda put in place so that these actors stick to talking about the show and interviews have to do with the show. they have personql lives and thats okay. but  for example  any of us in normal jobs cant use our job accounts  emails and such as a platform to talk about our own crap. there should be something in place for them as well. otherwise  this insesant need to be the most ahead ever and progressive and special and unique... will ruin their show.thatsaid if she enjoys playing women  maybe thats telling her something she denies for the sake of hollywood points.and that picture is powerful. I went through a similar thing when I was a kid as well. I was very much a tomboy and a nerdy one at that. I am still a little bit of a tomboy  but far more connected to my femininity. I was told by other kids that I couldn t like video games or comics and such because it was a boy thing. thankfully  I had good parents and a good family. my mom and dad were instrumental in simply telling me that what I liked  did not make me a boy. I could like space  and scifI  and dislike pink  but like comics  video games  ttrpgs... my mom was instrumental on this since she loved star trek - still does - and she would go get comics with me when my dad was working and ask  and even read through them. she showed me  you can enjoy things that boys might enjoy as well  but not want to be a boy. community at church was also very powerful.I would be lost with another family in these modern times - the kind of families that keep their children non-binary until they can choose. the kind of parents that are led by their children instead of providing the guidance they need. puberty and teenage years are pretty brutal. children need guidance.
nonwhat  xd
fortunately  whether she identifies as a woman or a fire hydrant  she looks like a woman. this makes playing women much easier. imagine how much trouble she d have if she was hired to play a fire-breathing reptile because she identifies as a dragon.
her woman privilege showing there  good at playing women
female logic in 2022 what is a woman          a man.what is a man        evil patriarchy.
I do wonder what is causing such a increased   of people with the need to use pronouns and questioning their gender or species now. I have noticed myself I see a lot also have other mental health issues for difficulties or challenges. I see it a lot in people who are on the autism spectrum  who a   also suffer from mental health issues. I wonder
bruh.
where s the line
she looks like a girl to me!
but emma  what is a woman
transphobe will never be an insult to me tbh
emma  how dare you culturally appropriate binary women!
it is a real issue  but  woke culture  try to transform this circus of abomination into  freedom   love  etc.
I do wish that actors would just shut up and act
its all a fasade for recognition thats it.
she is non binary   I am going to enjoy watching her character get burned and eaten by a dragon.
I like playing  straight  women....thats what was really meant.....
if she goes by they them  isn t it grammatically incorrect to address herself as  i
my advice to to transgender  be very sure cause there is no undo what is going to be done.
you go melonie   remember what rheanyra said in the episode 8.  doesnt it matter  so dont give a damn about them and keep at and be strong..they are leaches and opportunistic
keep calling this insane shit out mm we will win the culture war!! we have to continue to speak out!!!
people hate the truth. youre just pointing out the emperor s new clothes and people want to play along while there rest of us are calling it as it is.... people are strange and easily offended.
men used to play women fine  in the olden days.
steven toussaint is good at playing black men...
totally agree let trans adult do what they want but leave the kids alone.
forget the backlash this shit is a joke they are literally living in a delusional world lol. who cares people get mad over anything anyway
no  because people dont generally use third person pronouns when talking about themselves in the first person
it took me one look at her instagram page and I knew it all  she s the whiny type  you know  the one s who dont have anything more interesting in their lives than being  queer  or  non binary .some people are just too privileged.
a joke is just a joke or we have to act like will smith  and the joke still fun also the tomboy turn out in a so pretty girl and sure you can performance  as a women despite you already are funny isnt it.
feminism clearly has nothing to do with defending or achieving womanhood.
yea its 100  gaslighting  these people cant really believe this nonsense  its insane.
those people are ridiculous and annoying. a woman playing a woman  wow how talented
people actually believe that there is no such thing as a woman
if you would have transitioned  we certainly would have lost a babe.
yo what s up with all the birthing scenes there s been three of them now there weren t any in the original game of thrones
the lesbiansnowwhite pisses me off as she legitsays the same thing everytime. its the exact same. that if she is a real supporter of neon pronouns   she s not helping that idea but legit looking insane because she says exact same thing every time
woman is good at playing a woman. well  there s something I never expected!
I agree wholeheartedly....she s good at playing woman  because ummm youre a woman. its only gonna get worse....humanity is doomed...all hope is lost lol.
Im agnostic. I dont want any one to change their religion to match mine  we dont need anyone on our bus. Imean no one any harm  but when I say that I dont get the  chosen pronoun  thing  I get dogged out. how am I the bad guy   so when I see a female actor that looks like a female  and has a feminine name say that they are non-binary and like playing female roles  my mind goes  who would cast you as a man   could you see emma d arcy play john rambo  not  joan  john rambo in a remake of first blood  the answer is no.
the dragon  dragons thing is gross
speak up!! also you need some really corny explosion when it it mel mac boom time!! yeah you can use it too!!  outrageous nonsense going today!!  also add these to yt shorts as I dont do tic tac. never back down!!
boom 5 5 baeed
well duh of couse she said that. u cant expect a gay character to act straight everytime eh  if she acting like a tomboy every single day it will hard for her to act  womanly
whahmens
itseems like simping is an overused term. being nice to a woman isn t simping unless you have ulterior motives or a servile attitude.
it is a joke. as soon as it becomes less of a fad for people in holywood suddenly they will say things youtubers are saying for years.
so we are expected to tolerate this kind of weirdo shitsilently......
not as insane as people getting upset at how complete strangers choose to live their lives
its odd  makes me question what their motive is. one thing I feel more certain of though is the incest garbage  I feel like the hollywood pervs are trying to normalize it
auto-subscriber here. the gender descriptios nowadays is making my head hurts.
my 1st time here and just happened upon your channel.  personally I think this culture was born out of professionals not having an answer or cure for gender dysphoria. everything psychologist tried in the past either made it worst or caused additional mental health problems. seems like a  cant fix itso normalize it  situation. sad but leave the kids out of it.
diversity in everything except ideas  the american way
part of me wonders if she was a diversity hire because she doesnt look anything like young rhaenyra while the other characters resemble their younger selves.
she took a role away from a female actor. isn t that how we are supposed to view this nowadays  I guess I dont know how it works.
you mean actress in your title.
wonder if any of these online  trans-activist  has ever met a true  genuine  transsexual person  the real ones  the ones suffering from sexual dysphoria . loved the joke  by the way.
a woman says she s really good playing as a woman
I dont agree thats they are  good at playing women . mostly with the word  good
movies show  they use the women woke and lgbtq way way too much the plot doesnt even play out bc all you see is that. nobody gives a fuck give us a movie with talented actors and a storyline the worst part is they ll use both lgbtq and the girl woke thingy on one character who exactly  the main character which is so shiiI and annoying asf.social media   let s really talk about this so you have little kids having devices everyone said  eh its ok so he she doesnt bother me they watch cartoon  now these same kids are now watching tiktok and have all of social media where lgbtq is out teaching these easy manipulated kids about this shiiI  tf same thing as school too
wtf is a turf    sorry Im normal I have no idea
based
Im really good at youtube comments  for a dude who identifies as a dude and has always been a dude and will probably always be a dude.I need recognition.
yepp emma is a woman  so yes she is good a t playing a woman! lol
emma is thechick disguised as a chick playing another chick. she will stay in character until the  end of the video commentary
this is f cke  up
geez maybe because... she is a woman!! shocking!!!
wokesters dont have a sense of humor  so their crits of your hilarious video are sort of like comments from a food critic who has no sense of taste. their criticisms mean nothing.
why does she even need to tell everyone she s non binary.  its  nothing special. she s good at playing a woman because she is one. idc if ppl say they are non binary but ppl are getting carried away with all this stuff. your an actress  your pronouns etc aren t important
get her off the show while they still have one.   new time skip go back to the other actresses please
emma was literally casted first
I wonder why a person who was born a woman is good at playing a woman in a tv show... shocking.that prison article made me giggle because its a massive oxymoron. trans woman knocks up 2 women in prison and is now in fear for her life... well  only men can get women pregnant so...
its almost like she s a woman...
this is so evident that you ve never talked to a trans person
shes good at playing a woman because shes a woman. what are we doing to ourselves
when an archeologist excavates their body in future they will examine it and say its either man or a woman  thats it nothing more to it
if youre gonna speak out  just be safe. carry some pepper spray and use the buddy system. people are tribal and things are dangerous right now.
Im okay being called an istaphobic bigot. doesnt bother me one bit.
ngl emma d arcy is a lot cuter on the show than in real life tbh
woman surprised she s good at playing women because she doesnt like being called a woman! news at 11.
this is all cheap controversy .given an undeserved wealth of attentions .I pray my children are never drawn into it.
I only know emma darcey from hotd. so only came across her recently. I thought this lesbian was really cool and attractive. I still love rhyannra. but Im disappointed to see emma falling for the gender idiology
so basically   woman who thinks she s not a woman is good at playing women characters ........
they them pronouns are just for people who want to be different because it makes them feel special. its literally the  I want attention but dont give it to me  type of people
anyone with self-proclaimed gender dysphoria should without question be treated as royalty.
Im a dude so Im not sure if youre wearing any or just very minimal makeup in this video. what I will say is Im sure you need no products bc you were born with it.
also in my very blue state I was stalked and harassed and called every slur in book in multiple workplaces and no one was ever reprimanded let alone fired. to pretend thats common is fear mongering.
Im sick of wokeism  it literally has destroyed cinema. Imiss the good ole days of film the michael mann  francis ford coppola  jerry bruckheimer days of hollywood.
its a mystery.......oh and I have zero irrational fear aka  phobia  of feminists and lgbt cultists  zero fear I do however despise all they stand for and advocate for and propagandize.
I feel like the entire trans comunitys anger is just redirected at society when they have individual cases of abuse or perpetration. this shitshouldnt be on tv itshould be in a terepy session. stop trying to rack your brain on it and be thankful you dont have any issues. but for the love of God keep pressing for the children. a normal life is possible for everyone.
everyone has an own story. you cant say generalities on one person or another because you didn t live the same experience. we are all different  let s accept this. now... ok she s physically a woman  so of course she can play women. I dont get it...  communication in fundamental.
I dont have any kids though .so..
is she pretty much saying she s doing drag. can a man play a woman now  or a woman a man
I agree with you but like you I am a man of God. but this stuff is getting way out of hand.
the other actor was a lot better.
I dont really care either way tbh but why they them pronouns  shit is confusing as hell.
knew there were something about this actress.
when did emma darcy target you and force you or anyone else to do anything
my pronoun is  literally hitler
she likes playing women  confuses me is she a woman or not  if she s not how can she have 3 children show its so confusion
non binary is just the new  Im bi!  for basic wht women. her acting is moderate at best and she uses her  queer  status to get picked over others for catchy headlines for the show. if she didn t say she was non binary she d be picked over for anyone else.
disgusting
you need to chill
I was enjoying the show. then this actress opens her mouth and I dont know if I want to watch any more of it
emma is good at playing a women because she is a women.
I really dislike hollyweird or hollywoke. when youtubers are more entertaining than the entertainers there was a wrong turn somewhere.
most children do not have gender dysphoria.
how can anyone be a feminist when no one knows what a woman is
how dare she plays a woman  Imean they  it  whatever
horsesenatorinromeera
she should try playing a man.... and see how convincing she is as a man
and now I hate emma darcy
more proof that you dont have to have a functioning brain to access the internet
the show is great  just ignore what the actors and showrunners say.
why
I gave up on house of the dragon...the new rhaenyra played by emma d arcy isn t as good as milly alcock. also  the new alicent is not as good as the original. facts.
why does your opinion have to be in a form of a joke though  youre already not taking itseriously. this doesnt really show your  genuine concerns.
I watched hod s1  I ll finish the finale. but I wont be back for s2 the characters are uninteresting
could be because she s a woman .
dragon pronouns     what the fuckkkk !!
females who play women should have some expert knowledge for the role. now playing a lady is not possible. you have to actually be a lady. not every woman is a lady.
how does transgenderism impede your religious freedoms
omg...this is so funny.  this gal doesnt realize she is a woman so yeah   she d be pretty good playing women on tv.  duh.  I d be pretty good playing a straight white dude myself although I identify as a large grey cat.
was kinda into house of the dragon until this last episode  soooo stupid
start backing up your content to rumble. the google axe is coming for all based content creators. even politically fringe creators like yourself wont be safe.
Im a guys guy    but Ive always loved strong women actresses   I loved lauren bacall   sigourney weaver  ripply  aliens  linda hamilton terminator  milla jovovich resident evil  kate beckinsale  underworld. I could go on and on. never once did I say to myself hey this is a female leading role  why isn t this character a guy  never. only in this woke times while they try to shove this feminist down my throat that I start to feel resentful  I didn t know anything about  emma  not one thing. first time I ever saw her was in house of dragons. now I find myself resenting her. she is an actress. just play your part in the show. nobody cared or cares  until now.
yall are jobless. they aren t. keep being pressed.
this chick is attractive
as a Christian  I respect God  not pronouns!God first served!
who cares  youre wasting so much time and energy on something that doesnt affect you or the children you seem so concerned with
I just dont have time for this stupidity any more. the only thing that comes from paying attention to a spoiled brat is more spoiled brat antics. call them stupid and walk away is about all I do any more.
so someone who identies as non-binary but really enjoys playing women   becaise she is a woman but she s also an attention seeker.
good Lord... a girl with tattoos who s not a feminist    and Im not seeing a ring ... kinda feel like asking for a date...
did you accept your old nose before you tried to change it
wait dont they say only gay people should play gay characters so what is a non binary playing a woman.  cancel that bigot
I already am synced to rumble and odysee
@melonie mac go boom  glad to hear it! make alternative platforms go boom
Im honored you think I got a nose job lol! same nose  I just grew into it. its still quite large haha! I have not had any cosmetic surgeries. got lip injections q few years ago and got them dissolved 3 years ago  I learned to just accept myself and Im happier for it
I want milly alcott as rhaenyra back! she didn t spout out such nonsense! just age her with make up  it will work. but now looking at d arcy s version of the princess....I just cant take this serious anymore. they seemed to tone down the wokeness for hotd for a while where as rop engaged the afterburner. but now  they are back in the race again.
I identify emma as my future wife
if gender is a social construct then why cant a gender fluid non-binary woman help me move a sleeper sofa into a fifth-floor walk-up
they them  is also an insult to those with multiple personalities  and also groups of people.
melonie please dont excuse yourself to the freaks  ever
just gonna leave this here. God created man and woman..... he doesnt make mistakes... society does
I agree. I hate dresses. I hate heels. I hate pink. that doesnt mean I was meant to be a boy instead
woman with womans parts good at playing women with womens parts. shocking.
anyone knows if emma darcy was born a woman  cause if thats the case I dont give a shit. if youre a biological female playing a female role it doesnt matter. non-binary isn t necessarily the same as transgender. its trying to be gender neutral out of your own choice  rediculous as that maybe
english should just adopt a gender-neutral pronoun thatso many other languages have. drop he she and replace it with something else. like  they  but singular.then one side cant be obnoxiously against trans people through using wrong pronouns  in the name of truth  and trans people cant make up some new bs pronouns. we just people.waiting for my world peace nobel prize  thankjuu
yet another ridiculous  hollywood  statement... this sjw movement is killing itself while I grab popcorns and enjoy the ride.
I really think millyallcock would have done just a good of job. no point in putting a lgbtqirl em d arcy. I will not submiyto her he she they them iz oz zI zo thing.
already disliking  and yes  not even gonna finish this video before commenting  because the thumbnail and title of this video kinda tell me you have not a real clue what your talking about and what a non bianary person could possibly meana when they say something like this....wonder why you ve been called a transphobe before.... gaslighting our common sense  sounds exactly like what that type of person would say.
non binary actor hahaha what a stupid term
its pretty hilarious to watch the gay movement going to die on the trans hill topic.the harder they try to defend that thing the worse their whole movement looks.
you went from a semi-respected video creator to screeching about generic right-wing talking points on a dying youtube channel and begging the quartering for attention. its clear at this point youre just desperately churning out garbage content in the hope that you ll be picked up for the daily wire.
Christians  just make trans people read deuteronomy 22 5
you are good at playing women  yeah  like all of them  because they are all the same and have no individuality or uniqueness
its shit like this that makes me not want to watch house of dragons...
do you mean a homaphrodite
maybe this will help you out  gender  and  sex  are not synonymous. sex  is binary. yep  there are some intersex people and a few other very rare edge cases where that binary boundary gets blurred. all of that is very rare  and still binary but just with re-combinations of those binary sexes. gender  is not binary. its not even a real thing  by which Imean  its not related to any physical part of your body. gender is not tied to genitals or reproductive ability or any other sexual characteristic or any other physical part of our bodies. its a social construct. everybody identifies as some kind of gender. most people seem to identify with a gender than matches their sex. some dont.some who dont  learn to live with it.some who dont  seek to change the thing they can change. changing their identity is very difficult  nearly impossible  and often results in a very unhappy person. sometimes tragically unhappy.its actually much easier to change the sexual characteristics  at least outwardly  so their body more closely matches their identity. is it weird to have a gender identity of a  dragon  or a  gamer  or whatever  yeah  probably. Im on board with the idea thatsome things are randomly getting lobbed into  gender identity  when they are really parts of a person s identity completely separate from that person s gender. straight  gay  bI  trans  etc.  are gender identities. there are many more.dragon or gamer are mostly hobby identities  or fantasy identities. these people might be straight dragons or gay gamers or trans  or whatever  but the gamer or dragon part of their identity is probably not part of their gender. but  maybe for some  it is. if a person identifies as a gamer and is only attracted to other gamers  well  maybe that might be related to their gender.I ll leave that to trained medical professionals to figure out.but I do feel like many people just throw out this goofy stuff so they can look cool to their friends. Im far from saying that is what is always happening  but its probably happening sometimes. and  at least in my estimation  itseems like the strangest identities are more likely to be trolling  or seriously in need of therapy  but maybe not all of them. who am I to judge
do you even listen to yourself  one of your points was that it is important to you that people dont see you as less of a woman because you grew up being very tomboy-ish but then you go ahead and affirm other people s gender by pointing out how they  live as a woman as much as they can   referring to feminine clothing  etc. do you see the issue here  I dont think you understand the concept of the binary gender boundaries western society has and how people push those boundaries differently. gender is literally something we were raised with  not born with. there is no biological evidence for a binary gender system  obviously there are differences  but nothing that can be put in a binary . it is literally made up. so challenging that and questioning that is more than valid. gender has always been used as an oppressive tool. people may feel at odds with their gender for a variety of reasons and it is their business how they want to express and affirm their gender. it has nothing to do with you  why are you so upset about it  your life is not any harder because of it. maybe educate yourself a bit in the realm of sociocultural anthropology and research about gender specifically  you might be shocked to learn that gender is a lot more complex and always has been and is way more nuanced than the  gender binary  of male female.
I thumbs down  anyone who uses the nonlanguage that has been wrought on all of us like calling people non-binary its not even a word at all  thats not how words work!  or trans.if you say  trans people  as an actual category of human  you ought be ignored for the rest of your life.
I think only gays will understand...but her quote makes her looks cooler ...its a harmless statement
we need to get this pc and woke crap out of entertainment and the americans fixation on this stuff is ruining societies around the world
get the heck out of here with that non binary crap! what does that even mean
do even read the article though  it was a response to context given by the interviewer. not even a blatant declaration out of nowhere. you spun the title too far I think.
.....anyway. boring. you made no points thatspark any real concern  you have no reason to care so much. youreally went  boom  on this topic. I hope every overweight right-wing religious  sigma  gamer picked you  dude  I really do. and  just because you deserve an insult  you have an incredibly shrill and grating voice  please stop talking. forever.
respectfully  the more you do these types of videos  melanie mac go bye bye
remember back when playing video games used to be a typical boy activity  does that mean the old saying  there s no girls on the internet  got taken a little too serious and girls started being trans to play video games
well said little wise queen ..this comes out of a muslim mouth and I wish you would be a muslim sister of mine
dont explain yourself  youre entitled to your opinion.  stop giving them a position of power by  explaining yourself
Im totes not a femenist  lol trying to appeal to mostly male audience are we  pickmes gotta pay the bills somehow.
why do you people act as if emma d arcy or any other non binary person personally slid into your dms talking about which pronouns they want you to use
I respectfully agree to disagree with you. some things cross the line for sure  not they them pronouns tho-the weird neo pronouns are totally not it.
this show is dropping fast. I find myself dozing off half the time. they lost their best actor  this comment from the new one is just stupid  daemon just creeps me out.  the rest of the characters are just boring.  to prove my point  name one character you love and are really rooting for
thanks for calling the actress out. she s not as good as the previous actress and itshows.
I hope they leave their non binary crap out of the show. the show is decent and them trying to give an award for their actors being gay and non whatever is straight up stupid. they need to focus on the show and thats it. yes the actors they chose are great. but when I go to work  ya know what they tell me   dont bring your social life to work. no ocne cares if your gay   straight  and non whatever. your their to work and to get praised for your work. not for your gender.
I wonder if the fact thatshe is a woman helped her get the role of a woman...
my pronouns are ultra dark maga. this emma woman looks miserable. my wife s nephew is trans and she is beautiful like blaire white. I am not into tattoo s but that is me. our other niece was a tomboy at age 12. she is a beautiful 18yo woman now.
because as a biological woman it doesnt matter what I wear or how I style myself  I will always be a woman and people wont doubt it. if a biological man is gonna call himself a woman then he should actually try living like one and put forth the effort  its too unsafe for them to be in female spaces if we just open the door for all men to waltz in just because he says he identifies as femaleif a man wants to be treated like a woman then he needs to try  point blank. you cant just call yourself the opposite gender and expect the world to play along if you aren t actually living as such
@potatoswillrise thebigopotato  yes! she is completely misinformed on all of the topics she talks about in this  its crazy!
@azraiel 1984  believe me  I wont be. just dont be surprised if this come back to bite
I like the big dragon
you dont have to root for any character to love their character. Im not rooting for anyone  they re all bad people but its the drama and the plot people are in for. personally  right now Im really digging aemond s character the most and I cant wait to see what they do with him.
viserys  dude kept the realm at peace for almost 3 decades lmao
they the  is just self-aggrandised posturing. my daughter  17  currently calling herself ethan  has a girl friend who goes by they them. said girl still dresses like a girl  acts like a girl  responds to the same name  for all intents and purposes is a girl  but insists on being called they them.its nothing but self-aggrandised posturing.its so fucking stupid and egotistical and aggravating.
puberty blockers do not mutilate children and are 100  reversible. it is not a  crisis  when the teeny tiny amount of children who do go on puberty blockers has an even smaller amount of patients that regret fully transitioning through their teens and into adulthood  infact it makes their quality of life better. another thing is that just because you used to be a tomboy but  grew out of it   doesnt mean every single person on earth experiences things like you do. some people do not fully fit into either role of man or woman  why is itsuch a big deal to you what someone else feels about their body and identity  I live in one of the safest  most accepting place for lgbtq people and I have never ever experienced or met a single person who has experienced this fairytale situation on some big hairy man walking into a womens bathroom  you care way too much about other peoples genitals and to bring religion into it as if itshould give you a right to verbally degrade trans people. you aren t a terf  as the only thing in that word is accurate is the  trans exclusionary   just your typical transphobe
the actress who played young alicent uses   they   pronoums........flame me if you want  but this pronouns obsession is getting out of control.
leave them alone  ffs. they re not hurting you.
omg and you are talking like a man!! your opinions are so biased  as if gender was a firm solid rock that no one can move from. like are youreally saying that your problem is not being comfortable in the toilet  I feel disgusted by your opinions
sorry... who tf mutilated their own child  the percentage of parents that would approva that is very fucking low  dont act as if now being trans is normalized and intrinsic in our society because it is not. people are still widely discriminated  and usually by parents first hand! I understand your opinions  I think we should be 18 before making choices like this. however  the narrative you are spreading is non realistic!! and you go making jokes about emma d arcy and her identity   hello
unsubscribing for calling a man a woman and disrespecting reality. peace
leave her alone  ffs.  she s not hurting you......ftfy
@ezio auditore  they re not hurting you by using they their pronouns either. what is it to you
@mj norman  its an assault on reality  logic and common sense....a modern version of 2 2 5 which I expect you dont know is in reference to
@ezio auditore  its an assault on nothing. its a person s feeling regarding themselves.
@mj norman  Im so shocked that you cant see the bigger picture
@ezio auditore  there isn t a bigger picture. they aren t hurting you with how they feel about themselves. leave them alone. get on with your own life.
just a staggering amount of parents who want to belong looking for attention at the expense of their children.
grow up kid.
