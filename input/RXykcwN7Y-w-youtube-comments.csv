blade needs to be rated r with a combination of horror and action with an atmosphere like  underworld . on a side note kate beckinsale as selene from  underworld  is one of my favorite female leads.
oh man  I need to see this script. for marvel to do a rewrite because something was  woke in a disrespectful way  must mean it was really something else.
writing these days is terrible.   pretty much sums up why I only watch old movies these days.
there is just no way that the current disney writers could hope to make a better movie than the original blade or underworld movies. and Im sure we re all just shocked that disney would try to upstage blade with his daughter  no  no  I guess nobody is surprised at all.
I wouldn t count on any good movies coming from marvel for quite a while  the original blade was such a fun movie
Ive never watched the blade movies  not a big vampire fan   but doing this kind of thing to his character horrifies me. the few clips Ive seen of the first movie and the very little Ive seen of him in comics have given me the impression of cool  strong  badass of a character. to remake him   and not have him look like wesley snipes   would be jarring enough. to make him second fiddle to some mary sue character  ugh. blade deserves better and I hope he gets it.
w0ke writer a   oh shyte  we have to come up with a story for blade! w0ke writer b   uhm... how about we copy and paste the first underworld movie  but make itsuperw0ke  w0ke writer a   but what if someone notices  w0ke writer b   pfft  we are too clever for that! w0ke writer a   oh my God  you are such a strong independent woman! w0ke writer b   yep  that gender studies degree finally pays off...
rest in peace to kevin conroy...
I remember whenever there used to be a big writer s strike  tv shows and movies would suffer and often die out because all the good writers refused to work with them out of solidarity.the shitty writing we got during those times was still far far better than the crap disney and friends are feeding us now.
some motherfuckers are always trying to ice-skate uphill. -blade  1998
you d think if they wanted to copy a successful vampire movie they would have chosen blade
to quote wesley snipe s blade  after he clearly broke character   are you outta ya mind !
thank you to all verteran  and thank your father and brothers for their service melonie. we definitely dont seem to be gettng top quality shows and movies like we used too. Im right there with ya melonie. I usually love these types of movies. and I loved underworld. this is very interesting. great video melonie. enjoy your day. give your dad and brothers a hug from us. and take care melonie.
yeah  I dont have high hopes for any marvel movie at this point. loving and thunder was just proof that multiverse of madness wasn t a one off  and wakanda forever has certainly carried on the trend. I expect the blade movie will be morbius 2.0
how long it will take for them to understand  that people rather watch a good story  with no woke vs woke with a bad story.
I just rewatched the blade trilogy last week. good fun movies. imagine if blade 1 came out now with snipes etc. would be pretty cool
while this thought doesnt directly apply -- you spoke of the quality of the writers.  tonight my wife and I watched  a knight s tale  2001   -- its silly and fun and quite easy to watch multiple times.   this story has strong men  strong women  dedication and loyalty  action in defeat and action in success  and even a bit of silly romance.  why cant hollywood writers create material like this today   is it because productions which are fun and entertaining are no longer the objectives   I think we re finished with the theatres and will stick with old movies.
mel mel we already knew the blade movie was going to be re-written when mahershal al was getting frustrated . I am not surprised they wanted to use the  blade  name but make it like another movie. surprised they re not doing a  re-imagining  where blade is really knife and a hispanic woman who s a full vampire who had an abusive father.all these movies  shows  from marvel  have had terrible writers and people who make thinks for there friends. they got these degrees in activism and think they know what people want to here without being around actual people outside there friend group.this man has a daughter and she becomes a God   bruh this is trashhhhhhhhh. blade being sidelined in his own movie. like why
kate beckinsale was pushing for an actual blade underworld crossover around 2015. marvel was  approached in the belief that blade wasn t a character that would get used in the mcu but they passed on the deal.this came up in a q a with kate at the 2016 new york comI con.
I liked the first underworld as well. that movie was a very pleasant surprise  particularly that twist with victor and the whole conspiracy theory with the vampire ans lycan war. and michael corvin was awesome in the first two movies.assuming rumors are true  copying underworld on top of being woke is way too funny  and they re doing it with blade of all characters. there is no need to include werewolves  no need for hybrids  and definitely no need for another bait and switch. also  based on spoilers Ive heard  I definitely do not intend to spend my time watching wakanda forever  not after learning what they did to t challa  not after replacing namor with  nah-mor  and they did to him and his army of blue people  not after including rirI williams  and basically not after destroying the legacy and goodwill that the first movie built.
she did a great job for a number of complelling reasons.
lies there has never been a strong female lead  ever  in cinema before current year.
blade needs to be blade. not an underworld clone. the og blade was perfectly fine. snipes was perfect and it had that dark atmosphere despite the cheesy 90s effects.
hollywoke takings modern feminist stand on demasculating men and using a check box system to destroy entertainment! the brainwashing and grooming continues
or like the blade trilogy!underworld copied him!
@david ash reynoso  what s with selene  strong female!
it might be my enthusiasm about werewolf by night being actually good  but I think something on that vein could be interesting to watch.
meh  the flicks were basically mindless action for the most part. dont inflate underworld for more than it actually was.
I love underworld except for the last movie so-called killing off michael was garbage. I was hoping that if they did another movie once they gave him blood he would revive
and without kate as the lead role underworld is not interesting to me anymore. she was the best. a kind of ripley material  so good she was. and I will never watch a blade movie without wesley snipes as blade  you can simply forget it.
it was likely misandrist against black men
there was no script  there s pages every time they shoot something.
Im confused
@raw  more likely the other way around  blade probably was a racist black power dude where even marvel said  yo hold up  now thats a lil too far
@lp.shakur  watch wakanda forever
@raw  just to add on here  there were no heroes in wakanda forever.everyone in that movie killed 10-30 people  out of anger  showing little to no remorse. the new scientist chick who apparently has her own show coming killed a bunch of cops for being in their way and blocking a bridge.none of the characters were relatable.
@lp.shakur  nope
@lp.shakur  I really think that they probably just made him a side character in his own story. the mary sue daughter character they created wouldn t have allow him to be the kind of character you described  it would have taken the attention off of her   how awesome and strong and so much better than blade she is in every possible way. I think they probably just demeaned him most of the movie. or it might be the fact that they apparently ripped off the script from another me   not bring sarcastic  Ive not watched either franchise  although I respect wesley snipes  blade people would be most mad I think if blade were reduced to a pathetic shadow of a man. and the way female characters  esp in franchises owned by disney  are written now  super-special vampire mary sue would not only be better than blade by virtue of not having a y chromosome  but while she showed him up the entire movie  she would also castigate him for imagined toxic behaviors or micro-aggressions. and beta blade would be like  omigosh  youre right! Im no longer tough and incredibly resilient  micro-aggressions are now the most horrible thing I can imagine in my half-vampire vampire-hunting life. Im so happy youre here to school your old man  super-special vampire mary sue! I didn t realize how toxic I had become. I ll just take a back-seat and be awed by your awesomeness unless I need to be rescued by you or otherwise used to elevate you in this movie. this is your movie  baby girl  thank you for letting me a part of it. I think it would be that blade that would be too woke for the woke.
this script and the original script for she-hulk before it got re-written need to come out  so we can cement their place in the annals of failure. Ive heard they both were absolute dumpster fires but still have a morbid curiosity to see them.
thats only because she s gorgeous.
@hiraghm  nah  she s way too skinny. no chest  no hips.
it also needs to be about blade   not waaahhman!!
for me she is the only female iead I liked  if I think about it.
underworld was awesome
I dont get it  blade and underworld are pretty similar in tone and style. do people really think there s a difference
I was 23 when that movie came out because I fell in love with the trailer. it just looked amazing and I had to see it opening day. to this day  the only ones I ever saw in theater were the first three movies and I own all of them. the fourth lost my interest when I heard thatscott speedman wasn t in it nor was he returning to the franchise. it was a real shame but a good one as the writers seemed to lose the plot with his exit and kate beckinsale s character was taken in directions that didn t make sense to me.
agreed
@delphine lavender morgan  u missed the point of his joke... he s saying holywoke never acknowledged the existence of female leads... ever
just the way seline comes off the rooftop in the beginning and does a damn near fully straight legged landing instead of the  superhero landing...  I never thought of it before  but that conveys a real strength and confident woman  as well as being inexplicably sexy.
the underworld films  even if not all of them are that good xd  are in my favorite rewatch list and half of the reason is just selene  the other half is I love vampires werewolfs. and yeah  if they make blade a woke shit movie  I will totally hate them for ever and never pay for any disney movie ever again.
@jimairborne25  the way she hit the ground already walking was dope!
no. it needs to be like the first blade movies. dolt
I duly concur. and yes  she definitely fit the role perfectly.
@tristan dizzo  was it not a good movie to put a token black people everywhere  you even got not one but 2 token black female geniuses and all the inclusivity that we heard said multiple times in all the interviews with actors.
@samuraI nelson  hI  Im the same poster whose comment youresponded to about blade being sidelined in his own franchise. my ability to post from my other account has been frozen and Im waiting for youtube to fix it.I agree that the issue is the agenda pushing the star of a franchise out of his own franchise or somehow denigrating him to elevate another brand-new super-perfect character..when I see movies  I want to enjoy the main character in his rightful place in his franchise   whether that be iron man  wonder woman  daredevil  or  in this case  blade. blade  just like any of the other characters Imentioned  deserves the right to be represented on screen as he always has been in comics. I know that when I first saw him in a fairly recent defenders comic  I got a thrill when he showed up for a brief cameo. that is the kind of presence blade has  even for someone s knowledge of blade s lore comes from sites about comic book characters.  yes  Im the person who reads about characters in marvel and dc s comic book databases that thrill is what blade should be allowed to give audiences in this movie as much as he did in previous ones. he s got some awesome story lines in his comic lore. those stories should be told or built upon! a watered down  denigrated  significantly altered blade would be worse than not seeing him on screen again at all. Ive gotten to the point where I d prefer not to see my favorite characters  franchises on screen. I d rather not see them humiliated  sidelined  neutered  or otherwise made substantially unrecognizable to longtime fans. blade  and other franchise-leading characters  deserve better.
@nate nightingale  me too! I want cringe fest like the time simeone leaked the cw powerpuffgirl live action
@perry 714  not sure  but let s hope it can be fixed by going bankrupt  they are well on their way.
yup  I only watch old films and stuff from asia. you the proper mindset man
song of the south  birth of a nation  white dog  gone with the wind
yeah me too. or heavily select movies. like I watched uncharted and sure  its a fun movie if you see it as something on its own  not connected to the game.... but it doesnt even remotely come close to classics like indiana jones  the mummy  national treasure. the last film show that really got me enthusiastic was the haunting of hill house  that really has a fantastic story and isn t playing the woke games  it has hints of it here and there  coz there is some diversity and 1 character is lesbian  but fits into the plot. its not wokeness for the sake of checkboxes. but pretty much haven t seen anything after that  which remotely caught my interest.... and that was what  2016
pfft...that clich  has been clich d. he s a twin and sister is megan thee stallion.
seems like the usual biz with disney. nothing new here.
the current disney writers couldn t make a better movie than my 12 year old son.
I could...... and I could do so easily.
this just in  matilda- the musical has just toppled wakanda forever at the uk box office.rofl  it just doesnt get better than this. a freaking musical beats an mcu film
hell  all 3 were. people cantalk shit about trinity all they want  it was still a fun movie that had its moments of greatness. I dont think anything could beat blade 2  but Im glad we have all 3. I dont need any more  ever again. quality is always better than quantity. wesley snipes is blade  nobody else  not now  and not ever.
yeah  exactly. the whole trilogy is better than anything disney marvel is putting out. I especially like that one scene where blade calls out ryan reynolds character for seeming to take everything as a joke.
my biggest issue with original blade. 2   3 should ve been two part movies.I like them both. but  both movies were sold short . to fit a single movie.
@ermac jones  I didn t like blade trinity as much as the others  but the care bear joke was hilarious. ryan reynolds always delivers the goods.
@kaoticorder  he really does lol he can make anything at least watchable
I loved the blade movies. excited about new ones  but I just hope they will not be part of any super hero universe. please just keep it its own thing. and dont change too much about the blade character  almost hard to imagine someone else than ws in the role to be honest.
@ermac jones  facts
blade movies were great
they should just  not be touched in my opinion. at least for a couple more years. the wesley snipes movies were just  good. we dont need to touch that.
@dean firnatine   I love the first two. the third one with ryan reynolds  wasn t so hot though.
blade 2 is more of a monster movie than a vampire movie  you might like that one. also  it was directed by guillermo del toro and was an awesome film.
@john smith  how intense is it  I used to love action movies  but since my chronic illnesses let me know they are there  I end up feeling very unwell from even movies and shows I love. Ive even had a reaction when finishing  avatar  the last airbender . if there s not a lot of jump scares  though  and I spoil the plot for myself ahead of time  Imight be able to enjoy the 2nd blade without too much of an issue. is wesley snipes still blade  for some reason I thought they replaced him in  one of   the sequel s
@tahlia nerds out  wesley snipes is still blade. there are a few jump scares and horror elements in it  but the horror elements are much more body horror than jump scares. its a pretty simple plot too  back when comic book movies didn t have to build to the next comic book movie and could just be fun self-contained stories. I d check out some clips  maybe watch with a friend but its not crazy crazy intense.
they also made a blade series  2006   only 12  pisodes were made but it wasn t bad at all  given the time and budget.especially compared to the modern series nowadays that are total crap and last longer than two seasons...
@captsnes  its entertainingly bad and I love that dumpster fire.
wesley snipes did own that role and made better that he is an actual martial artist. the new actor has a good look and is very passable as blade and I do think he can pull it off. only thing is I dont know how he look in fight scenes.
sad  because its true.
if any version is gonna be woke its their one.
batman is now truly dead.
@otterloopbI didn t believe you until I looked it up. now both of my heroes kevin conroy and adam west are dead. Im a sad batman fan right now.
nooooooooooooooooooooo! i... have no words...
pain
didn t even know that.  terrible to hear that.
@john durham yeah  they should just lock up the rights to the character and never use any of the batman characters ever again.
@geeebuttersnap  I like the classic characters  thats why I have no interest in the new batman movie. you might be joking but I would fully support that. anything s better than serial killer riddler.
@demonicremption  bruh.just watched a harley quinn     episode with dietrich bader as bats.now I know.
@the jakker  you found out about conroy s passing two days ago...  awe man...
truth.
give the fans half the budget and we will give you a blockbuster.
such a great moment though  always loved that reaction to getting shot.
@broken fingers  same!! haha and the fact that they bothered to shoot him  and not the burnt vampire made it even more hilarious.  d
thatscene always makes me laugh.
thatscene is hilarious
morbin  is ballin ! - marvel
you never go full morb
what does that mean  what if someone likes 1 doesnt like another and hasn t seen another to know  what is the trend  and how have you watched black panther faster than fans of the series if you dislike itso much
does this mean you still payed to watch them  I sure hope not.
@usada pekora  paid to watch them  no  forced to watch as part of my new  career .
morbius was a horrible movie.
@akujobI kelechi  sacrilege!!!
that would be giving this a lot more credit... while it wasn t good morbius was.... well I enjoyed it for the wrong reasons. it was kind of like surf ninja s something so bad it has wrapped around to at least be memorable. it was the good kind of shlock.and wakanda forever that first 10 or so minutes dealing and respecting chadwich was maybe the best part of it. it was a smart start fueled by the actors to respect a friend and didn t try and tear him down to make sshurI the best. my opinion but after that there waas still 2 hours of drag.
problem is one can no longer assume the movie industry is about entertainment  when modern industry is all about agenda wrapped in a thin veneer masquerading as entertainment.
yeah. but I dont like to go by doomcock though. according to him kathleen kennedy is fired every other week and 3 times in between. personally I think that guy just sits a lot on reddit and the anonymous sources are actually reddit leaks  which proven accurate more or less cause they are probably disgruntled employees shaking their heads at the garbage he she has to do during the daytime while knowing its gonna be a huge flop coz they know what actually goes on outside the hollywood bubble and vents it out on reddit coz he cant complain at work w o getting fired.
its because they prioritise activism rather than a good story and characters.
productions still put out good products. and have always put out bad ones.
@ifstatement ifstatement  exactly  its the activist sensibilities that get in the way of doing stories and characters for the sake of traditional entertainment since in these people s minds western tradition is a forsaken  social construct.
its a safe bet the writer was trying to adapt their vampire  the masquerade character that the storyteller refused to allow.
I cant imagine  modern sensibilities  disney marvel being remotely capable of creating something of worth. I love underworld  one of my favorite popcorn movies  but blade shouldn t be underworld. just as lara croft shouldn t be a damsel in distress.
blade is such a cool character! long live the midnight sons!
underworld  rise of the lycans is one of my all time favs that lucian story is fire. I hope blade is good but nowadays I expect everything to suck.
it was also reported that the blade director quit because mahershala alI hated the script  and hated the director s suggestions on fixing it  and threatened to leave the project unless it was re-written. so at this point  who knows what s really going on with it. hopefully they can make a script good enough to keep him attached because he s basically the main reason people will go to see it.
original underworld movie is criminally underrated. love it!
I love underworld! you have a strong female character thats well written  well acted  and very likeable.witchcraft!!!!!
yup  saw that bad news on another channel last week. no wonder why the movie director left the project  completely pissed off.edit   yes  thats doomcock.
blade called a vampire by the wrong pronoun and got shunned by the vampire council
remember this whole thing started with the blade movies... and now... so many years later it feels we have come full circle.
great vod  mel and cute top by the way  you look amazing! it makes absolutely no sense why they wanted blade to be like underworld  underworld is a great movie by the way  and writers seriously need to stop putting woke crap in our entertainment as well as need to stop transforming our fav franchises into something they are not.
I love blade as a kid Imean he s got such a wonderful background. you find out later he s actually hundreds of years old and was passing as a street kid because he didn t want van helsing to shish kabob him. you find out that he s a deeply laid character..I love everything about blade one of the key factors was he has a great deal of anger for God. it might be contradictory but the fact of the matter is he might have faith God exists but he s not faithful to God because he was born without a soul. was born a vampire with no soul.. that is f     deep so of course woke disney decided he s going to be a devout muslim..
thank you for mentioning veteran s day.
I loved all the underworld movies  even the later  more weird ones where selene gets some type of superpowers. good vamp vs wolf action flicks.
Ive never seen underworld but from what you ve described from your experience seeing the movie and comparing it to the blade script it just sounds like marvel is running out of ideas at this point when it comes to their movies and live action shows with werewolf by night being the last good thing as of late. the only marvel thing that I am interested thats coming up is their new cartoon devI dinosaur and moon girl which comes out on february 10th and the reason why Im excited for it is because its something different from their usual animated series that they have been doing and it appears to also have some anime influences from the character s expressions in the preview that was shown off last month at nycc.
one thing I notice is that production budgets are no longer being revealed by the studios. they know these movies are bombing and are trying to hide it. at no point in history were budgets ever a secret except the last few years.
I do love the underworld movies. I dvred all five showings in a row last month in the order they came out. kate beckinsale s a real badass!
blade  the mostly peaceful vampire  allegedly  - coming fall 2023! from marvel!
thank you for reminding me of underworld. such a great movie.
still find it odd from a company that brought you mickey mouse and princess stories  hearing disney s blade.
who
yeah  underworld is a great popcorn flick.
beware of impersonators and scammers
they already introduced elsa bloodstone in werewolf by night. they could do a movie about her but no let s just do this instead.
if anyone thinks marvel cant be too woke I have three words   by odin s fade
totally agree  loved underworld!
further reason as to why I spend so many movie watching stints on weekends watching old movies that I haven t seen in a while  but very grateful the interwebs are starting to stream them. youreally shouldn t mess with a classic  because its a classic.
stacey abrahams is free to play blade now.
amen. you are so right on about hollywood s  netflix  amazon  marvel  and disney s woke agenda will make them all go broke. gay and weak is the new black and the value of a real man and a real woman are total inconsequential to the woke crowd. it is sick and annoying.
when I said an underworld blade crossover could be fun  this isn t what Imeant!
I  among countless others  been waiting for another blade movie for a long time. the same can be said for another spawn installation. sequel  reboot  ... make. whatever. either movie will suffice as long as its done right. stunts. explosions. gunfights. blood. ashes. fashion. techno music      _   _
kudos. eric brooks aka blade is a dhampir  half human half vampire. the daughter would be only be a quarter vampire and three quarters human  presume the mother is human . kind of get why the powers may be suppressed initially  but never in any multiverse would she be more powerful than blade. in underworld scott speedman played michael corvin  the descendant of the immortal alexander corvinus  alexander the great . alexander had three sons  immortal twins marcus and william and a third mortal son. marcus bitten by a bat became the first vampire and william bitten by a wolf became the first lycan. the third son  carried the dormant immortality gene that was disseminate to all his descendants  this particular gene allowed michael to be bitten by both lycan and vampire  to become a formidable hybrid creature.
my mate recently asked me if I wanted to go cinema to watch bpf and I said to him  I haven t been interested in watching anything marvel for a long time after endgame . blade was the one character for me to feel! anything positive toward this phrase 4 and thats 100  based off nostalgia for wesley s movies then years later buying the graphics after learning he has history. now finding out what they were thinking of doing to him  making him ride bitch in his own movie is a fucked up move. this like so many other forms of media that were well received by fans two decades ago are done!.
what would you chose to have  if you could have only one superpower  Ive always been intrigued by invisibility.
yes. Im glad Im not the only one who adores the first  and only the first  underworld.
Goddammit! of course they would messed with one of the best vampire hunter in comics!damn hell!
blade is a legend and continuing its storyline and respecting its legacy will please fan and their support will be ensured. now its in trouble because of writer malfunction
well Imean underworld is pretty much a rip-off of vampire  the masquerade  werewolf  the apocalypse  and the world of darkness. so much so thatsony settled out of court to avoid the issue. I did like underworld tho.honestly  I really really wonder if the only thing that has changed at marvel is that the awesomeness that was stan lee is no longer there to tell them when they have bad ideas. I know he was not majorly involved with the movies and had executive producer credits on them but it just seems like things got so bad since he died. also  rip kevin conroy always the best batman ever.
good to see they are rewriting something like this  hopefully to something better and not worse. I dropped the mcu stuff after she hulk  didn t even finish the show.  did not find it fun watching something that was written so clearly hating on fans and men in general  just dont think they need to tear down men in order to make good female characters  but  agendas  will do that. to be honest I started to tune out in ms. marvel as well considering thatshow felt like a bad disney morning sitcom type show  Imean the villains were okay one second then in a rush the next and had a hard time catching a high schooler yet killed a supposedly highly trained assassin. only thing good I felt like watching in it was the family dichotomy and historical stuff. my wallet will likely be closed to marvel for a while now  at least till they stop all the woke agenda pushing. thanks for the heads up and video melonie!
all they need to do is make a strong protagonist who is a masculine male character  who is badass slayer.  you add strong supporting characters  including strong feminine characters who are shown to be strong through supporting evidence of their actions in the movie. character development  call to action  heroes journey  good plot line  good scene pacing  well placed action sequences  emotional scenes that are earned through the pacing and character development and interactions the protagonist has with the supporting cast. its really thatsimple. finish out strong with boss fight  sacrifice  shock ending  or resolution to the main plot and establish a new normal post heroes journey ensure people feel something at the end.
I loved underworld.
so let me understand this melonie your favorite movie of all time is a movie about supernatural creatures with supernatural powers  heightened strength speed and healing  that use guns to kill each other instead of their supernatural powers
Im still planning on seeing it.  thats why nothing will change.
they just revel in destruction of the stan lee era marvel and anything that remotely related to him. bunch of rotters.
as an empath  I sense  sarcasm
I love bloodstone she dope af
abrams is already scheduled to play the lead in tubby the buffett slayer
way too complex for these writers
agreed.
if you are so willing to see it  watch online by  the usual suspects  sites.
melonknee is pretty good at predictions especially the woke weather
someone has to go to disney and say   you gotta do better  senator!  and if they refuse you should say   there is a tempest in me!
they ever did make a blade movie I wonder who could play the role wesley snipes will always be blade
its funny that underworld is your favorite movie  because you actually reminded me of beckinsale... except a bit more petite  maybe. and an entirely different accent  of course.
great take and recognition of veterans day!
even in  endgame   you had that  girl power  moment where all of the heroes that were near peter and the gauntlet to deliver it to the van  just happened to be all women.  that the only people capable of guarding the gauntlet and safely delivering it were women.there s shades of the original blade story in this supposed version.  blade s daughter is  intelligence  for his ops  like abigail was  as well as being an operative to whistler.
loved the first underworld too
there s always some mtf trying to ice skate up hill  wesley snipes as blade
sad thing is  I d actually love to see another werewolf  vampire hybrid in pop culture  given underworld is gone and no ones using the concept. but if you wanna have blade pass on the title to his op child  at least have it be a son.
one of the writers was a writer for watchmen.... so we can have a pretty good idea of what we would have gotten.
on what I read about it and seen  it looked like a remake of the first blade movie. even had a recasted frost  whisper etc.
you missed the part where they said that blade s daughter was going to replace him  which is so on brand for disney marvel now.
disney marvel is trying to get doomcock banned because he s been calling them out for shitshows. they even took a cheap shot at him in she-hulk
interested fact about underworld. previous action movies they put sunglasses on the stars because their eyes fliched when they fired weapons. kate beckinsale did not. and it was still not a mainstream selling point of the movie. totally undersold that point.
michael corvin was speedman s character in underworld.
keep up the great work on your channel  keep hustling
any other plot would have been a miracle.
Im a yuuuuuuuuuge fan of the first underworld .
they can have blade  man-thing and werewolf by night as a backup.  but  he should have a movie on his own and make it nice and gory.  but  they will try to introduce a female blade.
when I first heard they were trying to copy underworld I didn t realize they were literally copying it by having blades daughter take over as mc and she s going to be a hybrid lycan and vampire so just a blacksploitation version of underworld  wow
blade started the marvel movie franchise gonna be scary to see what they have done for the  modern audiences  perhaps the vampires identify by thier favourite blood type.
hear me out  here...  what s so bad about a cross-over with the two franchises   I would love to see  blade  underworld .  snipes was a badass in that role and its really hard to go wrong with putting kate beckinsale in spandex.  you can have blade saying things like  s    there s werewolves now !
as soon as you say  doomcock  I know that what comes after that is going to be sketchy at best.
john wick 4 coming in 2023 is our only hope for any male-lead movie in the next few years. trailer looks great.
just discovered you. your videos are great. subscribed
michael corvin was scott speedman s character  the descendant of the sole mortal of the corvinus bloodline.
I wanna see this script. it d be a hilarious read im sure
they need people like the old riders you know the people that created them have that heart that mentality not what they re doing right now.
all of this aside  please do not ever let them remake underworld!  they will only succeed in royally f   ing it up just like everything else they touch!
I really hope its getting a rewrite because disney is realizing that this woke garbage isn t bringing in as much money as it could of if it didn t take a political side . not sure though. I really dont think companies care about consumer dollars when they can get money directly from the source by having a good esg score. I hope they pivot though. I was an mcu fanboy. I rewatched the ones I like countless times. there s very few projects in phase 4 that Ive watched more than once. like I couldn t even finish love and thunder on second viewing.
we already have a perfect blade film...
shout out to you and your content. keep it up young lady
if they are going to destroy blade I hope it never sees the light of day
the fact the phase 4 vomitstandard blade script has been rejected by 3 directors is proof that disney are practically running on fumes.
now we have wakanda forever  id like to see them try that  m-she-u  line. havent seen it yet  but I bet. _jc
I d heard mahershala hated the script  and now I see why...
happy veterans day.  this reminds me of your video  girl gamer gets marine combat training in quantico .  too bad they didn t let you keep the gear for today.
apparently several test-screenings of indiana jones 5 resulted in  disastrous feedback
ok so I agree with a lot of what you said here in your video except with things about scarlet witch and america chavez out shining doctor strange in his sequel movie. it was america chavez s first movie  we needed to see what she could truly do  why she is worth saving aside from the fact thatshe is a child in addition to seeing just how far scarlet witch had fallen and how much she was willing to do to  save  her children. she is an omega level mutant in fact  plus if she s the main villain  she s going to get some serious screentime. either way  I just dont see how they outshines or overshadowed doctor strange in multiverse of madness   maybe Imissed something
busts in on dracula abducting lady  blade  vlad  what are you doing  you  sir  have got to do better
I was surprised to learn that underworld is a marvel thing  so it could work. but I think sony might have the rights.
somebody call kevin grevioux and danny mcbride.

love the john wick series.
Im hungarian  matthias corvinus was one of our greatest kings.
@nightbreed24  interesting  didn t know he was an actual historic character.
I see what you did there.

man... now I am gonna have to go back and watch the blade movies again...
I always love to see new videos from melonie. you look exceptionally cute today  too  melonie.
7 27 morbius  but that was disasterous for so many other reasons.you brought up an interesting point  because I had to think about it.damn near every recent production has had this stupid agenda thor love and thunderdr strange multiverse of madnessmoon knighthawkeyeof course shehulk was completely blatant with it.wakanda forever literally put all the men in the back seat.why the hell did blade need to be woke their gonna f-around and lose ali.
I love you melonie mac !!!! fable then blade this date is getting better
directors are seeing how wokeness is destroying cinema  and directors dont want to risk their career image with bad work.
why cant we have nice things a blade run where he is actively hunting for morbius would be cool.
Im right there with you about underworld. I dont want to out myself as this big of a dork  but my son s middle name came from the villain of the second movie. anyway  Im not going to pretend to know anything about blade  I saw the first two movies  and some of the third  but adding a werewolves versus vampires plotline seems like a pretty blatant ripoff to me  considering that werewolves didn t even factor in to the movies I saw.
we already have great blade films.
yes a new video. hey melonie
so sad. blade 1 and blade 2 are my favorite marvel movies.
there is a deleted scene from blade  trinity where hannibal and abigail fight werewolves. it was one of the alternate endings  and it looked ridiculous. while the movie wasn t all that great  Im glad they left that part out of the actual release.
I dont mind the passing of the torch story  but it has to be earned. even the son of the king had to serve in the army. the heir always has to train  to get to the same level as the master  and hopefully surpass or avenge him. thats the successor story. I dont think modern writers cantell the difference any more.
I kinda agree with her little sense of I want blade to be own his own first before bring in a kid let him have his full on story by himself and then maybe down line he has a kid or if they still going to  take story that have the kid barley in the scene and let blade be blade
the blade movies were some of my most favorite. I also totally love underworld. I think everyone wants to see amazing movies that are just awesome and not some woke piece of garbage with a message
imagine something being too woke for them.
every doomcock rumor vid has the classic  grain of salt  bitmelonie thank you for keeping the ball rolling in the right direction.
if they are going to rip it off can we just have kate bekinsale play him then   Imean might as well go full underworld
you are right about namor  because of aquaman being out first marvel are worried that people will accuse them of copying. aquaman and I dont  think people will check or care that aquaman is copying namor and I dont like how they are treating the very first marvel character in namor
this just proves that nobody can replace  wesley snipes
its sounds like they re about to pull a bait and switch with the blade movie.
thank you! going out for mom s birthday
@melonie mac go boom  I hope you have a great time!
I ll allow werewolves  but it needs to make sense in the bigger mcu continuity and with none of that wolf hybrid romance or mary sue girl power crap they always throw in. werewolves in the mcu have to do with asgard and fenris. unless there is going to be some crossover with thor or some asgardians in a serious setting  unlike all of love and thunder  then there s no point. might as well leave them out then.
exactly
chances are  you will like blade 3  after watching this reboot.
how hard is it to just use the comic book to make these characters. you have years and years of books to get an idea from itshould be easier than making something from scratch and if you dont change everything you will already have a fan base
the only way I would have possibly accepted the originial script storyline is if there was another guaranteed movie and it revolved around blade killing his out of control  crazy  power hungry daughter who devolved into sheer irredeemable evil  not sympathetic  maddness.
I feel like wesley snipes blade was great   they could build off it like get somebody the same skin tone   body type like him or make a storyline where he dies but has a son thts tryna get his body back from vampires   also learn about who blade was
wow if they did film this blade movie using this script the owners of the underworld franchise would have an excellent case against marvel disney for plagiarism. dont somebody like universal own the underworld franchise so they d totally sue  that would explain why the director baled after not getting a orginal script he would be dragged into any lawsuit and win or lose that would be career damaging.
half vampire  half lycan  but stronger than both.
underworld was a good series I just felt bad for how dirty they did michael
this is not a surprise. ive been tracking marvels suicide off and on for years  starting with the comics. modern marvel creators are addicted to destroying beloved characters. they ll destroy one then move on to the next. some things they know people hate  like rirI ironheart  in the comics  and they will still try to shove it down everyone s throat instead of taking an l and admitting they make crap.
disney s blade...everything wrong is in those words.
its hard to tell whether the writer s are actually being forced to  tick boxes  for marvel disney.at first I would say hire more kay cannons and less jessica gaos but but Im not convinced thats the problem. I honestly think that they are not given full creative control and the end result is what we ve been getting lately. c.r.a.p.
its been happening to black male characters. this isnt new. they actually nerfed tchalla in the original black panther by giving his greatest super power to his little sister shurI  and that is his scientific genius. in the comics tchalla was on par with tony stark   dr. doom and reed richards.
nice to see the use of  bossy  again. bossy and insufferable - a great desciption.
he s suppose to be a cold blooded badass who doesnt care about feelings
no....please no....this was one of my favorite movies.
I have an immense amount of respect for this bassam tariqj - massive power move. go full deadpool  marvel. 1 or 2 r movies wont kill u. sack up
yeah what a shocker that blade is getting woke rebooted
Im new here love the tats and the video is spot-on too. viva le revolution !!!
possibly  thats my best guess. as long as they can get mahershala a better script so they can make a good movie and maybe outdo snipes.
marvel studios present....blade  the adventure of his daughter
so  blade is going woke. then you got spawn going to be destroyed by jamie foxx. well  thatsucks. two of my favorite anti-heroes getting ruined.blade already has to deal with vampires and humans hating and hunting him.
so they could not use wolvebaine and use blade to introduce her then have a off shoot movie
even john wick 3 showed halle berry kicking more ass and then disrespecting john wick by giving him her spit bottle to survive in the desert lol
didn t it go  1st mike gets bit by lucian. then when tied to the board in the warehouse    lucian injected him with something  an activator  then when saline bitts him he has all 3 genes if you will  and the activator merging combining agent he becomes the future. simple  unless Im wrng and then never mind.
btw its good if it had an underworld theme
I am speaking with my wallet. for the first time I did not go see a marvel movie  wakanda forever  in cinema and will not be watching it on streaming either. maybe one day if these crazy people come back to their senses and make good movies without all the activism  I ll start watching again.
stop reduing these freaking movies.I really enjoyed the blade series movies with wesley snipes.its freaking shame directors cant comeup with new materials instead keepreduing movies that done great yearsago.melonie for bringing this iwanted wish u to have wonderful weekend takecare melonie
I see mahershala alI as a serious actor who takes pride in his work. if mahershala alI was threatening to quit I completely believe the script was trash
the blade charectar is one of the most male type of men you can get. and wesley did an awesome job as him. and now disney wants to ruin this legacy   of course they will. kinda not surpriced by that. sadly.
first you have blade first movie introducing blade and at the very end introduce his daughter but not in powerful way but in a nugget for the next movie where she gets kidnapped and bitten
at least there is a massive upside to all of this     disney is in such horrible financial shape that they are planning mass layoffs in the near future
marvel ended when disney brought them @yellowflash in his recent video he quoted a interview that the marvel team actively hired writers and directors that dont no the source material or hate the comics and let them rewrite it there way biggest examples she-hulk black panther etc
we have a literal plethora of blade comics and storylines. why are these writers making this complicated
I d be amused to see a movie where a vampire lichen is bitten by a normal person and then becomes normal and tries to cope with living like a normal person.that would be my whole premise  a vampire hunter who goes around biting vampires.
blade one and two  is 2 of the best movie ever make 100
nooooo I was actually excited for this one because blade is fucking awesome. everything the left touches turns to ash
why the hell does disney keep trying to make woke happen  how many times do we have to keep kicking their ass in the box office before they finally understand the lesson that we dont want to see it
how to make a good movie step 1  read the first 20 issues of the characters comic.step 2  adapt itshot for shot if you have to .
blade is my favorite hero. if they f ck with his character  I will not be a happy camper
Im dropping from the ledge.. Im booming with my blades of chaos    it feels  surreal
in a time of economic downturn its nice that disney is saving me so much money
r.i.p kevin conroy
it was smth to supress the transformation they need a pure human who carried he corvinus gene. michael could turn simply by adding blood of the 2 species. kinda like what happened with marcus.
blade without snipes  is like indiana jones without ford.
well  its a bit different  but there is a movie where a vampire bites a human which turns him back into a human. they live in a world where vampires have taken over the world  and humans are either hooked to machines for harvesting blood or are in hiding organizing resistance groups. a vampire is driving during the day in his nice car with sun protective shielding and ends up getting into a crash. he goes through the windshield into the sunlight but falls into some water which puts out the flames fast enough to save him from burning to death. somehow  the exposure to sunlight turns him back into a human. it just generates a lot of heat as well  and the water prevents him from dying during the process. another vampire  the main character  is looking to help the humans. he is a researcher looking for a blood substitute  so humans wouldn t be needed to support the vampires. however  even if a better substitute is created  there would still be humans hunted and harvested. when he finds out about the cured vampire  he tries exposing himself to sunlight in a wine making thing to extinguish the flames and turns back. he breaks back into his lab with the human group and tries to find a way to replicate it to cure everyone of vampirism. a fight with the humans and vampire army ensues. the first cured vampire is bitten and killed  but the vampire that drank his blood is human again. that newly cured vampire is bitten by more vampires all at once who all turn human. they realize the cure is much easier to spread than they thought.
idk how but youreminded me of this series called what we do in the shadows.
@sonnie pronounced s-au-ni  daybreakers
@chandler burse  thank you. I forgot the title.
facts
he will always be my batman.
how can you mess up blade of all things
snipes was amazing as blade and imo marvels best movies. if its not broke dont fix it. these ppl are destroying the entertainment we love on purpose.
saw this coming.
there is no such thing as tasteful wokeness. they have 3 successful films to take inspiration from... how fucking hard can it be. I could write a script for blad in half an hour. and I can guarantee it would be a hit.
sounds like someone read that blade has a daughter in the comics  introduced this year but teased several years ago as she was going to get a series but then they cancelled it to focus on the movie as they are basing the comics off the movies now  and then wrote this  article  to say that is the plot of the film...........so not true. Imean no mention of black knight  the co lead of the film
technically to be super accurate to the comics version of blade his daughter would only be like 1 8 vampire as blade is a half blood already.
Im not sure why it would be such an issue to recreate the original movie.  not shot-for-shot  but the spirit of it.vampires  blood  r rating  superhero violence on hordes of enemies... what s not to like about the 1998 classic
underworld was a good movie for sure  but favorite movie ever
blade should not be woke!! hes one of the most iconic bad ass alpha male characters.
unrelated but r.i.p kevin conroy.
if snipes was on this I d bet he would have walked
they re already planning his female replacement and he hasn t even been introduced in the mcu yet  seems right in line with the msheu.
I remember when they first announced disney marvels blade  I told people it was gonna suck and I guess Im right
I think the actor set to play blade this round might want to move on to something better.   he s not gonna want to be tied into this sh-- show of a mess.  lmao.  Im wondering how they re going to kill blade off so they can replace him with a fem blade.  he about to get the black panther 2 treatment Im sure.
hI first timer. have you seen blade the series 2006 . its not animated.it gives you his origins ye its pretty good. cheers from ozz
blade needs to be made the same way that werewolf by night was. I  as a fan of marvels mature content  was very sceptical about how they would make wbn  but it was perfect  and I hope the new blade will be as well.
underworld was great! thatsaid  I knew bad things were coming when disney bought marvel.
the man that wrote safe space and internet gas  wrote this blade movie yeah that comic book that never came out....
underworld was so good
hollywood ran out of ideas theyre rebooting and rewriting everything it died
1 4 .
@sonnie pronounced s-au-ni  thank you I suck with math early in the day lol.
the msheu version of blade wont be better than the original movies
off topic here is there any alternative indie stuff thats watchable maybe even good
I never cared for all characters but not my blade bro. pleaseeeee there so much depth  such a great character. wesley made the character so cool. blade was cool before black panther. to quote wesley snipes  some mfs always trying to skate uphill.
and I bet they would ve released it in all its wokeness if shehulk didnt do so horrible
you kno I do feel like dr strange was kinda nerfed I enjoyed multiverse of madness but yea they did down play him
disney stock to drop to 80  by antman and the wasp quantumania.sell it and buy at 50-60 when the board is fired.if the board is not fired disney stock may hit 40  per share.
anything disney touches now is toxic. the first two blades were fantastic and wesley snipes was perfect for that role.
kate backinsale  love her .. I also think that movie underr world is awesome
well  good for them  not sure who exactly  for recognising they were going to get heat for ripping off a well known 00s franchise. let s hope the rewritted pays off
why wont they just get the writers of underworld
these writers today have no real life experience. they only experience what s going on in their own little bubbles and echo chambers. to them thats life  its so ridiculous. they need to grow up and live life like a lot of us ordinary people do. to me and Im sure a lot of other people  wesley snipes will always and forever be blade.
wesley snipes will always the true blade  all the other blades are compared to.
so basically they dont want blade  they want female blade. my man hasn t even been in the mcu yet and they are already trying to replace him with a female counter part
the original wesley snipes movie was dope. the only part I did not like was the bad guy all of a sudden having a sword out of nowhere. what the heck
okay we need wesleysnipes back!! and a promise of blade3 antics ryanr jessicat carried thatshit and pretty good! fuckit bring blade3 team back
..laughably woke in a particularly distateful way. when is woke not distasteful
underworld main character never felt like a God character to mebut underworld movie are in the top 10 for me
I read that blade came out gay when he was 13 -disney
bear in mind  underworld simply ripped off  the love of monsters   with the gender roles flipped.  and twilight nearly reversed it yet again  but stupidly.
I dont know if I just missed the explanation or what but what happened to the verse of the day  Imiss those.
you have weekends and workers rights  correct  thats thanks to the progressive policies and demands from labor unions. or what you would now call  woke culture.
@doclager420  thats not what  woke  culture is these days. you are woefully behind the times.
just make the original blade trilogy cannon and then rerelease it lol.
have you noticed how every hero has a daughter  boys are pretty removed from every modern movie remake reboot pseudo continuation. a the same time these girls bring nothing of value  the story would be the same even if we swapped these girls with a hamster. and it would be really overpowered  flawless hamster.
really hope someone leaks the script
these vids are more entertaining than current marvel.  boom!
no! not my boy blade he hasn t had a movie in a looong time and the first one he gets in decades gets  hit with this
the she hulk disney msheu show was my favorite of all the bad woke  to come out recently. so much I got rid of the comic and my kids refused to watch any more marvel shows in future
I d sit here and hope pray and beg them not to f    up spawn but at this rate who knows. always been a huge blade and spawn fan but Im sure they ll figure out a way to destroy them both.
blade should ve been put to rest unless they can find a clone of wesley snipes anyway.
I dont have any issues with mahershala ali--he s a strong actor and I liked his villain in  alita  battle angel  and I think he could be a worthy successor to wesley snipes  og blade. the first two  blade  movies were fantastic and whoever wants to bring blade back to the cinema needs to take those movies as canon with a capital c. yes  the woke mob are extremely racist  and they will never ever admit it. the woke agenda will never ever jive with anything resembling good writing and acting  etc. its nice to hear a woman  you  calling it out  too! the bit about blade s daughter is indeed ridiculous  and to be expected  and Im not surprised the director walked. I am so tired of the female character having to be the bestest at everything and beyond criticism in any given movie comic book what have you  and its one of the reasons I dont give hollyweird my money anymore.
she gonna be da bestest vampire evvvvarrr.
of course they d re-write one of the few black characters I actually like. it wouldn t surprise me if this was true.
I saw black panther wauconda forever last night.  it was better then I expected  but this movie does respect the great chadwick bosmen. but I was shock how good the supporting cast was  and namor was badass. still not as great as killmonger.
your all time favorite movie is underworld!  really!
so cute as always  melonie.
feeding my family of squirrels whilst listening.  .wish I was joking
honestly hollywood just needs to go and hire a few pnp rpg gms. many make original stories far better than what is being churned out atm.
cant speak for the movies. but from what Ive heard elsewhere  they re just grabbing scripts from anyone for the shows. which is why they are such crap as of late and dont seem to be a part within the marvel tv movie universe as a whole. the importance seems to be to churn out content no matter how crappy it might be.
1st rumor I heard it has lack luster fight scene...
having a degree isn t as special as people think it is because they are literally handing them out for free.
doomcock  o pau do apocalipse
I like the story of batman and the robins  tim  dick  jason  and damien. if they are going to have the next generation  then itshould be more like that. itshould have the kids learn from the original  have flaws are naive at first  and respect the mentor father figure even if they dont agree with everything he says or does. itshould be a proper coming of age story for the kids as well as show how far the hero character has developed as a character from the beginning of his own story. the hero might learn a thing or two from the experience and help resolve some of his own conflict from his past  but he should be already at the top of his game with no doubt about his abilities. the kids shouldn t be anywhere near him in skill or power yet. and  they shouldn t start a new series about the main character with the next generational set up off the bat. he should be already settled into the mcu long before that happens.
@sonnie pronounced s-au-ni  yup  sounds like a good example. its also good life advice  where hard work and listening to right people will bring you closer to the success. opposite to that we ve had resident evil racoon city  where kids were just awful and father mentor figure was highly disrespected. its almost like modern entertainment tries to set up teens for failure.
thank you so much!
people nowadays lack substance  so their personalities become what they label themselves as or what they virtue signal
what woke writers do is model the characters after themselves  and their insufferable beliefs.
oh man  where s kevin grevioux and david goyer when you need them
wow they really wanna mess with blade  thats kinda messed up
everything has to be an allegory these days. its ruining all media. games  movies  tv. the only good news is its creating a burgeoning demand for anyone that has the skills.
as far as comic book movies black adam is the only recent movie that a male character hasn t been out shined and humiliated by his female co star
easy fix  either hire better writers out of the gate or tie these  gender studies  experts  earnings to the success of the project they create. bet the quality would increase tenfold. as for ease of proposed solutions  Imean  she-hulk was  story-wise  so it wouldn t take much to bring improvementsedit   kevin fay-j  lol
oh nooooooooooo a woke blade
for what I did hear the director as well as alI the dude playing blade didn t like it the direction it was going. and the direction that it was going to my understanding blade was going to pass the torch to his daughter bloodline.another version I heard was he was going to go through time and hunt vampires in the 20s 30s 40s 50s etc etc. just imagine a black man hunting white vampires in the 20s through the 60s . and the biggest head scratcher is why are they trying to wokify this character he s already a black character so diversity is there already.
thank you for the upload
I should write movies....if the bar is that low. really though I wonder if the bar is that low or whoever runs the companies that fund the movies get their hands on scrips and put in a bunch of horrible stuff.
they re murdering marvel!!! this should be a crime!!!
someone just get chad stahelskI already
what do we see that has a male lead lately that has come out in the past few years where he wasn t outshined by a female character  spider-man  thought its kind of cheating  given thatsony was the one to oversee it.
you need to do a video on iron heart. she had a cameo in the new wakanda forever trailer. its really bad.
honestly  blades a hard movie to do when youreally think about it  cause there really isn t anything you could do with blade that the weasley snipes versions hasn t already done  not to mention  blade himself is just straight forword a vampire hunter. not exactly a lot of diversity you can go with vampires since its just straight forword.honestly  I just think they need to pass on this film to be honest
just get snipes in shape and make some money.... and us happy for once.
Im hoping they didn t screwup blade like all the other flicks. I think they re off to a rocky start with the casting of blade himself and haven t heard anything about abraham whistler . wokanda for never is another nail in the disney marvel coffin   and those in charge faithfully believe in their garbage. I cant say Im excited to see where they go from here.
I never liked dave goyer s reworked  superpowered blade anyways. the cool thing about blade the vampire-slayer  well one of many cool things  was that he was in essence a normal guy taking on armies of undead that were stronger  faster and more powerful than he was. he was immune to be turned and he possibly aged slower than normal humans  but besides that  it was all skill  will and ruthlessness for the original blade. he lived a dangerous life  one false move and he was finished.besides  making blade a  daywalker  renders his best friend  hannibal king  the vampire private eye  kind of superfluous. not to mention  the daywalker version doesnt even speak jive like the original blade. I dont know  he was awesome and he s probably the most politically incorrect comic character there ever was.
rumour is even end game was going to be woke ascaptain america was meant to get beaten to death by thanos and captain marvel was going to beat thanosit was only because of the fan backlash to captain marvel that they changed it
I get marvel is supposed to be  the world outside your window  compared to its idealistic cousin dc  so of course youre gonna get stories that have some elements of our social and political climate....that being said... you dont have to be so oververt with it... sublety goes along way in writing.
they re  self proclaim activists who haven t experience struggles of life outside their bubbles  which was why their writings were all so shallow
his name was michael. and great video I hope this movie never happens.
remember in blade trinity when the cops attack his base and he doesnt make a black man and cops swipe.
blade needs to recast with richard simmons
I think jordan peele would be a fantastic director for the new blade. not only is he a genuine fan of the source material  but he actually knows how to use current events in tasteful ways that not only get the message across  but dont detract from the story.
Im glad the wesley snipes blade movies exist even trinity as bad as that was .
mahershala alI does not deserve this. he is such a great actor and a good guy.
I would love a good werewolf movie with good writers and not woke  maybe an actor not cgi. has anyone read any newer good werewolf books
they re not using reese. I am glad they dont drag my favourite marvel vampire through this. shame they do that with blade.
you were spot on referring to  wokeness  as a religion though it might be more appropriate to refer to it as a cult.
if anyone can ruin a great character Im sure that disney can. thor  captain marvel  the hulk s. I guess blade is next on their list
its blade but really about his daughter and no doubt she will be superior to blade with little to no practice like she-hulk is over hulk
well the reason they re diminishing the blade character is that gender is ranked higher on disney s agenda right now. plus they pounded into fans head that black panther was the first ever black hero. we re supposed ignore blade or spawn.
so instead of gender swapping blade... they gender swapped whistler... got it.
I normally dont like playing the gender or pronoun game but blade is a character that is depicted as asexual because he doesnt want to pass vampirism onto his children. they ve already fucked it up
does anyone remember the blade tv series   it focussed more on a police woman turning into a vampire than blade. it bombed. they have already done this shit  with the same character and it failed. blade is cool  blade is a badass  blade has already succeeded in mainstream movies by making a movie that leaned into this!
wouldn t it be easier to copy a storyline from one of the numerous blade comic issue of the past  they did it with keanu reeves john constantine movie.
Ive no problem with a female writer as long as they re honouring the character and adhering to the canon. Im more annoyed it ll probably be pg13.
since disney bought marvel over  it has been a funeral.
your plan is to replace one wokie with another one as tony said not a good plan
why would I want such a massive racist director  no thanks.
@itachI uchiha  I d rather have a woke director thats actually a good director  than woke director that doesnt know what they re doing.
@itachI uchiha  jordan is not terrible at putting messages in films. there is nothing wrong with movies having them and in fact most great movies do same for games they just dont sacrifice the plot for it.
I still blame twilight for the rise of woke vampire movies.
at this point it doesnt matter the race of a male in a movie or tv show. the  only thing that matters is the keyword male if it has a male character regardless of the race. a female has to be there that is stronger and better than the male. key example she halk attorney at law just the trailer with them training proves that. bruce banner or the halk picks up a boulder and tosses it with 1  of his strength because its training. and  in  training you dont use 100  of your strength you save that for a battle. thats a no brainer and obvious but his cousin picks up a boulder toss it forever and thinks she s stronger than him and acts like it. even though she s using all of her strength at the time. they show  her like she is automatically better than him until he picks up one next he puts effort into tossing  that boulder. then its like shut up Im holding back dumbass this is training. everything in the training he is holding back but she is putting effort into it and she thinks she s better than him. when he is putting no effort into it whatsoever. but they want people to forget its training and he is holding back to make it look like she is better than him. so thats their goal  to make the males weak  and the women stronger than the man.
yeah disney just ruined blade... we all saw this happening from the jump.
intelligent and gorgeous. God bless you  and God bless america!
great they re going to turn blade into butter knife.
underworld was pretty much world of darknesses  love of monsters.  they took so much from the world of darkness games. heh. though I did like .. most of it. but we dont need to wokify blade. Imean come on. we liked blade before they started dividing everything by color and gender again like disingenuous psychopaths.
they probably realized their version was even worse than morbius
I doubt you going to see this but I do recommend the movie  blood and chocolate you might like it
its simple  hiring practices for writers isnt merit based anymore. or at the least the lowest its ever been. you get hired based on nepotism  sexual favors  having the right political ideology  or filling a diversity checkbox.
why am I not surprised
blade needs techno music  badass fights and one liners thatshouldn t work but somehow do. blade doesnt need woke crap.
I stopped caring for mcu about 2 years now. after disney   came out I knew mcu would never be the same and I was right. I just had no idea it would get so pathetic. I just thought it would be more watered down and childish which it is. but its now beyond woke and terrible writing.
thats on the underworld two
the wesley snipes blade trilogy is perfect  I dont know why people hate on the 3rd one  just echoing opinions  they should just leave blade alone  its already a perfect classic. even if a good writer and director got a hold of it  they just need to let wesley have one of the greatest marvel portrayals of all time. if someone good does the film  they need to let wesley play the role.
Im just so tired of this this makes me want to make my own show even more  its going to have so many things these snowflakes will find offensive 3
thatscript was disrespectful to blade and everything he stands for
blade should be rated at least 18   because it is utterly a dystopia vampire world.  one thing about the modern vampire  they are eternal beautiful creatures  most are beautiful  for the storytelling there are ugly ones as well   so why do they care about human morality  because they dont suffer like humans   eternal creatures dont have the same values as mortal humans  and human death has little meaning for them.  vampires are not woke  they are evil-doers  and they have their own views based upon the eternal pleasures and power that they desire.  vampires are royal in appearance  and they rule their kingdoms  and there is a certain rank system.  in underworld  we see selene be a vampire princess  because a lower ranked one would have been killed by the others for disobedience.  as far as the weirdo  gender  studies writers goes  if you write yourself in the story  be a stable boy  because you ruin it  you never have to write yourself into any story  where you already use your values in your writing  including your religion  strange or not .  vampires are irreligious and they originate from the evil one in the original stories  and that means satanism  devil worship  and irreligious wouldn t be out of order.  as far as blade goes  he is a vampire who attacks the other vampires  and he is a rebel and traitor  therefore  this is a  save the cat  story for the movies  where blade has to do something to be likeable  and being woke isn t it.  as a vampire who preys upon human blood  blade might attack the other vampires  but to the outside observer  it is just about who gets to rule in their royal noble authority structure  and blade wants a better position.  the only way out of this is blade is seeking a way to become human again  and this is the only redemption that the audience could accept  in order not to be a horror tragedy story.
as far as dc goes they haven t done anything in a long time what suicide squad the second one was john cena and black adam with dwayne rock johnson I haven t seen them go woke yet
writers and producers are getting lazier and lazier and have the nerve to hate the fan base who brought success to beloved franchises.
disney is creatively bankrupt. these writers dont know how to think for themselves and create something new. they have to steal another studio s work or do a woke remake of one of their own earlier properties. its so sad.
such a disappointment how disney marvel insists on disrespecting their existing characters  especially blade  considering that he arguably started the marvel revival a full 10 years before ironman 1.
at one time I thought a movie could be both woke and good  which isn t possible. the movies are made by woke people for other woke people  and the woke ideology lives on an island separate from anything familiar. the hero s journey  trial and error  perseverance  internal conflict  traditional morals  and character depth dont exist within woke ideology. there s only 3 available roles at all times  the idiot  the oppressor  and the victim. the idiot is typically male with the current trend  the protagonists are both the victim and the oppressor at the same time. the main character knows better than everyone  has no faults  and all conflict is external while being related to being a victim  which they are a victim at all times. the upcoming blade movie will just follow the typical formula  with characters you cant relate to  where their are no boundaries of good or evil  because morality doesnt exist for the writers. until this whole woke garbage is over  I am stuck with watching documentaries  sadly even those aren t exempt from wokeness as the narratives are quite heavy handed.
why fix it if it isnt broken see that is what makes me mad there are so many things that woke disney is mesing up that is why I am into anime and light novels since 20 years ago
like how the heck do you even make blade woke ! dude just kills vampires. its so simple. you dont need anything more than that.
I bootlegged that first half of wakanda forever and notnreall6 interested in even going to steal the 2nd half for free.. just   ehhhhh. sooner or later I ll see it in sure
so which saying have yanks now changed to  grain of salt  endgame had two of the smartest men being outshined by a 14 year old girl.for a superhero film with a male lead that isn t outshined by a female you perhaps have to go back to toby maguire s spider-man.maybe the first doctor strange.
man  if they do make this new woke version of  blade I will not watching or support it in any way .
wesley snipes is a better blade than the current one
I canceled my d   and hulu package because its all garbage except for the ufc fight night streams  and I can watch those elsewhere.the just continue to trash characters so many are fans of. its not worth watching anymore. its certainly not worth paying for.good luck losing all the fan base that made the characters so successful in the first place.luckily the rock just saved dc. hopefully they continue in that direction.
top gun maverick was a really good movie.
when you take a rated r series and make a pg 13 movie  it ruins the edge that appealed to the original audience. look at robocop. when the third movie got a softer edge  the quality went down the toilet.  blade curses and so do his associates and villains  and blade is violent and he slays vampires.  blade doesnt need to be replaced by a woman  he is the coolest black comic book character ever committed to film  ain t that good enough
its like the writers and directors have forgotten what a movie is supposed to be. if you want to portray a  message   go make a documentary or something of thatsort. comic book and fictional movies are supposed to be for entertainment. movies and cinema is supposed to be an escape from reality.
yep I d rather stick with wesley snipes blade sure wesley may have problems but deep down he ll always be blade
I d rather be sexist and misogynist when it comes to marvel and what its doing to its characters then blind and naively susceptible to their self loathing woke agenda. and because Imight as well be since they re going to keep labeling everyone who disagrees or dont like wokism being pushed into every movie making it unenjoyable so... might as well be proud of it. maybe I can find a way to make a t-shirt out of it.
underworld-like   you mean  filmed with a blue filter
the funny thing is that this same rationale was the main reason why blade trinity is seen as the worst of the blade movies! how many instances of woke   broke do people need to see until itsinks in  smh
the mcu never should have touched blade. he already has 2 fantastic movies made with snipes in the leading role. we dont talk about the 3rd one  but even that is leagues above this dumpster fire. its not blade that needs the mcu  the mcu needs blade because he is one of the few  very notable black characters that has not been ruined by the woke culture yet.
speaking of dc why have you not done a video yet of kevin conroy the voice of batman who died the 10th this year of november 10th of 2022 intestinal cancer Ive already seen three videos about this already on youtube I didn t know this till last night when one of my friends of mine posted on to this on my youtube page
avengers endgame was truly the last of the decent marvel movies.decent does not mean excellent.
free westley snipe
Ive given up on marvel and the entire mcu.  haven t watched any of itsince infinity war.  get woke  go broke.meanwhile... spent cash to go see maverick  top gun iI in the theater... twice.  tom cruise knows what audiences want  and he delivers.
as a child  did you ever get so bored of replaying a game that you d find the cheat codes for God mode and just goof off  remember how the game became so easy that it just wasn t fun any more  and then you d just go back to playing it regularly again these people doing this are the equivalent of 10yo kids who have found the cheat codes to all our favorite ips. they re making their self-insert characters into Gods in those universes so they can pretend they re all-powerful. Im just waiting for them to grow out of it and go back to traditional storytelling.
marvel hasn t made a single hood movie since the end of 2021
honestly  I think both star wars and marvel were doomed from the moment disney bought them.
the underworld films wasn t to bad
I rate both blade and underworld as some of my favourite movies.. the thought these woke hyenas is getting their filthy paws on them is digustifying  its a word   .. I have reached the point where I refuse to see anything coming from the major studios now.. and do not get me started about netflix and amazon.. to cut to the chase.. wokeness has destroyed and will continue to destroy everything you know and love.. it is a disease  a cancer and a mental disorder thatshould  rightfully  be eradicated and those suffering from it.. be put in asylums.. or down.. both solutions are fine by me
blade is a black guy who grew up without parents  how much more woke do we need to go
blade started in 1973
agendas aren t the problem. some of the most famous authors we have write stories that are attempting to make a point. underworld is attempting to make several commentaries  including on the military complex  wars for the sake of wars  propaganda  etc . identity politics  characters without characters  is a problem. the inability to tell a story is the problem. bad story telling is the problem. and if you are going to be a bad writer  you should at least try to be an entertaining one.
rip kevin conroy
in the original script  blade was fighting ultra maga vampires that only fed off the blood of black people because they were r@cist.also blade was only in the movie for the first 15 minutes then he was replaced by a non binary trans vampire hunter.
I wont say marvel does not have female fans.... but I will say im most definitely positive that the majority count are men.to have the majority people back the movies for nearly 15 years and then just throw all the shit away to a woke agenda.... its ridiculous
underworld was cheesy but fun
its a shame because I like mahershala alI and want to see him in a blade movie. I think he would be a good fit. he was the best part of the abysmal luke cage series even though he was constantly neutered all throughout.
I blame disney 1000
feminist would go crazy if company s started switching out every female character with a better more smart male counter part so calling males misogynistic is stupid
blade is the last hope for a cool black male super hero for years to come since black panther woke-kanda forever failed. no offense sam its possible I just expect your films to be drowning in politics rather than just being a fun movie. best of luck to you guys hope you get some cool content before the msheu kicks you out too.
so they want to ruin blade now
if youremember  the writer for blade  was held up for being  the first black female  to write a marvel movie. she was not hired for merit  but for social credit.the problem is  marvel cant fire her without getting burned down by the people they were trying to appease.
one writer  hey how about this title   vampires  the gay blade
I dont agree luke cage was a very good series broke the internet at one point if the focus and writing kept to the source and the ny music and scene it could have been monumental long live luke cage
@scott kirkland  he spent the entire series moping around about what happened to him  whining about not wanting to fight and basically doing nothing. he only had one real show of his super strength when he destroyed a barn and that was it. a super hero series without any super heroism. dont even get me started about the final big bad guy  mr. daddy issues. the whole series was a joke and a colossal disappointment.
notice how all the non-masculine  men  are the loudest and the first to defend the m-she-u...but never on its merits or good qualities...just  oh  youre not man enough to handle a strong female character!!  lol to which I reply....when I was 12 or 13 and I saw linda hamilton in t2  it forever set my  type  in real life lol and yes..before I get attacked by marvel stans I know Im fatphobic for being primarily attracted to fit muscular women....lol
blade is the only day walker its not hard to write a movie around a vampire that hunts others vampire.they ve just proven that it doesnt matter about you color or religion as long as your a man  your wrong.
I want a new ghost rider movie but only after the woke has left marvel
I think bpiI is going to pass the billion. it is betr than the first  for what that is worth. but thr is not a male in the whole film. it is less annoying  bc of the situation.  _jc
I need a gf like mel! lol
too bad there s no other source material for them to use.
they shouldn t have even entertained the idea of doing blade at all. they cant do it right and have proven that with everything else
oh  they got my boy
you got to realize that the whole woke thing is disney because they own marvel when youre talking about dc thats owned by warner bros
I always thought that underworld was a ripoff of blade and vanhelsing. .
this is going about as well as I expected it to. its woke marvel disney now. marvel was dying by endgame. it died when tony sark died.
looks like marvel is going to be out of the game for a while
its starting to feel like its the same group of people who always want to write this bs
that mic is really in the way...
if true smart of them to scrap it if true
you know. nobody would be able to make better movies than the first ones of blade. not today with these people. you know what I would do  I d add blade as a character of importance to some plot in a spiderman movie or maybe his own blade movie  doesnt matter  but with spiderman and morbius of course. a different  new morbius  not cringy. once the rights to the characters are lifted of course.blade  now old  starring wesley snipes again. would be searched for and found in secret  retirement  after removing all vampires on earth singlehandedly long ago. spiderman would have to join forces with him to defeat morbius  which is a new kind of vampire.blade would probably whine about how now the world is safer and a mess  and doesnt need him to defeat morbius since its got avengers  Gods  mutants  that didnt exist when he was young  etc...this 1 minute idea out the top of my head pretty sure is 999  better than whatever they are making right now.
nooooooo! just fry me! fry me now! extra-extra crispy!
thank u for the real
melonie you are beautiful young woman yeah whatever call me a simp. I rarely ever give anyone a compliment. her personality is so sweet its hard not to like her.
oh  gender swapped blade   dead in the water!
they cant do blade like they did thor the original blade was too good
in my opinion there is only one blade and that is wesley snipes.
I think you are reading to much into it.I think you have a selection of writers who are in hollywood  and they are told to write a script on  blank  property.instead of doing research on what had come before  they just  write what they know   and ignore previous cannon.sometimes it works  however  most times it doesnt.
all you have to do is say disney  and thats the answer to anything woke. we should rebel  against this and just watch the old blade movies  even allow us to watch it in  theater s. I dont get how disney cant stick to the program. also I noticed everything in marvel is all about Gods. what the hell happened to an average guy  being super strong  with an accidental power  also why dont disney take the son of these heros and give them roles
the modern version
at this point I dont care anymore  phase 4 has done more damage that I dont think I d be interested even if phase 5 turned it around  I just dont like the characters we have in the mcu now
doomcock is usually right all the time. kathleen kennedy hates him for indiana jones 5 leaks lol
when you have to say allegedly thats hate speach and misinformation
mcu ended with the ininity gauntlet saga. no more money from me.
what can you say  some mfrs are always trying to ice skate up hill.
I knew this was gonna be trash disney isn t good enough to make a blade movie
just want to say  blade cant rip off underworld  since their whole style was a rip off of the wesley snipes blade movies. so how can blade rip off blade
how long canthis continue its seems like a losing business practice
lol. they be like heath ledger s joker. its not about money its about sending a message. lol. with the way they push this agenda.
disney has the sadim touch  see sraw rats
God those eyes are gorgeous!
fun fact underworld is a ripp of ov vampire the masquerade
no snipes no sale.
uhhhh very good points
whatever happened to just reporting facts  everything here is all  hearsay  and rumors while the rest is of you giving your opinion on said rumors. even he said the video is all rumors and hearsay  and we re taking it like its all facts  all just to say  you heard it here first .
why they make terrible quality  cuz desalination of salinity in the markets. too many good quality  people get bored. also  they dont know what to do whenever they have reach the peaks.
if the movie is going to be pg13 I dont give a shit what disney does  it wont be worth watching.
who s this superfox !
I thought blade was about vampire slaying and tragic romance   this was the only black character next to luke cage I liked as a black guy dont tell me they gonna make it woke plz dont
she cantalk to me all day and I would never get bored shes yowie wowie cute
they aren t rumors
you go girl!! low life trying so hard to impress us
disney just needs to shutter marvel and lucasfilm  fire all the employees and producers and administrators  and just focus on making the theme parks good like they used to be and cycling their old and actually treasured products across the streaming service.  dont make anything new until all the moronic ignoramuses have been escorted off the property and replaced by people without expensive and asinine college degrees.
bizarre.
good vid siski
yeahhh broo underworld was awesome and she was a girl. like bro this is bs what are they really trying todo. I think they have a plan by letting these weird people make movies or its always been like that
everything woke turns to shit
they better not f up blade!         or someone  exceedly literally not me   is metaphorically vampire hunting via literally literally dark soul invasion in the playstation game a bunch of game characters cosplay as daywalkers in the dark souls game literally .
where did all these woke writers come from
so a new not cannon with plagiarism of copy n paste yah I agree with a lot here I gotta see this script I self lol.
no. .... no..... noooooooo!!!
woke broke
not blade why do these people be in positions to write things
everything marvel went downhill when stan died. rip stan lee
blade  are you kidding me  they cannot wokify blade the day walker! I gladly have the original trilogy so Im sticking to that!
probably because disney s stock broke the 90 dollar barrier a few days ago. they ll rewrite blade but you know they cant help but make it lame. just watch the old blade movies if you want some blade.
critical drinker said wakanda forever sucked
love ur tattoos
they ll probably also gay up blade s daughter and have her date a white or asian girl. the usual trope.
so his daughter is gunna be la magramixed with dracula just to be better than blade then... smh
is it pronounced    fygee   feige   feegee   feege       we have to get it right so the correct person never touches film again
in this story  blade has a daughter that- okay  Ive stopped right here. fuck this movie already.
shit what they did to black man and black panther they need to do better for blade
Im for real never watching marvel again if they make blade  for modern audiences
they had better not make blade gay or some shiite like that.  or have him emasculated and stay in the sidelines while a woman takes the lead and acts like the actual blade character. edit  oh shoot the daughter character is the one that takes the spotlight... another bait and switch.  damn.
I am not surprised
I feel like if we dont watch wakanda forever the woke will die from marvel....
I want blade to be more like wesley snipes blade God damn it!!!!!!! im tired of this woke shit......
make itstop...
there is no way blade will be good in the mcu. they just dont have the balls to follow up on the 1998 movie
wow  they tried to make the director seem incompetent   that it was all his fault for the setback when it was the shitscript feige was pushing  also  are you going to make a video about the derry  women s  beauty pageant winner  lol...
I have a hard time not simping you. dang youre cute.
rewrite just to make it even worse  genius

hey cool melonie  and dogs  why it has to be all woke these days  I wonder if the new blade movie is going to fail as saint row did.
they will probably use the eddie murphy vampire movie next but without the funny.
since the woke attack on our media men have moved to buying some h games with female protagonists that corrupt over time lol ive worked one ill disclose if interested must be 18 and up
I just pray netflix does not f up gears of war
his name is kevin fi-ge   sorry just bothered me
love you
does woke scare you  do you have nightmares about woke
woke is a religion   you nailed it.    they have been given over to a reprobate mind.
michael corvin
blade like  xmen and a bunch of other things will probably suck in the mcu and would be better kept in separate universes
if they ruin blade Im done with all there content
ever since they neutered my favorite character frank castle Ive had little interest in marvel except to mock their current trash.
kevin phage.
lol huh interesting
they treating us like white men now. we cant get a break
@meloniemacgoboom
- damn  seeing a woke blade will be really awkward. that is one character and film that if they put that kind of obnoxious message crap into it  its gonna look so just off for the atmosphere and the character. he doesnt give a shit about identity politics beyond bloodsucker and human. he would not give a damn about tranz pronouns...
here s a story for you boom thats what you call yourself when underworld came out in 2003 I was in a bad mood that day but my friends dragged me to it and actually I had a good I got to go see a good movie at the sutter theater plumas street yuba city california its there now that doesnt do movies anymore now its just its a r theater now
technically in the original blade wesley snipes was a supporting character in his own film. marvel sucks so bad now I dont even care about any of their tv shows I only watched moon knight because Im a big ethan hawke fan.
now I guess the african-american gentlemen are going to have to get involved and start suing disney for being racist
I already made up my mind about not watching the new blade movie  because wesley snipes wasn t playing the role. to me there s only one actor who plays that role. just like only one actor can play john maclane. now they re going to try to ruin the character with this woke agenda. first it was han solo  then luke skywalker  the terminator  and now blade. pretty much every single one my childhood heroes has been ruined by this woke bull crap. I really hope a meteor  earthquake or some sort of natural disaster wipes hollywood off the face of the earth.
its ok underworld ripped off vampire the masquerade. also blade was first in those films. me being a fan of blade vtm   and underworld.
I just know they will
if you see any women as the main leads  you can be certain.
@melonie mac go boom  yeah gotta face the facts not one movie game related have been taken serious  aspecially now that xbox is going woke with fable  if they do that to any other title I will never support the again
love you too!
@melonie mac go boom  my queen
writers suck these days
hopefully phases 5 and 6 wont have any  woke crap tarnishing x-men and secret wars
blade ruiner
talking about a male lead in the past few years  I only say  black adam .   but yeah  thats the dceu  not the mcu.
marvel has killed off 7 male characters and introduced 15  for female characters its 0 of 27. this is in phase 4 only.
this is why I dont bother watching new movies or shows from hollywood anymore.  because woke has destroyed practically everything.
oh its a cartoon
kevin faij
just decision rewriting the script  if it was anything like the crap  underworld  sequels I would scrap it too
no no no not blade please not
if its woke people need to just start boycotting it.  everyone needs to just boycott everything woke and make sure the people paying for the movies understand why and hopefully when they literally all go broke their investors will overwhelmingly push zero women movies and series or they pull their funds
Ive got the wesley snipes trilogy on dvd. not interested in the current marvel silliness.
smash the vamptriarchy !!  vamp lives matter !!...
Godzilla
I loved the original blade movies and the original underworld. marvel will screw up yet another movie
melonie u live stream games  u gonna play gow ragnarok
dont fuck with blade...
I will not pay to see another movie in a movie theater for the rest of my life and I invite everyone to do the same. these hollywood elites and actors have gotten to big for their britches and forgotten that we pay to see good movies and good acting. america doesnt want to hear about this new woke agenda crap and if we going to movie theaters it hurts them where it counts  their bank accounts. if people stop paying for movie tickets they cant afford to make movies or even pay these actors  20 million to be in the movie. I think movie theater will be totally out of business in the next 10 years.
m she u
asking what happened to sears   remember the softer side of sears when all the commercials were for women  oh yea they no longer exist.
I was very interested by the new blade movie when I first heard it  but after watching this video  I ll pass.
not sure you should be calling doomcock s videos rumors. his track record is pretty terrible and he always leaves himself an out in every rumor.
how to destroy yourself  hire delusional people.
dear hollywood  please stop making movies.
uses the word woke nowadays   opinion discarded.
the new and improved  blade  will probably end up being up a female to male indian trans racial activist who is a lesbian.
hey stop upstaging the main character.
these people act like no woman or poc has ever been strong or ever been a lead in a film and they are the ones to somehow save them and give them the first opertunity their race gender ever had....its wierd....and patronising  and maybe even a bit racist  all the things these people claim to be against
wait if they make blade woke  would that mean he is a white woman now
what I keep saying... all these writers and character creators have no originality. which is why I hand pick shows that I watch. I no longer go to the movies or even watch any... as soon as I catch a drift of wokeism... Im done.
as always love the videos but need to add  rip kevin conroy  the one true batman.
damn...thats garbage...speedmans character was named michael corvin.
they have gotten carried away since captain marvel. this woke energy is ruining everything. I dont expect anything to be good anymore.
doomcock cannot be trusted. anything that comes from him is probably false. still  this movie is in shambles. Im concerned for blade s mcu appearance.
stop  I need a properly written  r-rated  action mcu movie in blade  none of this wokeist bs.hollywood  just f   ing stop  you ve done enough  too much even.
movies suck now
not only did blade exist before underworld they were nothing alike blade was actually darker and more gory than underworld and if Im not mistaken he s also supposed to be a marvel superhero why cant you make new s    leave the old s    alone quit changing s
this is no surprise look what they did with black panther 2 chadwick boseman passed away which is tragic Im a fan but t challa the black panther did not so what s disney do they took the opportunity to replace him with a woman. they literally kill the character and replace him with a female in the first ten mins of the film. considering the character was a hero to children in the black community I d say that was pretty racist of disney.
dude evolution   ps bloodwars never happened  bw doesnt exist
did somebody say my name!
bahaha
@melonie mac go boom   lol
woke blade  what is he trans or something. how can you woke that ip
there is no blade without wesley snipes.  marvel blade will be trash
its like they re trying to ruin this movie. first wakanda forever now this shit!
there s already a female blade. its called underworld. they ran out of white characters to bastardize they are going for black heroes next.
they better not turn blade into a woke politically correct character otherwise we riot
marvel is like mcdonalds. fast  kinda good and see you later. lazy writing and obviously aimed at families. gen z dont watch good movies with such a beautiful story and acting. when they see an actor crying like tom holland  rdj or that woman in bp2 they think the cast deserves an oscar
this whole wont crap needs to stop thats why men need to start suing disney just start swimming in general for a sexist towards man slander and possibly a hate crime
create new unique stories. leave classics.
sounds like they were ripping of the 4th underworld movie  the weakest of the franchise. disney marvel must be desperate
Im sure it degenerates the black man in both versions.
so... another  I use the name of a well known character to make a movie show were a completely new female character is the same as the well known character but is better at everything when will be boring enough for them to stop doing that we dont want a copycat mary sue. we want brand new badass heroines. its not that hard. even men can do it.  see  the first alien movie  the first terminator movie  gone with the wind movie  the first hunger games movie  kill bill  ...
another gd damn bait and switch and this time is a freacking rip off  this seriously is one of the lowest thing they would have done.
you pronounced kevin feige wrong. you pronounced it like beige. it is spelled alike but not pronounced the same. how can you be a marvel film critic and not know who he is  smh. youre cute tho and Im an unattractive guy that cant get a girlfriend  so I will continue to watch your videos. lol
why did they need to copy underworld  because its all about a damn female.....its about a damn women!!!!!thats the point  lol.
wonky fake college degrees...  gender studies .
what the what!! the copy because they are lazy!
cute top girl.
just another franchise I wont go and see cuz the disney mcu is trash now
his mom was bitten by a racist white cop. so powerful
marvel announced major layoffs this week. it proves the  go woke  go broke  idea. its one thing to kill the golden goose  but its another when you sodomize the goose and then try to justify the buttigieg approach to movie making.
even God of war ragnarok is like a feminist wet dream
underworld isn t even the best underworld movie
wow. such lack of creativity that they feel the entitled need to ripoff underworld.
good  actually brung in wesley snipes to consult  the original script sounded like
who is watching these movies  I haven t gone to watch a disney movie in years... my children certainly wont be watching them either.
Im just surprised they didn t cast antony starr as blade. because muh representation and diversity.
who is  bounding into comics   what credibility do they have  what are their sources for their rumors  any actual evidence other than clickbait views from culture wars
Im not going to watch this even if my brothers  state that you  melonie  and rkoutpost and geeksandgamers and every other conservative reviewer out there are haters. watching movies and content for free  because I pirate  is difficult enough as it is especially with me having adhd and finding it difficult to pay attention  I can have movies and tvshows go unwatched for a long time before I get to them. I am not wasting my time watching a one our movie where blade saves a young female clone of himself  they did this to black panther  final fantasy and now blade  Im voting with my wallet now  hater or no hater.
I lik most of ur takes but damn u can be hella toxic sometimes Jesus
this was just going to be a pathetic woke rip off of underworld  so sad  I loved the blade movies. by the way critical drinker reviewed wakanda  he could not stop laughing trying to explain the stupid plot  itsounds horrible.
no black men are still black men  its just our turn again..
no  no you dont understand  this time it ll be under world  but with a black guy
I know wokeism is annoying but why does this channel give me a genderbent nerdrotic vibes
underworld is kind of good but dont we already have one elsa bloodstone from werewolf by night well written also this is a rumour the mcu is not woke none of that bullshitstop putting cringe thumbnails.
if a woman is the main character of blade  I will not be watching.
melonie mac the woke is not a religion its a colt while religion has its fair share of problems they are not fanatics which is what this woke is
I wont be watching it. may woke go broke.broke. im sick and bored of the attention seeking community. done. the card doesnt work.
interesting how you state not supporting these type movies with our wallets to speak out  but yet state right before that youre gonna see wokekonda   support that very garbage.
you are born a vampire or not  blade was born a half vampire believable  his daughter gets bitten and her  vampire powers  awaken  and that makes her stronger than blade  bullshit  then she drains him and becomes a God... not even remotely believable  way to rip off my favorite movie series underworld and trash blade my second favorite vampire series.
youre confusing. stay woke which in the black community means to keep an eye on the dominant society. the woke you speak of is the dominant society s version which means do whatever you want  say whatever you want  and women are more re than equal than men.
blade should always be rated r.all of the hero movies these days have been hijacked by progressive nuts that force woke bs and try to be funny. Ive lost all faith
I gave up on movies a long time ago. if everybody did what I did hollywood would go broke and they would be forced to change their ways. stop supporting this.
blade dies in the first act but dont worry  his  trans homosexual uncle whistler takes up the mantle. to battle a male only race of black vampire shadow monsters  I really had high hopes for blades return now........not so much.
everything woke is distasteful....
even the blade anime was better than this crap
a pg-13 version of blade thats also a sloppy jalopy rip off of underworld thats also for the shitsunday trifecta everyone woke as fuckI dont know about you guys but I hope its not rewritten I wont blade to come out exactly as they have it right now so I can point and laugh at disney s disgraceyeah if you couldn t guess by now I dont give a damn about modern marvel I completely canceled out noped out after end gameand I didn t even watch all of the movies before that because Imight seem like an alien and not from planet earth when I say this but the mcu has never been my thing comics has always been my thingso yeah dont rewrite the movie just put it out as isall of your handsomely paid propagandists.. oh Im sorry Imean friends in the media and entertainment news industry we ll just say that the woke joke of an underworld sloppy jalopy reboot thatstars blade for some reason was a complete and total masterpieceand not just a complete and total masterpiece but the best movie marvel has made so far a tear jerking emotional roller coaster of a ride with suspense and thrills and a whole bunch of other crap that can probably throw in thereyeah come on man you know the thing fuck it just put it out
girlfriend  doomcock is wrong 90  of the time. his  inside sources  aren t worth a damn.
b movies on syfy are better
sure  lay to rest yet another strong black male character   we see you marvel.
hi
to answer your question melonie mac marvel has no talent writing comics movies and shows thats why
Im a person of color  I am left wing and have the voting reord to prove it but here is my two centsthor and lokI were ruined...and replaced with more capable female charactersthey were humiliated for no reason and made into stupid bumbling incapable charactersblack panther was replaced with a woman despite the fact that the king is the black panther not the queen and the position is earned not inherited by title.now blade is being ruined.social justice matters...movies are not the vehicle for it.  they are junk food of media to begin with and when you shoehorn in this crap the message is lost because it ruins the story to the point where no one wants to see it
well this going to flop
Im already not interested in this shI  marvel is so useless bruv
marvel is so bad that I would even watch a pirated copy of any phase 4 movie. such woke trash and kevin feige needs to be fired along with victoria alonzo in order to even save anything.
do youremember how cringey 80s Christian movies were   as a Christian  it was embarrassing. they had bad scripts  bad acting  shoehorned moralism  hamfisted direction.thats what disney marvel is now  except replace Jesus with  woke
get your own f     superheroes
iconically laugh when youtube channels try to make itseem that the black man is making the white man the oppressed. how many  black writers do you think that there are in the writing room right now creating captain america iron man miss marvel marvel characters  you have one black writer named ryan coogler who s overseer is kevin feige. now do I believe that ryan coogler made the first and written the first black panther yes. do I believe kevin feige wrote the second movie 100 . do I think that he handed it off to ryan google and said here this is what youre going to do yes 100 . anthony mackey the actor that plays falcon he doesnt work you can have tons and tons of footage of him just being a man. he s very old school when it comes to anything. chris evans who plays captain america he s very woke and he s a feminist. but instead of you guys being in tree by sam wilson becoming captain america which is actually a mantle because the government owns captain america not black panther. you guys wanted to scream woke us and they only giving him the shield because he s black I find that funny because you guys rather give it to a russian nazI guy who s control because he s white but you guys want to blame wokeness on black americans especially black men where we have the most difficult time getting into hollywood much less being a leading man. and every time we are leading man idiots write us as the joke or put us in a dress now who s really being oppressed white men or black men because itseems like a black man cant be the lead of his own movie without 25 black women telling him how to be a leader. but for some reason youtube channels like your own keep trying to make it like black men or so in charge of anything they have a white director on asian director doing the blade movie they had a white screenwriter for blade again being woke happens in more white movies than it doesnt black you guys just notice it a lot more because guess what marvel only actually has two black movies now black panther and black panther too which are sequels out of 30 something movies and you guys want to sit here and talk about how the black man is depressing your white men get the f    out of here. no they re pushing a feminist agenda. it has nothing to do about race or portrait thats what they re trying to blind you but at the end of the day its about sexuality and trans people. but idiot youtube channels like this will try to make itseem that the reason scripts are being trashed because the black man is trying to push some racist narrative on the way we re not going to be further from the truth. itseems like white actors and white directors and white writers keep pushing that narrative so you guys will stop liking black movies. you have no problem blaming the black actors the black superheroes on the big screen but you dont really try to get and the depths of reality of how they came to be. but when you see a white woke after a white woke script a white woke writer and a white director you all just say the movie was bad and we didn t like the agenda they were trying to push on us but you dare not even look at the actor who s betraying all of it dont you find out a little bit interesting.
cant wait to see a strong woman lead be given to a trans woman. drag cat women. make bayonetta non bionetta. a trans captain marvel might actually better.
brilliant  another shit nobody will watch. underwoke would be a good title
I wouldn t say 90  but he does have a middling track record to say the least. still waiting for kk to be fired.
entertaining anyway.
you didn t watch my video and left a big old comment with no facts behind it  clearly. I was defending black men in this video against how the woke mob is treating them. might want to actually watch the videos you comment on
I like the video but for God s sake learn how to pronounce kevin feigie...he is literally the source for all your videos content. and the entire mcu...good and bad
question for  smart  girl.why is Jesus depicted as a blue-eyed white man instead of a brown man from the middle east
more interesting  underworld is your all time favourite movie    what  a lame generic vampire action flick headlined by an even worse leading actress. there s at least a 1000 films infinitely better than underworld. I cant believe you.
well  afro-american churches depict him as a black muscled dude lol. anyways  its a salty ill-written fairytale character  so why bother
@                she is expert for  wokeness  thats first example
