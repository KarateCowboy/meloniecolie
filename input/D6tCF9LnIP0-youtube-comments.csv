the advice you gave about not bending the knee to the woke mob is spot on. never apologize and just be you.
Ive been happily married for 18 years  and am so glad I dont have to deal with the headache of dating these days. I thought it was nuts when I was young. yikes. you kids have all kinds of crazy you have to deal with now that we didn t.
youre the first person Ive ever heard that has the same opinion about aliens that I do.  also  when you dont have a massive car payment  you can buy more games and manga.  an insightful video.
mel always spitting 100  facts
I caught this video kind of late  but I just wanted to say you have the best audience interaction of any youtuber ever. btw  some people believe the movie signs features demons as  aliens   given the film s theme of faith  the appearance of the aliens  the way the dogs reacted to them  the fact that the water burned them  doesnt make sense for any organism to be harmed by water  alien or not. the water is supposedly holy water  but Im not sure how it was supposed to be blessed   and the fact that the father s praying drove them away suddenly and mysteriously. also  the movie never show s their  ship   because its invisible.
mel  you always give good advice! thanks!
keep up the excellent work  melonie.
I imagine about 75  of the q s were  are you single   lol  if not marriage proposals.
super single as well  always a chore to find someone with similar values and as an introvert dont tend to put myself out there much so feel you on the struggle
you deserve someone who is always willing and ready to stay and give you a hand whenever you need one  someone who love and respect you enough to never cheats on you someone who sees your struggle as our struggle and who stand with you till you win over your challenges  someone who brings you hope when you cant see any  someone who brings you assurance when all you have is doubt  someone who chose to stay no matter the weather or situation someone who s there to celebrate you at your best and cheer you up at your worst thats who youreally deserve in your precious life
hey mel  was great to hear an update on how things are going for you! so happy to hear you are still the awesome mel I found on twitter way back when you started with smoe cool tweeking along the way. stay strong and happy my friend.
hey mel hope all is well. missing your content. its definitely a pick me up when I have a shitty day.
can definitely relate. dating can be goofy sometimes in many ways. somebody has to be the one to take the first steps or make a move forward.
regarding the alien stuff what are your thoughts on the doom franchise  also  gonna toss duke nukem 3d in there as  literally depicting that nightmare  you described.
melonie. I usually cant watch your videos because I always very busy. but I come here to show my support with a like and comment
you dont sound crazy at all. my thinking is along the lines of yours and similar ideology. btw  dont be worried about the being single thing. I once went 3 years single  Im a guy for those wondering . anyway  single again  six months now. no worries  take itslow. find that person. good luck!
I wish there was a way you and us in your community could just jam out about ct s and not have to worry about corpos freakin  out. would be so fun
melonie  if you have knee pain from working out make sure you take joint support everyday. msm  glucosamine  and a turmeric blend. amazon has a great one that Ive been taking for years. I think the brand name is arroz   Im a bodybuilder and it works great for me. highly recommend
you need more of these  melonie!  d
you have done alot of research on fitness in general. you cantell by the way you present it. I do not love hit at all. so im a steady state guy myself. the best kind of cardio is the cardio you enjoy doing. love your content.
indeed
good advice. yet kind of impractical since they control everything these days
as soon as you apologize to the woke mob you automatically admit you are  guilty  of whatever crazy social crime they accuse you of committing. then they judge you harshly. the best strategy is to directly state how crazy they are  note they are harassing you and not vice versa  then go about your life. they have short attention spans  will give up  and move on to some other target.
@dan  if you do apologize they will enter in a frenzy and swarm you even harder.  nothing you could say would ever be enough. what they actually want is to rip you apart.  dont apologize  say your piece and go on with your life. they wont stick for long when they see they have no power on you.
lucky you man. these streets are rough.
same here. Ive been in a happy relationship for the last 10 years now  and I dont miss anything about being single at all. dating was so miserable.
man now imagine as a Christian  its even harder Im like man youre great but there s no way I can see a future without her being Christian. she might reject our children being Christian  might change and get fed up years later and cheat etc. especially western women Im arab  so cheating is like one of the more foul things someone can do in a relationship.
been married for 10 its nowhere near perfect but I d prefer it than the chase the male player types think the chase is gonna be fun forever but eventually they ll tire out he ll even the loose women start wanting to settle. modern dating is simply people denying they want a long term relationship until they get to an age where an ltr is more favorable than tinder swiping
@adaptive gamer  Im agnostic  and dating a Christian woman right now. been going strong for 2 years. planning to propose to her soon. Ive been warned of some of the stressors she might have  dating someone who doesnt share her faith. if we get to have children  I would not be opposed to her raising them Christian. I have zero intention or desire to cheat on her. I want to support her in her faith  but I cant bring myself to believe in her God.
@adaptive gamer  I hear you  but my ex wife was Christian as am I  but she still cheated...so its no guarantee whatsoever.
there s no room for aliens in our universe  there s plenty of room  enough to fill it will billions and billions of earths. there s so much room.
actually  I used to think the same thing but its fairly popular among Christian s to believe this
I agree people get so offensive
how
@m pautu  with her mouth and brain
@theflgators17  how
I think the shredded look will cut back on those.
this is my wish for you comfort on difficult days smiles when sadness intrudes rainbows to follow the clouds laughter to kiss your lips sunsets to warm your heart hugs when spirits sag beauty for your eyes to see friendships to brighten your being faith so that you can believe confidence for when you doubt courage to know yourself patience to accept the truth love to complete your life.wishing you an great year  prosperous future  joyful life!  _
great content! thx for sharing us your deets. love your laughter
I live in the uk so definitely too far away haha but you seem like the perfect girl to me. I too am someone that is growing in my faith and let me tell you it is so hard to find a decent woman over here who has a good moral compass  who isn t part of the woke agenda  and most women in the uk now days dont want to talk about Jesus or the Bible in general
money is a joke.my heart is lifted cause of your spiritual gift of wisdom from above. is encouraging to watch you growing in the Lord. children of the last days we are. Imay comment more often on here. thanks for sharing  sister.oh  and thanks again for the beta key you gave me for the game wildstar. was years ago  fun game.
weird that I was going to suggest some shrimp in your diet for the iodine but then you said later in this video that you were already going to change to that for a bit. Im still hoping we can get someone like you over here in florida one day. no hate if it never happens but it would be nice. keep doing your thing and being awesome.
in case anyone is wondering  the main reason protein is so important to losing weight is due to 3 things.1. 30  of the calories you eat of protein is used to produce additional enzymes to digest the protein  in other words you only take in the other 70  of those calories compared to other foods.2. in order to build muscle you need three things  water  protein  and energy your workout . more muscles means more calories burned and more calories needed. so if you like to eat  focus on slowly building lean muscle so you can eat more.3. protein is very filling due to it taking longer to digest  so you are full longer  and dont eat as much.
at 70 the game changes for exercise. past few years taking a beta blocker and restricting exercise due to a miniscis tear played havac on my shape.  back in the gym with a trainer who knows weights and starting zone 2 cardio again. my goal is to do a sprint or olympic trI this september.
thank you for the dating advice cuz Im obv clueless.  I cant figure out what women want when the bar keeps rising.
never apologize for something you didn t do.
sure macros are important but calories in and out should come first as well as exercise. macros is just how you optimize it. then you optimize your type of training to dial in what youre trying to accomplish
love the ama. someday we ll get the conspiracy video s
to those who come here to complain about carnivore. it might not work for you. it does for me. my mother is freaking out about it and sending me doctor videos about the horrors of keto  but it is working for me. Ive dropped close to 50 pounds since melonie s video.
just to add some stuff here regarding fitness. lifting weights will use more calories in the long term than cardio  due to the raise in basal metabolic rate  more energy used to maintain muscle and do things . cardio usage of calories is a bit more instant by comparison  although you have diminishing returns on it. your body will adapt to forms of cardio  becoming more efficient and using less energy for the same effort. like lifting weights and progressive overload  you have to amp up cardio if you plan to have the same outcome of energy usage. as far as I recall  epoc has recently been a bit debunked on how potent it is as well. its best to view it this way instead  if you want to improve your cardio vascular system  go for it. otherwise  it can be a diet tool. if you need to lower calories  to cut for instance   you could use cardio and not adjust your food at all  or can do both  it depends . the outcome is still the same  calories would be dropped. cardio is a measurable tool  much like walking is  so it works great as a diet tool.
finally these are the questions Ive been for waiting for.
good Lordy  so showing progress of being fit and healthy is a problem for fools on inter webs    guys   all plumbing down there  screw anyone who doesnt want you to be healthy in body  mind  and soul. each of these requires different methods of training. be better and be good.as for yourself miss mac you are a great inspiration for anyone to be better.religious or not. keep up being awesome and good.I thank you for this. and pray that God blesses you in this.
we all miss your content. I hope you are doing well. I  look forward to your content when you choose to come back.  God bless you.
love the commentary melonie...keep it up!!!!!  ps always look for that dream guy...dont settle!!!
I am curious  what led you to into religion  are your family religious or did you come to itsome other way  it is interesting to hear your views  I would love to understand more. great videos  humility and a nice person are rare to be in the same person  and killer looks too! you rock girl!!!
my fat usually deposits in the area somewhere between my forehead and the soles of my feet.
that was a fun interesting watch. I really liked the part about the nephilim
Ive been dealing with pretty severe digestive issues and chronic phatgue for about 4 years now.Im always looking for real world no bs knowledge about diet.Im in pretty decent shape but I still have a little too much fat.
try intermittent fasting.  it actually does wonders for your energy.  more often than not  people get fatigued because their digestive system is constantly working overtime and sapping any energy they might have.
Im not religious at all but hearing the religious talk is a breath of fresh air lately.
good luck on your dating quest  melonie. I know its hard these days  people are so selfish. church might be the only place to find men of moral character  but even thats questionable as a lot of churches have fallen to woke ideology  so it really depends
a bit late  but as a note on working out. full body workouts will make your upper body more muscular than just upper body workouts  as they increase myofibrillar protein synthesis and suppress myostatin  a hormone that breaks down muscle into energy thats then stored as fat. so squats also make your shoulders bigger by virtue of making your muscles more receptive to growth.
try adding in swimming to reduce the impact on your knees  you can get the cardio while using more body muscle in general without beating up your joints.
I was with that alien rant towards the end  you were spittin
hI cardio is by far the most efficient training you can do. but you need a decent muscle mass for it to be really effective. at the end of the day just do what feels good for you. as long as you do something to stay healthy all is fine.
I know how you feel about dating. there so many people with high mileage. ive never heard that theory about aliens wanting to make nephylm. ive heard the demon theory though which I always thought was interesting.
lol the alien part made me laugh and scared at the same time .
hey melonie  I was wondering what you like to do other than playing video games  watching anime  and lifting weights  also  do you ever listen to collective soul  lifehouse or breaking benjamin p.s. - 100  right on having to be attracted to the person physically. I dont want to wake up next to an ogre  if you get my drift.
weight loss can get very complicated and yes we are all individuals but  eat less move more  is the maxim! everything else is just adaptation.
beef and shrimp !  uncle roger be like  fuiyoooh!
hay melonie I totally agree with you on the aliens and the nephilim stuff. Im actually really into those kinds of things.  but I think  given the vastness of God and the universe the idea of other life somewhere out there should not be dismissed  Im just saying that there are so many places and dimensions to this universe that we can not reach.
great video  melonie!
my pastor use to say big doors swings on small hinges. God rejoices in the little because he watches how we handle the little things that prepare us for the big things. God always watches how we handle the seeds he gives us to sow.
great content!
I always find q and as for women interesting because its mostly guys trying to slide into your dms. they always ask the proverbial   what do you look for in a guy   or  what s such and such that attracts you to a person   its them trying to size up whether or not they meet your standards. which  no offense  the person you are asking is not going to date you. so stop asking such trivial questions. the reality of the situation is  if you have to ask the question. youre not the one. not by a long shot. I do love the line of melonie saying Im incredibly single at the moment. made me chuckle.the rest of the questions were great. loved the answers to them.
the carnivore diet is the bees knees. I did it a few years ago for a month  lost 40 lbs and my sciatic problems went away and still haven t come back
just putting it out there  you ain t the only one who thinks that about the  alien  situation.
as far as the wokelies  I defer to pharaoh rameses   let  them  rave on  that men shall know  them  mad!
you make me smile lol
according to the Bible the universe itself is a lot more contained and less  vast  than what we are taught
@melonie mac go boom  indeed I completely agree with you  but the universe is still extremely vast and thats an understatement! and I still believe that they is some kind of life that God created somewhere out there in the universe. and also I love you very much lovable melonie
I get what your saying but you gotta work the glutes for equal muscle strength. I have back issues due to not working my abs   ilosoaz I think my physical therapist said.keep it up girl! God bless
go boom  is my spirit animal!
genuinely I remember phil defranco  who I used to listen to  say that he talked a bunch of stupid junk at the beginning of his time on the internet.same.  usually to try to tell a stupid joke or be edgy.  but if you genuinely want to think and grow - I almost think its better to leave a trail of stupid on the internet.its like - yeah I grew.  did you
do you consider being an independent content creator as employment  I am not one of these  but am curious.
Im employed Im a Christian  was in the worship team  idk if that helps attractive I would say so Ive been going to the gym and working on my summer bod but Im a big foodie so the struggle is real love your channel keep up the great work
melanie starting about conspiracy theories about that aliens are demons and that the government wants us to reproduce with them. normal people  thats weird  your crazy.me  melanie  marry me.
if I could  I d do 8 hours a day of training. sadly  I exercise  but my diet is really bad. but I do love exercise.
yes ! single is good but your like me I would like to find the opposite I dont know what I am introvert   extrovert  but I consider myself as a sigma male not an alpha nor a beta male. im going to go check out some of your g fuel. ok have a blessed week. God bless you !
I try to eat more jerky as a snack and less peanuts. I dont know if I could go all meat-avore. harder to sculpt with exercise when you can only reveal a stick body underneath. so itstill a good idea to eat in a balance.
love the hair. looks good on you.
you had me at nephalim and fallen angels! can we get married already  I d love to have some deep conversations with you.
relating to biblical matters  are you acquainted with the works of dr michael heiser  the unseen realm and the naked Bible pocdast   makes you look at the Bible in a different way and gain a deeper appreciation for the literary contexts than we ve been accustomed to.
I eat 3000 calories...and Im not serious.  nice video!
extremely single  yo  I ll be your extrovert!  Im kidding. not that I wouldn t jump at the chance if I could... but Im happily married  loyal  and not into starting romance through the internet.... hell  my wife and I have both been fans of yours for years. but if I were to meet you face to face and I was single  completely different story. and she s here reading what Im writing and agreeing... youre a total smoke job  she said.  I ll use my hall pass for her  hun.  but I can joke lol. that was still legal last time I checked... barely  but still legal.
that alien stuff was cray  mel.  high af
preach  mel. you look great!
I agree with you about the alien topic. I believe in interdimensional entities  i.e. spirits  angels  demons . when you look at the book of genesis  many people ask  how could God wipe out most of mankind in the flood   - a simple gene pool issue  that otherwise would prevent eligibility of Christ from incarnating within humanity. itstill persisted after that  and also afterward  gen 6 4    and hints to later times as well  as the days of noah were  matt 24 37
please make a dedicated video on your demon aliens
we should do some gaming!
agreed on all counts.
extroverts are more hookup typeintroverts are more loyal type
wow as beautiful as you and single for two years  anyone you expressed interest in would feel like they had wonthe lottery! well  going on a few dates in that time is more dates than Ive ever been on    but I know you will find the right guy out there soon
so what your looking for is tom holland to be your nathan drake to your lara croft.
good for you bringing up the nephalim and the alien deception.thank you for standing with biblical truth in all of your talking points.I am praying for your continual growth in scriptural wisdom and to be strengthened by the helper as you stand for the Lord Jesus Christ.stand tall sister and put on the armor of the spirit everyday. eph 6 10-17 kjv
and I have to watch this tommorow  because my wifI is freaking out
I have a similar opinion about aliens. a lot of people ask why God would create an infinite universe that only has us in it  but I think the idea that the universe is infinite yet we re the only intelligent beings in it is profound. we re insignificant by scientific standards  but by God s standards  we re the only significant thing.
I love your content so much  beautiful girl  and beautiful hart  lovable melonie .
skinny shred go boom
everyone here trying to get in on mel s dating preferences
14 26 well that counts most of us out lol
sjws  we need to support female streamers no matter what.melonie  meat  classic lara croft  Jesus.sjws  wait  thats illegal.
hey melonie I just want to ask you why do you use the nlt version and other versions of the Bible instead of niv version of Bible  I just want to ask you that question  ok melonie. anyway hope you have a wonderful and great blessed evening and have a great weekend and have a good night too melonie.
my workout 3 days a week 30 min on the elliptical every workout to start then rotation 1 - cable cross over   barbell  squats  rotation 2 - butterfly  dumbbell press  dumbbell shoulder press  more squats. diet no soda or alcohol  anything else.
introverted does not mean does not take the reigns or is shy I and my wife are both introverts. more accurate  to say you would prefer alone  small groups to parties  feel drained from events with people youre not interested in. sounds more like you had no chemistry with those guys and think introversion is the problem.
mel  you gorgeous! ... and smart!!
squawking is a very dangerous exercise   so I am glad to hear that you dont do squawks or dont do it a lot   it is very bad on the knees  in other words it can and most likely will destroy a person s knees   sure there is  I am sure people who have done them and done them for sure over many years    and it didn t or have not hurt their knees . yes I eat a lot carbs   that is my vice no doubt lol . melonie you I hear say that you are around 35   well may I say I think you look like you are 25
hey melonie.you look healthy and fit as ever  and its good to see. but I really gotta say this for your own sake I am sorry but what you said about the glycogen stores thing... that really depends  but generally the way you described it.... thats not how it works. glycogen is a form of energy storage for your muscles. if you deplete your glycogen stores  you will burn fat yeah... but you will also increase cortisol and eventually burn protein as well  meaning you can actually lose muscle.especially during long and high intensity exercises. and the body does tap into your fat stores regardless of how much glycogen you have  when lifting weights.glycogen can actually allow you to increase your performance both during cardio and strength training. you dont need to deplete it in order to start burning fat.wherever youread that or heard it  its just not quite right.there are many studies out there  and many contradict eachother  and many are outright wrong.I think the reason why it has worked for you is because of strength training and your diet. because cardio is generally not the best for long term fat loss. but still the best for your heart  and even more so for your rib costal cartilage when youre starting to get old  as it can stiffens otherwise and gives you a stiff chest sensation when breathing. and in general because of improved blood circulation will allow you to not only recover faster between sets  but also your muscles in general during your rest days. but that is usual a type of cardio that gets your pulse up  not by simply walking slowly for a long time.studies often dont account to human behavior in general. as an instructor and personal trainer Ive seen hundrets of people through just the 2 years alone who has been struggling with cardio and not losing weight. because the body adapts much faster  about 2 weeks  to cardio compared to strength training. meaning you ll burn a hell of a lot less calories than what treadmills will tell you.and many people exchaust themselves during cardio  which increases their hunger and apatite  but they often have poor impulse control and ends up eating more than they burnt.this is usually because people are generally too self-indulgent and lack impulse control. or they exchaust themselves to the point that later their weight lifting routine suffers for it. meaning their performance drops  and so they wont be able to have that challanging routine as they otherwise would be able to handle. but that doesnt seem to be a problem for you. but I think its important to keep this in mind  especially since youre planning to cut.because you will get stronger  thus training harder  and if you keep going in this direction with this belief  then you might end up getting what you want  at the cost of getting problems with sleep and anxiety due to overly depleting your glycogen storage  which might also overly increase your cortisol levels  which will then contribute to issues with anxiety and sleep and overall mood.
well this  steady state cardio  you speak of wouldn t work for me since this is literally just my job. every day. 5-10 miles daily  easy just from work.  honestly I just need to cut out the junk food. the problem is that I live with my folks as my dad is disabled and my ma need the extra help  but she keeps buying so. much. fudging. junk food.
theologically  are you a member of a particular denomination or non-denominational
I used to use a stair masteruntil my lower back arthritis inflammed.
what if Im both loyal and a hook up type
@kingslayer  what if Im both alive and dead
@john connor  am I joe biden
its not just that  its that we can see pretty deep into space. we re able to observe hundreds of thousands of other planets and we have found nothing. its hard to imagine that we wouldn t have found at least evidence of something by now  if there were anything to find.
Imean especially as a Christian and a geek myself melanie is literally the perfect chick you know how hard that is to find in this day and age bro hardly any Christian s  hookup culture is rampant  drugs and alcohol is the go to etc. so its a struggle out here 30 years old and stopped hooking up for 6 months so far.
I guess I ll out myself  I dig the confidence. too many girls trying to do the feel sorry for me bit. I also appreciate the unwavering faith she has  Im catholic an yea I get every stereotype joke that brings. but hear me out  I never felt comfortable in the church not for any reason in particular except that you get looked down upon for not worshipping within the walls of the church. Ive always felt that no matter where I prayed or bowed my head so long as my prayer was truthful somebody was listening. there is a bit of elitism I felt there that always bothered me. I guess my expression has always been I have my own relationship with our maker
the more muscle you have the more calories you can burn. every pound of muscle you have burns 50-100 calories while resting.
yeah watch those knees.  it catches up to you when you get older.  no pain no gain dont apply to joints.
melonie mac is single!  where can I sign up for a interview xp joking
you want glutes deadlift or rdl - will never get out of proportion like anything else it ll just get strong - its important for the chain.edit a calorie is a calorie provided you are meeting your needs - losing water and glycogen weight does not equal losing fat - there is a very slight thermic effect of protein otherwise calories are calories. there haven t been hundreds of years of people getting shreeded on other diets for no reason.
yeah steady burn s the way to go.
while I dont personally subscribe to your view on aliens  was cool hearing someone talk about nephilim from old testament.
the family.  we were a strange little band of characters trudging through life sharing diseases and toothpaste  coveting one another s desserts  hiding shampoo  borrowing money  locking each other out of our rooms  inflicting pain and kissing to heal it in the same instant  loving  laughing  defending  and trying to figure out the common thread that bound us all together.   erma bombeck   I love my family!
when she says be a Christian I am done hahahha  Im a Christian myself  no wonder she s so bias  people dont share your body  thats why people are so different
your whole lack of interest in items is more of a Christian thing cuz we know the real value is in the world we are taken too in the next life  and things in this world aren t that important
well Im surprised she didn t picked my question about tomb raider worst to best
mel  you should check out a book called  childhood s end   its an old scifI novel about demon-aliens infiltrating human society from the top-down over about a hundred years  eventually  modifying  human children so they ll develop all sorts of weird powers. it was written by the engineer that made the first comm satellite  and came out in the 1950 s  before we even knew what dna was . fascinating and disquieting read  one that makes me wonder if the author was privy to some information that we re not.
I completely agree with your assessment of aliens and the nephilim.  itseems we follow the same people and have a very similar philosophy about the world around us as it pertains to biblical creation.
where d you go  Imiss you so  seems like its been forever  that you ve been gone.
you dont train your butt  because its your fat deposit  training your glutes wont make you lose weight on your glutes faster. there is no targeted weightloss. there is however  targeted muscle growth. so if you want to counter the skinny  you need to train those glutes.or Im just misunderstanding.
someone who s employed  so sad you even have to mention that
interesting take on aliens. I always told people aliens  extraterrestrials  dont conflict with God s word at all. many angels are extraterrestrial. I only disagree with that rational you have for the noexistence of aliens  because  my Bible tells me the heavens and the earth and all in them were made for Christ. we get to share in them with him. we aren t the center of the universe  we are the apple of his eye.I dont want to limit God by saying we are the extent of his creative ability. specially when we dont actually know what s out there.last  dont worry about people thinking people you sound crazy... we already believe man raised from the dead  pierced a rock without breaking it and sailed off into the blue  so people will already think we are in left field. anyway  cool video.boooom!
25 03 to 25 45 excuse me  uh I think you just had your  or just gave your audience their I chose the wrong day to quitsniffing glue moment here lol like did you ever just think that their maybe science fiction fans  and thatscience fiction  such as star trek and the orville  which is what that jalogia thing is referencing  helps bring people into nasa and the study of space in generalwhich aint exactly a bad thing given the kind of space trash we got floating up there  and how asteroids have impacted the earth over the years  as their findings might give us more time to I dont knowsend a rocket up to adjust the course of an asteriod or a meteor that may impact like the one in russia did back in the early 1900 s in tunguskaor give people enough time to duck and cover from the chelyabinsk meteor  which only happened 9 years ago in russia yet again  like I get that your worried about scientoligists lady  but Jesus lay off glue lol
youre a smart lady.
on the notion of aliens  the Bible does explicitly say that there are other worlds besides earth. I dont believe we will ever actually have  alien  encounters  but I do believe they exist.also worth noting about  nephilim   that passage is highly misunderstood. the terms  sons of God  does not refer to angels in genesis 6. there are times in scripture when that phrase has been used to describe angels  but it is also used to describe the leaders of other worlds as per the book of job  and significantly more often it is used to describe humans who follow God s will. the sons of God and the daughters of man were both humans. it was a reference to the two offshoots of humanity  one line from seth  the  sons of God  who were holy and revered God  and the  daughters of men  who were the secular children of cain. angels do not have the ability to reproduce. that is one of the unique features of humanity when it comes to sentient races. the Bible explicitly states that once we go to heaven at the 2nd coming  there is no more marriage  and therefore no more child bearing  mark 12 25  matthew 22 30 . that is why he says we will  be like the angels . because we will no longer reproduce.the word  nephilim  in genesis just means  giant . it has no supernatural connotation whatsoever. adam is believed to  have been nearly 14 feet tall  and eve at around 12 feet. the  nephilim  were very large humans due to a  not having devolved as much yet because they were earlier in the line  and b  genetic vitality from interbreeding with cain s line and seth s line.now  thatsaid  you are 100  right thatsatan uses demons to deceive people. in fact  every single time a person has  spoken with the dead  it has been a demon  not a person that they were speaking to. the Bible states explicitly that the dead cannot communicate with the living. because they are dead.  for the living know that they shall die  but the dead know not anything. -ecclesiastes 9 5

haha  touch ! perhaps what motivates such posting is what I would really like to know... shabbat shalom
Im very skeptical  but if multiple sources say we were given things like art  math  writing etc.Im inclined to think there s some truth behind the legend myth.maybe theg weren t Gods like some believe  or aliens like others say...maybe they were former survivors from previous global disasters  the few who were in orbit  or underground in secured places when the land slid around like crazy.but again  there s just no comprehensive outline I know of that puts every ancient society into the 6k years of the  biblical timeline .but again  we still dont know everything. if time dilation works like theorized  space-faring men could leave and come back  only spending months or years away  and return to find its been centuries here. Im certain we dont have all the answers  and I doubt we ll actually get them.
out for the weekend  wtf is this. there is no time off youtube.
it can mean that but if someone is mad at you that doesnt nessaserly mean youre doing something right if I slap you in the face you wil get mad at me that doesnt mean am doing something right if someone gets mad at you you canthink about it and see if they are right or not and if you dont know you can do some research or soulsearching to find the answer.to automaticly assume youre right and they are wrong is abit egocentric I dont think you mean it like that but the way you said it made you look abitselfrightious like youre always right and other are always wrong.
the nephilim 100  are out there imo  and look at all the old stories about giants they all eat ppl  devil worshippers eat human flesh and so do demons and such  idk I think it is  Christian here btw.
09 50 120 lbs  come here little girl  I will bench press you many times. hahahahaha
dating is a lost cause  been single for 10 years now. american women are mostly crazy and way to high maintenance. seems like they are always looking for the upgrade or rich guy. dont do squats  normal guys like a booty.
youre Christian but the Bible is clearly against tattoos

not its not  youre just parroting nonsense pushed by hardliners.
@the marauder  oh I thought the Bible was your holy book  which clearly states in leviticus 19 28   you shall not make gashes in your flesh for the dead  or incise any marks on yourselves . also  in the new testament  1 timothy 2 9  nlt   and I want women to be modest in their appearance. they should wear decent and appropriate clothing and not draw attention to themselves by the way they fix their hair or by wearing gold or pearls or expensive clothes.   which is clearly not what melanie does. true Christians do not have tattoos  then you can be a part time Christian that applies the parts that are congenial to you. but would be hypocritical to point the fingers against others that apply what they like.
@the marauder  the only nonsense that Ive heard here is when melanie talked about aliens  which sounded very qanon.
@federico sanna    Im not a Christian  so its not my book. also  leviticus doesnt apply to tattoos as youre not cutting into yourself.
@the marauder  different translations talk about marks on the skin  not only incisions  even though to have a tattoo you gotta pierce your skin . Im not Christian either although my family is  but apparently she is too
@federico sanna  everyone misinterprets it and twists the words to fit their views. I had to study it as part of religious education at school. its a bunch of nonsense  it was written by men to control man and its full of contradictions.
