I loved how her character arc was learning nothing and everyone else was wrong but her. truly a breathtaking vision for the series
jen   these storylines dont make any sense!!! the audience   wait .. there was a storyline !
the best ending would be if the critical drinker showed up  defeated she-hulk  then looked at the screen and said   okay  go away now.
I love how the writers thought it was cool and clever that jen literally looks at the audience and admits that her own show is shit and makes no sense and is trash and the writers straight up know it. we truly are the suckers  though because we watched it. but I couldn t help myself this show and watching it was like watching a train wreck of such insane levels you cant look away. I have never seen a series that had such a big budget be so bad. like I cant believe how bad it really was. it is like a fever dream.
the whole season I was supportive of it but this finale made me realize I was wrong and I feel stupid.
I liked the part when monica rambeau appeared and said  they ll never know what you sacrificed for them  she-hulk.  and flew away.
I demand to speak to the manager! thats the climax the series built to.
the sad part is  the writers probably thinks its a success because they know they pissed off a lot of fans.
Ive literally never rage quit a show before  but this finale broke me. I tried watching last night and turned my tv off about halfway through and had to finish it this morning. truly abysmal
on the other hand jennifer does seem like the character who instead of taking a deep introspective look at herself and if she was part of the problem would just go complain to the manager.
the writers literally self inserted themselves into the show  and not the several times they gave themselves cameos like at the awards show
I remember when I was in high school and my english teachers would tell the class that if we were to end our storyline in a way that these writers have we would get an f on our assignment. when I look at the quality of what passes for writing in these shows all I think about is how I would have failed if I did that exact same thing in class.
that beginning made me realize that there will never  ever  be a better live action hulk show  than bill bixby s incredible hulk.
her character  arc  was a literal straight line from being insufferable to being insufferable  but with super powers.
she was supposed to be the prosecutor and make people take accountability for their actions but instead they made her a terrible attorney and doesnt know how things actually work.
this should have been called an epilogue for a narcissist.I love your reviews! keep up the great work
she-hulk didn t deserve this mess  she could have had an amazing show in the right hands...but that aside omg your ripley outfit is fking amazing!
I would ve been utterly annoyed by wasting my time watching this series lmao. thank you for your sacrifice
this is probably the worst finale  I have ever seen in my life.
this is greatest show Ive never seen.  the amount of comedic content derived from it on youtube has been wonderful.  marvel and disney  s descent has been a glorious avalanche of a gift that keeps on giving.  good stories give way to  the message
pretty much reflects everyone working at disney.
Im kind of happy they kept at least pug as a good dude the entire series.  the only man they didn t trash somehow.
@bryan woods  yeah except hulk  daredevil  wong  jens dad and brother  the dude she went out with during waited 4
@lewis baldwin  hulk was a mansplainer  her dad was either effeminate or too overprotective  the only good date was a  nice guy  for not wanting jen.  daredevil was okay.
@bryan woods  daredevil liked she hulk thats his sin.
@bryan woods   hulk was a mansplainer.  oh sorry that hulk tried to help his own family with something that only he in the entire world has gone through for 15 years. biggest mistake he ever made obviously. he should have just let jen discover she was a hulk during her own rage moment which could have landed her jail time and possibly may have even lead to death to civilians all because he mansplained.
@bryan woods  how was hulk a  mansplainer
this whole show was a self insert fic  for the miserable writers
@bryan woods  oh wait I take it back  I realize now you were pointing out the flaws the writers made. Im humbled

wait... there was an audience
even jen thought it was bad
and then make it even worse
they cant say a lot of stuff about her story line cause its connect to the world breaker hulk movie thats  about to come out so if they tell to much before the world breaker hulk movie come out   we wont get another hulk movie which is going to probably  show the red she-hulk and the red hulk not in less they show the on she-hulk season two  but like  said if they do that then we wont get another hulk movie you fools
@tnskipper  the show sucked.
glad you didn t watch the show or pay attention.
@sirio  so  what did she learn  how did she grow as a character  I watched up to ep 4-5... which ever one ended with hollywood from mannequin showing that he is making daredevil s suit... I had enough. I could just hear johnny storm shouting  flame on!
but its a comedey!!! and not a very good one
@bryan woods  hulk wasn t a mansplainer  the others you are right about but not hulk because they were literally two people on the planet who understand what its like to have to deal with being a  monster  because of gamma radiation  hulk and abomination. hulk understands more about what thats like than abombination does as he dealt with it longer. if you know the story of bruce banner before he became the hulk then you would call jen a b  @  for how she treated him. getting catcalled isn t as bad as having your mom murdered in front of you by your dad as a child nor is being forced to become a freak that is hunted by the government and cant even commitsuicide because of it.
still waiting for someone to list anything she did wrong.
perfect reflection of the producers mindset.
@anthony chase  its not about whether hulk was right or not.  the show presented him as mansplaining being a hulk.
@anthony chase  he s talking about the narrative the show is trying to present  not his own opinion. the show awkwardly tries to portray bruce banner as an icky mansplainer even though he s 150  in the right to worry about jen becoming an unstoppable ragemonster. its perfectly reasonable for him to expect jen s hulk form to be similar to his own  he couldn t have known the show was written by a bunch of shrews who think having a vagina is a superpower.
@sirio  glad you couldn t see the bland to non-existent character development and accuse us of turning our brains off simply because we want better. jennifer had no development in the series at all. everything is handed to her and she learns nothing from her mistakes. end of story.
@jonathan baker  exactly. I hate these toxic she-hulk defenders.
@aliradicali  okay gotcha  that makes more sense now. thanks for clearing that up.
@gabeseditz  you sound just like the intelligencia lmao.but no  she did develop as a character  from not wanting to be a superhero to eventually slowly over the episodes realizing that being she-hulk is amazing.she literally breaks the 4th wall to say this.  again more proof that you didn t pay attention wtf does she have handed to her  please tell me anything she gets handed to her thatshe doesnt deserve.
her lawyer told her like it was
I love everyone just literally ignoring the scene where its pretty clearly stated thatshe s been arrested and cant become she hulk anymore  because she didn t listen to bruce  and she is deeply upset about that. what  are you so bad at media comprehension that you cant understand the incredibly simple arc they gave her unless they literally spell it out for you
@jonathan baker  youre literally admitting you didn t watch the show. if you watch the entire show  its made exceedingly obvious that her dismissing bruce is a character flaw that directly leads to most of her problems throughout the series. the scene where mallory tells her she s not a normal person is the culmination of that realization. but oops you didn t watch the fucking show so you didn t see that part.
@bryan woods  I can see both sides of it. the way he went about trying to teach her wasn t great and yeah it could definitely be considered mansplaining but at the exact same time  I dont think it can because the topic isn t something that just any random person can understand  there s two people alive who do and on top of that  bruce is trying to help his cousin in the only way that he knows how which is by testing her powers and seeing whether or not she is capable of  doing something more with them. yes he was kind of dumb to assume thatshe wanted to be a superhero like him and thatshe wanted to give up her life to do so  but she also didn t know anything that he has had to learn by doing so. the story department clearly didn t know what the hell that they were trying to write because this feels like some  woman empowerment  piece which I am all for  but not when that is your entire plot.
yawn how many of these  fake controversy  channels are out there on youtube
@mustang65  what donyou mean by that
@sirio  oh wonderful. congrats on giving her the bare minimum of development with  one episode left in series. and its not as if jennifer is some saint. she s a rude  selfish  egotistical narcissist who constantly looks down on others and thinks she s better than everyone. and just because she addressed the supposed audience thats praising her does not mean she s learned anything. and what are you talking about  what s handed to her   she somehow gets nominated for female lawyer of the year despite several other women getting nominations  which in reality is insulting to women and their worth   great job writers  and the fact she committed terrible legal practices. Im no lawyer  but something tells me at least 90  of what jennifer does in the show is highly unethical. next time you want to argue  do your research. the intelligencia are merely a joke written by the writers because they knew the show was shit and were going to have to deal with criticism. and guess what  they couldn t even do that. pathetic if you ask me.
and its sad because I thought there would be some serious consequences after she hulked out and I believed she would have a arch of realization like . wow is this a hat bruce felt   I thought she would gain more self confidence as well  but no! this show has no plot  no arching story  nothing!
@something right  she suffered consequences for a very brief period of time before breaking into the 4th wall  way to far for any show. they literally talked about the shows budget in the finally. skrew you. back on topic  in her 64th wall break she talks to a fucking marvel aI writer to get rid of her consequences. and she decides what character s will do. treats a man like a play thing  which women always say they hate when the shoes on the other foot  and she did this thing she would hate done to her bc she  has her needs  so all of jen s bad choices. collimates to her  rewriting the show  inside of the show  where she removes the blood story line  implying the josh storyline is gone  and there is no main villain. she just sues the online trolls  who would have attacked her  in essentially a different time line since jen got to just  re write their incriminating actions. then she just deleted her cousin from the finally  instead of being in any way thankful  that her own family was willing to try to protect her  just had a  nah skrew him  he s a man who appeared to save me because Im weak women  attitude. not to mention. she just chooses what blansky  probably misspelt  will do. taking his free will so he does what she wants. she just decided other characters shouldn t be bad and picks for them. regardless of if someone else rescues him later. so jen just  talks to the marvel writers  removes half the story lines of the series inside of the climax of the finally. and takes away her few consequences  bc she s back to being a she hulk lawyer. and you say we re ignoring her consequences  gtfo
its a most like ya ll didnt watch the show at all
@marvelfan2012  its almost like youre making a pathetic attempt at defending this show by accusing us of not watching it  when in reality you have no actual defense.
and to think poor unfortunate souls had the faith and hope of little children believing in santa clause saying  give it a chance  the writers are going to make her learn from her mistakes  probably
ikr. I especially loved how it was so straight and flat it gave captain marvel s ass- Imean arc a run for its money. truly the best line of work for shapeless cardboard cutouts  bar none.
I think some characters should have a bad personality. even if its annoying its nice to have imo.
her cousin went from being a  mindless rage monster  to becoming a hero by sacrificing so much which is why people came to idolize and accept him and is the reason why she gets accepted by people so easily. its kind of fucked up imo.
the arc was all men are bad and shes perfect just like all critics who dislike the show are misogynists and the writers are the best ever...the fact people buy into the stupidity and the manipulation is awful
@uncharted horizon  you are fundamentally wrong about what happened. she didn t remove the blood storyline  she stopped todd literally becoming a hulk  because thats fucking stupid. she s going to come to face much larger consequences when season two happens and she realizes that her rewrite gave someone much more intimidating her blood. almost like there s more to the show and her arc is only about halfway done. she s realized she cant avoid being a hulk  now she needs to learn that hulks arent invincible
the whole series was her screwing up and realizing it. but  then again  the writers must have done crazy research on internet trolls because they were spot on from the beginning. shows that they see what you guys are saying about their movies and shows and dont care. lol
@gabeseditz  they didn t get nominated for female lawyer of the year. they all got female lawyer of the year. it was a participation award. that was the joke.
@jinxie712  it was a stupid joke  then. Im 99  certain that would never happen in real life. hell  it wouldn t happen in the mcu of places if it weren t for the writers of she-hulk.
@gabeseditz  it kinda does happen in real life. just because you dont want it to be true doesnt mean it doesnt.
@jinxie712  how does this happen in real life  there is absolutely no female lawyer that Ive ever seen disrespected in the way every single one of those women on stage were. in fact  the best ones are quite respected. just look at camille vasquez from the johnny depp vs amber heard trial. everyone loves and respects her.
@gabeseditz  they did not give her the bare minimum of development with one episode  again showing you didnt actually watch the show. they built her character over all 9 episodes.she went from hating the fact thatshe was getting pushed into being a hero  to embracing she-hulk.exactly like in the comics.this is an origin story what more do you expect when does she ever think she is better than anyone else  when is she ever rude to anyone  when is she ever egotistical or narcissistic  she-hulk is sometimes those things  but jennifer walters is never those things.
@gabeseditz  also I love how you try to virtue signal a point about how the show inadvertently made women look bad  but fail to miss why it did the exact opposite.when she receives  female lawyer of the year award  she does earn it  she literally was a top lawyer at her previous firm and was the one who got abomination his parole  which should be impossible seeing how he killed so many   but tell me again how she didn t earn it you also point out the fact that in the show  they give all the female lawyers an award.then proceed to say how  insulting  it is.that was the point. in thatscene when they call jen s name  and the call every other womans name she is confused.they literally meant for it to be like that. to show how when women are acknowledged for their accomplishments by companies  its seen as a participation trophy rather than actually acknowledging their efforts
@gabeseditz  you are being trolled bud.  anyone defending this show....ugh.
stunning and brave
@gabeseditz  do they  or is she seen as depp s cute lawyer. she was pretty much forgotten less than a month after.
@sirio  yes. the show makes women look bad. it portrays them as perfect and flawless when it reality they re just selfish people with selfish problems. you know what makes good characters  flaws and imperfection.guess what  that wasn t earned because she discovered the contrivance of an inhibitor chip for emil way too late in the trial. if inhibitor chips already existed in the mcu  why didn t she use that as her go-to defense  and why does abomination deserved to be released from prison. he rampaged through harlem and killed tons of innocents  and tried to kill bruce. he took thatserum willing  if youremember  which Im pretty sure you dont but thats besides the point. so I ask again  how is getting abomination off on parol and accomplishment  and let me ask you this  if this show is written by females for women  why do they portray them in such a condescending and negative way while using the most basic of stereotypes for their characters  nuance and subtlety are a thing. and half the struggles she-hulk goes through in the show aren t even an issue Ive seen in real life. not every guy in the workplace got there because of his status as a man  and not every guy you meet on the streets is a misogynistic asshole. you know what superhero movie did a better at portraying struggles some women go through in the workplace in only about 1 10 of the screen time  wonder woman. you know what show did a better job at showing the power men can have over women   including situations involving assault   in a much more compelling way  jessica jones. and from what Ive seen  literally not every single woman practicing law is treated the same and or disrespected all the time. ruth bader ginsburg. kamala harris. camille vasquez recently. all of those women work  in ruth s case  worked  rip   in the court system and are fairly well respected  and the only ones who hate on them are a small  insignificant minority that dont represent society as a whole. the writers just decided thats the way it is because they re unhappy with themselves and their lives.you she-hulk stand are getting unbearably annoying. maybe thanos was right.
@brandon harris  they re annoying  man. they re like swarms that just keep on coming.
@jinxie712  I listed more examples in one of my other comments. go read that.
@jinxie712  I simply do not see your viewpoint about the whole series being about her screwing up and realizing it. it ended with a 4th wall break of her re writing herself out of all consequence. the point of realizing you screwed up is accepting consequences not running from them. she ended as she began  I see nothing else.
@gabeseditz  you listed what was wrong with her. I remember when people were upset that they started writing female characters as perfect. now when they have flaws you hate that the character has flaws which is it
@sirio  yes they did. throughout the whole series  jen is constantly hating the fact thatshe has superpowers and doesnt do anything with them other than act all high and mighty and treating everyone around her like shit. and its especially apparent with the male end of the spectrum.she s rude to every single guy she interacts with and thinks they re all out to get her. she believes she s right in  every situation without every considering that there are two sides to every story. for instance  she s upset at the oncologist guy for not liking jennifer walters when she s the one who made her dating profile as she-hulk and slept with him as she-hulk. she catfished the hell out of him and didn t give him any warning before hand  yet somehow we re supposed to feel as if he s the bad guy  she acts selfish and tells bruce she controls her anger infinitely more than him because she doesnt get angry when she s catcalled on the street and or when men explain stuff to her. 1  that doesnt make sense because she seems pretty incompetent at her job anyways. and 2  jennifer has not had a harder life than bruce in the slightest. that man was hunted by the military  treated like a dog  and subjected to years of torment and guilt for causing the deaths of countless innocents because there was a monster inside him he couldn t control. it took him years to learn to control his anger at the world and at himself. on top of that  he s had to grieve the loss of some of his closest friends and his love interest. but somehow jennifer controls her anger more because of some simple catcalling and  mansplaining.  that is bullshit.I could give other example  but I feel like Ive made my point to all the other non-biased mcu fans.
@jinxie712  what are you even talking about  the reason we hate those characters is because their perfect. they dont struggle or earn anything and they always have the worst personalities. captain marvel for instance. plenty of other female characters have flaws and are nuanced humans. ellen ripley  sarah connor  ashoka tano  kim wexler  etc..
@marshall  she realized that bruce was right in the 8th episode because everyone saw her as the monster.  everything she did from the moment she got back home after she became a hulk was wrong and was used against her easily. she and nikkI independently solved the problem before she rewrote the ending. all she did was take out the blood plot line  changed the time  and took out bruce. new ending just had her call the police after todd confessed to everything.
@gabeseditz  its funny that in an earlier comment you list a bunch of her flaws then in another say that all the women in the series was perfect with no flaws. which is it  and I didn t even see the one where you say they have no flaws when Imade my previous comment about people getting upset that women have no flaws in these movies shows. I think you intelligencia people are just hating just to hate. lol youre saying random stuff now.
@jinxie712  you clearly didn t read my comment. I said that the women were portrayed as perfect to the audience  but when you look closer yourealize they re just very selfish. the writers are trying to make jennifer look like the second coming of Christ to a bunch of wine mom s  but she s just not a good person.and oh boy  here we go. another person ignoring criticism by accusing others of being haters  all women  when all we want is a good story and characters. such a pleasant sight to see on the internet.  not .
@gabeseditz  didn t you make a comment about her being egotistical and a narcissist and to her everyone else is wrong and blah blah blah. make up your mind. is she perfect or not  ellen ripley was written as a dude until they made her into a mother in aliens. sarah connor was turned into a dude in the sequel. everyone hated ahsoka for most of clone wars. dont know who kim wexler is. captain marvel was supposed to have a bad personality. it was in the movie that they were trying to take away her emotions and change her personality to a different person. I dont think anybody got that because you guys were too busy hating larson.
if nothing else its a stunning allegory for disney themselves.
@gabeseditz  not one woman in thatshow was portrayed as perfect. everyone in the law firm hated jen except pug and nikki. mallory had to warm up to her. and mallory was the biggest snob. titania was a kim kardashian wannabe with busted teeth. jen s mom was super oblivious. madisynn was a drunk party girl. then you have the women at the wedding. where is the women that was portrayed as perfect  dude  do you not realize that this show was making fun of you  you guys are todd.
@jinxie712  ok  I ll explain it for you in a way you can understand. jennifer walters is a character that is portrayed as perfect and blames everything on the male ego  when in reality she s someone who s only in it for herself and blames her own issues onto other people. and why are you saying ellen and sarah are written as men  because they re written as humans with logical fears and flaws just like the rest of us  the writers just put in more effort. also it doesnt matter if ashoka was hated at first  what matters is thatshe s now one of the best characters in star wars. kim wexler is from a show called better call saul   a show infinitely better than she-hulk  btw   and nope. even when she wasn t being manipulated  carol was just annoying and egotistical  thinking she s better than everyone else. why do you think she had such a cocky attitude going up against thanos  he then proceeded to pimp slap her into oblivion. and in all honesty  I dont care for brie larson. Im only talking about carol danvers.
@jinxie712  mallory was the only character that had any conflict with jen. everyone else in the firm was written to hate her blindly without any sort of reason to. jennifer and the females are always portrayed as the victims and never as the perpetrators of their own mistakes. yourealize how problematic it is for a character to be treated as better than everyone else and have a victim complex  right
@jinxie712  I didn t see it that way but ok. Im glad someone enjoyed the series
@marshall  I honestly dont see how anyone can enjoy this series  but Im getting tired of discussing  so Im probably going to leave this thread after awhile.
@marshall  quite a bit did. I think the people that didn t enjoy it act exactly like intelligencia and the other net comments they kept putting up during the season. y know the people they were making fun of.
@gabeseditz  I had one that would not stop about game of thrones finale being  objectively good
@brandon harris  oh man  thats hopeless lol.
@brandon harris  oh my God. Jesus Christ. I ll admitsomething  though  everything about the got finale was perfect  except the writing  so nothing else mattered. she-hulk has numerous problems that extend beyond the writing. at the very least got had good cinematography  visuals  and an amazing score by the forever amazing ramin djawadi. she-hulk s cgI is crap and the visuals are lazy as hell.
I think they admit they re shit writers and actors. thats why they have to  change it . I hope they change the entire writing and producing staff.
dont forget she hulk worse enemy is.....online trolls...wow....it couldn t get worse
@zilla apollo  even f cking malekith was a better villain than the  intelligencia.
@gabeseditz  idk what youre talking about. I am a normal person with a life and a brain. I did not watch she hulk. just scoped the clips.
@zilla apollo  w. respect.
@zilla apollo  well played  I feel a need to watch all of the mcu because thats just how I am. I dont blame you for your approach
hey I saw this on angry joe
@truekingr6  Imade the same comment twice xd Im glad you noticed  thats cool to me. Im sorry for my unoriginal nature.
@marshall  I was literally just checking that video and I was like ey its the same guy! haha heck yeah spreading the good word
@bryan woods  he was a better lawyer than jena and we literally barely saw him in court.
fact its not my bad writing its kevin
@jinxie712   its funny that in an earlier comment you list a bunch of her flaws then in another say that all the women in the series was perfect with no flaws. which is it  it would be more accurate to say the writers refuse to concede their protagonist s flaws when actually she s a rolling fuggin  fuck-up. perfect example  the daredevil episode where the first thing she did on turning up was made the situation far worse  caused hundreds of thousands in property damage  threw someone else s car at a total stranger and allowed a kidnapper to escape  then conceded she has a lot to learn about the superhero business. ...no  wait  sorry  she blames him for the assumptions she made about his outfit. and he stands there like a doofus and says  fair point.  what... and I cant stress this enough... the fuck  swap daredevil out for blade and have her saying  well  excuse me for thinking you were trying to steal his car   see how far that flies. then later on they re arguing about the stealth approach getting into the frog s den or whatever   once again  the veteran points out they re armed and what is the new girl s reply   so what  Im bulletproof.   ... yes  jen... but daredevil  the hostage and everyone else in that building isn t  you self-absorbed trollop. so you were willing to charge in there and litter the floor with friendly fire corpses  possibly including the guy youre trying to rescue  nice work  shero  would ve made for some great headlines. thank Christ daredevil was there to throw a leash on you. you know what  hulk king did nothing wrong. she didn t earn those powers and she doesnt even remotely deserve them.
troof. there is no conflict  no stumbling and picking herself up  no loss  no growth  no character arc. canon she-hulk lost her best friend early on to the guy trying to kill her  which is what I thought wal-mart fran drescher s purpose was  but no. nothing happens. for nine episodes. then when they finally set up a big fight  which  let s face it  would ve been dreadful anyway given their record with action scenes   they literally stop the film  have the protagonist rewrite the ending and demand characters are punished for actions she knows full well were contrived in a writer s room and forced upon them.   Im not really a she-hulk stan so I did not have high hopes for this show from the jump. I would never have dreamed of the absolute downhill rolling shithouse fire it became  though. its a shame because she-hulk is a character fans have been waiting to see in live-action for decades  and this show could ve pushed her up into the a-list  netflix did it for daredevil  if they hadn t ffffucked it as spectacularly up as Ive ever seen anything fucked.
incidentally  the almost existential lack of self awareness of a staff of feminist writers raggin  on superheroes for having  daddy issues  is.... thats probably the biggest laugh I got out of the whole show.
@the mighty fiction  or its you. the entire series is her screwing up. she s a bulldozer and she knows it. thats the problem. she knows it. you say the writers never call her out  they did with daredevil in the same scene you mentioned about her going in there because she is invulnerable. she has never done any of that before and daredevil tells her that. in every situation  she was attacked 1st or there was an invasion  helped wong . titania taking her name was a growth moment for her. she wanted nothing to do with being she-hulk until it was taken from her and she realized it was her identity now. through the series she realized she made a mistake in taking bruce s help as she kept calling him for that help. intelligencia dropping everything on her was like a bomb being dropped on her thatshe was in over her head. that nothing she did was right up to that point and thatshe had to fix it. Im getting the feeling that you guys actually ignored what was happening in the show.how do you earn accidental powers  thats like saying a mutant doesnt deserve their powers because they didn t earn them. bruce didn t earn his powers. it was an accident when he experimented on himself. what about bucky  rhodey didn t earn his suit. wanda didn t earn her powers. vision didn t earn his powers. Imean  you dont see the irony of todd telling jen she stole the powers after he said he stole the powers from her. he said he wasn t handed the powers as someone is handing him the powers.
@jinxie712  or its you.  its not me. the entire series is her screwing up. and walking away from it  which is my point. she s a bulldozer and she knows it. thats the problem. she knows it. I know that is floor to ceiling horseshit. she has learned absolutely nothing and changed in no way whatsoever over the course of nine episodes. apparently  she had cosmic level reality-breaking superpowers anyway.  you say the writers never call her out  did I stutter  they did with daredevil in the same scene you mentioned about her going in there because she is invulnerable. she has never done any of that before and daredevil tells her that. yes  daredevil  daresplains  and what does she do  ignores him  crashes in on top of a mob of goons  fucks the stealth option to the moon and forces him to go to plan b. then she argues with him over who was the sidekick.in every situation  she was attacked 1st... exactly. shit happens around her. she s not remotely proactive.  ...or there was an invasion  helped wong . while simultaneously bitching about her date being interrupted. which  fair enough  could ve been funny. wasn t  though.  titania taking her name was a growth moment for her. she wanted nothing to do with being she-hulk until it was taken from her and she realized it was her identity now. no  she doesnt even notice until she has a lawsuit filed against her for taking the name titania was using  nonsensically  to shill stinkwater. this is not even remotely a moment of growth. through the series she realized she made a mistake in taking bruce s help as she kept calling him for that help. yes  the show has relied heavily on half-assed cameos. intelligencia dropping everything on her was like a bomb being dropped on her thatshe was in over her head. that nothing she did was right up to that point and thatshe had to fix it. which she did by demanding to speak to the manager.  Im getting the feeling that you guys actually ignored what was happening in the show. doing my best. how do you earn accidental powers  ask spider-man. he went off the rails with them at first and learned responsibility the hard way.  tony stark  irresponsible jag-off and borderline drunk until he saw the consequences of taking his eye off the ball and allowing his weapons to be traded behind his back. thor  arrogant warhawking prick who needed to be stripped of his powers and cast down to earth to learn the virtue of humility and sacrifice. this is not a new story. this is a hero s journey.    thats like saying a mutant doesnt deserve their powers because they didn t earn them. its not even remotely like that. youre comparing apples to oranges  a curse to a gift. cyclops  for example  has to practice responsibility every single moment of his life lest he accidentally slaughter people in their hundreds. rogue can never touch anyone without pitching them into seizures.   on the other hand   you have magneto  a mutant supremacist who thinks humanity is a relic that needs to  be discarded.  mutancy is simply a device that grants powers to heroes and villains alike for storytelling purposes  like the demi-Gods and -Goddesses of mythology.bruce didn t earn his powers. yes  he did. his condition began as a curse he tried to escape  even by taking his own life. it was only through the avengers he was able to harness its potential.  it was an accident when he experimented on himself. not that clear in the mcu what actually happened there. Im inclined to believe the official story in-universe is a military smokescreen. what about bucky  what about him  he was abducted  experimented on  used as a manchurian candidate for decades and went on a path of earning atonement for his crimes. rhodey didn t earn his suit. he was already a decorated soldier and was given it by a friend who trusted him. wanda didn t earn her powers. villain on a path to redemption  and apparently  back again. why do you keep comparing she-hulk to villains   vision didn t earn his powers. an artificial lifeform created in response to an imminent threat. you might as well say robocop didn t earn his powers. Imean  you dont see the irony of todd telling jen she stole the powers after he said he stole the powers from her.I see the intent of the irony  yes   its hard to miss  .  he didn t earn the powers either and got them pretty much the same way  which is a little odd  I thought thatshit was toxic to people outside the banner bloodline. does this mean cameo stan lee in tih became a hulk after he drank that janky soda  .  he said he wasn t handed the powers as someone is handing him the powers. ok  yeah. he didn t earn them either. did you expect me to defend the shitty writing of a critic insert when the show itself acknowledges that these actions were contrived for him and then unwrote them  this is the point. when youre handing out powers like fucking halloween candy  either youre telling a story about how only special people should have those powers and the chaos that results when they re available on tap  or there is no place for destiny  anyone who found that amulet or got struck by that magic lightning would ve done the job and those powers are no longer special.
@the mighty fiction  dude  Im not reading your book.
an accurate description of the  modern woman.
@something right  and then literally minutes later she s back and able to transform again. she learned nothing at all.
@darkstalkerknight63  disparu has a list.
her character arc was becoming a true karen
reminds me of captain marvel
@I am sam32  in episode 1 she was captain marvel times infinity its like they give almost every female character in marvel her personality.
@kaoskronostyche  these feminist shows like she hulk  captain marvel  birds of prey and supergirl reflect how toxic feminism is now and how its hijacked the superhero genre.
@I am sam32  a movie that broke records and yet the trolls were still crying
@jinxie712  wrong  wrong 100  wrong  the show since episode 1 has been on her side and never calling her out or holding her responsible  if she was she would change and become better she wouldn t go on a rant about sexism she would be quiet and listen to hulk s advice because it could help her be a better person and to learn to be a better hulk  this entire show was about her being mediocre but none of the characters call her out for it  instead she gots rewarded for her toxic behavior over and over   even gets the ending she wants no self sacrifice no accountability no heroism at all.
@arthas30000  speaking to the universes manager.
@mustang65  what do you mean
@uncharted horizon  wow I really despise jenn.
@jinxie712  she has 0 consequences dude  she had her ending given to her there s no accountability or sacrifice she endures.
@elongated man forever  waiting for you to say something base in facts.  all I see is you being toxic
@jinxie712  she never takes accountability dude never does.
@jinxie712  it does because of intersectional feminism which has killed the superhero genre.
@darkstalkerknight63  Im toxic because I tell the truth about feminist walter s shitty personality   can she ever be wrong
@elongated man forever  exactly xd
@darkstalkerknight63  if it means calling out toxic femininity from she hulk and hollywood I ll be toxic af Im loving it.
@elongated man forever  nothing about her behavior was toxic or anything you said at all.
@darkstalkerknight63  and had no character development at the same time
@I am sam32  both of them had tons of character development. one was dealing with the life she lost and the other was learning accepting herself and the changes that happened in her life
@elongated man forever  nothing any she-hulk was toxic. all you are is toxic because you are being called out for what you have done or seen and didn t stopped
@elongated man forever  nothing you said was base in facts and I know you cant list 1 bad thing about her personality because she was being any actual person.
@elongated man forever  she never takes accountability dude never does.worse than that  she demands accountability for characters whose actions she knows for a certainty were contrived for them in a writer s room. its like your girlfriend getting pissed at you after dreaming you slept with her best friend.
@darkstalkerknight63  no they didn t have any development stop lying and shilling  the show is about how bad men are and how women are always right stop writing character development that these 1 dimensional characters didn t earn.
@darkstalkerknight63  revealing backstory is not development when you start the movie as a cocky girl failing in a man s world and end the movie as a cocky girl that got ridiculously lucky with super powers and can now dominate the man s world even when men try and hold her back because thats all they do the whole movie and with she hulk  she does not learn to accept herself bruh. she routinely refuses to accept responsibility for her actions and blames the toxic men she allows freely into her life and personal space  speaking of she also has extreme prejudice toward all men who aren t hunks thatshe meets at the bar. in the end once again refusing to accept what s come of the things she chose to do she uses her awkward fourth wall break power to throw a tantrum until the robot kevin fiege gives her show a more favorable ending. I see no development  I see only writers that think being yourself unapologetically and without consequence is a feasible reality. the truth of the matter is you have to accept mistakes when you make them and not blame other people  and you have to learn to be smarter about stuff in the future so you dont make the same mistake again  because in real life you dont have show writers that you can ask to fix your life  or super powers that give you the ability to climb your hurdles. you have to do it yourself
@elongated man forever  they literally had tons of development. stop lying and being a hater.the show was how to deal worth a major change in life and accepting what happened.  they were all multidimensional characters.
@darkstalkerknight63  no the show was how to no take responsibility and how men are all bad.
@elongated man forever  nothing in the show was about that at all
@darkstalkerknight63  yes it was  did you not watch itor are you just a shill
@I am sam32  what.  she wasn t cocky at all. she worked hard for 6 years if training to get where she was to then find out it was all a lie. thats literally the whole point if the show. she didn t want to be she-hulk at the start then after someone trying to take that away   she started to work to accept it and as soon as she does  it was taken away again.you mean the men who thought what they were doing was a good idea and not illegal all overjust because you allowed people into your life and personal space  doesnt mean they can do stuff thats illegal the fourth wall breaking was perfect and how she did it in the comics no where did she throw a tantrum. the story you wanted was boring and played out.I am trying to find a single fact in what you said but I cantno where did she blame others.  they did stuff that was illegal. they try to blame her and said her hard work wasn t her hard work.
@elongated man forever  I watched all of the episodes and they was a 7 out of 10 to a 10 out of 10. that finale was perfect. itstarted off interesting then it went off the rails and came back in the way she-hulk does itit is always the haters of good stuff that call other people shills while they are shilling
@darkstalkerknight63  because it was horrible it all lead to nothing  there was no charecter development I doubt you cantell me one thing about this show being good  because its horrible since episode 1 with jenn mistreating her cousin  and attacking guys for no reason jenn is the villain of this show she never takes any responsibility and got the good ending without sacrificing anything  if you like this mediocre show you can  but stop lying and saying its worth anything its pure garbage and had no meaning other then hating men and putting women on a pedestal its a evil show and I hope it never gets a season 2.
@elongated man forever the show was great. she didn t mistreat bruce. if anything  burce assumed what happened to him would happen to her and found it he was wrongwhere did she attacked anyone for no reason. she told them she wasn t interested and they kept trying. or are you not getting no means nothe fact that you assumed the lost her job  her freedom and looked at as a monster isn t a sacrifice  then thats on you. stop lying and saying a good show is bad because it wasn tno where did they hate men but if you felt attacked   thats because you are the bad people in this story they already said it is getting a second season in the show
@futureelement9  we dont know how much time passes between her arrest and going to the retreat. but its enough time for her to lose her apartment  move back in with her parents  and start longing for her life as she hulk again. in terms of literal screen time  she gets arrested at the end of the 8th episode and fixes it by the end of the 9th. roughly 30 minutes of screen time. an entire 3rd act of a movie.
@something right  exactly no accountability.
@elongated man forever  did you stop watching at episode 1  and its funny you focused on her changing the ending to what she wanted it to be  but all she did was take out the chaos of a bunch of hulk s being there. um  she knew she should have listened to bruce because she kept trying to call him throughout the series. and rewarded how  everything she did blew up in her face because the villain turned all of it back on her.
@elongated man forever  she faces no accountability because she... has her entire life ruined as a direct result of her hubris  sorry bud I dont really see how that tracks.if youre saying its because the show ends too soon... that arc is going for about half the show. things go well for about 4 episodes  then her life slowly starts falling apart  then its completely shattered in the lead up to the finale  then she fixes it and the season ends. thats an unbelievably common structure for television.
@something right  no its not enough time at all.
@something right  yes it is all her fault  however nobody ever calls her out for her bad behavior or mistakes and holds her accountable for it  she gets away with everything and even changes her ending to be what she wants and no its not that the show ended too soon its that it had nothing interesting or compelling to begin with all of it was wasting time on stupid episodes that dont develope the characters or the world it was stupid bs like tinder apps  shopping for invisible clothes and shit lawyer scenes this show shouldn t of been made.
@elongated man forever  cheers!
@elongated man forever  you seem really fucking angry dude. calm down. its a tv show about a big green lady its not that fucking serious.several people call her out several times. bruce  nikkI  mallory  emil and his whole group  matt even calls her out for it. sounds like youre just mad she hulk used her most notable ability to save the day. I guess tony faces no accountability in iron man 3 because he just uses his suits to fix everything in like 20 minutes.
@something right  dude I can be mad all I want its a tv show why do you care    just let people voice their opinions. nobody calls her out  nikkI has been congratulating her since episode 1bruce agreed with her uninhiged rant and never questioned her attitude and in the end of the episode she said she was right and he was wrongmallory only helped her to get her way  matt is the only one who does call her out and she doesnt listen she never self reflects because this show is full of narcissistic  self absorbed people who dont take personal responsibility written by women who didn t earn their job and hate men and dont care about superheroes making feminist walters the worst character in the mcu passing karen danvers  this show shouldn t of ever been made.
@something right  tony died sacrificing everything   liron man in his third movie spent the whole time getting crucified and having the consequences of his actions fall on him  where she hulk distorts reality to avoid accountability and has the nerve to be a condescending twatt talking about accountability when she never was accountable   never acted like a hero  instead she acts like a wine mom.
@I am sam32  thank you  I cant stand people who defend this character and her horrible personality.
@elongated man forever  you are literally making up stuff that didn t happened in order to be mad for no reason. she was called out multiple times  she lost her job  house   and her life was destroyed  but you calling losing everything no accountability but then she fought back to find who actually did it and you hate that for no reason
@elongated man forever  I see you are projecting your hate onto her because you cant actually list a single thing in her character and personality that was actually horrible
@elongated man forever  did youreally watch this not a superhero show thinking it was a superhero show.  it literally said from before episode 1  in episode 1  and though the whole season that it hasn t a superhero show but you thought  this is a superhero show  huh
@futureelement9  because we go from climax to resolution in roughly 40 minutes  an incredibly average length of time for that to take  ok
@elongated man forever  Im not talking about endgame Im talking about iron man 3. tony fixes everything in like 30 minutes so he faced no accountability actually
@something right  yes he did  the guy that he was a jerk too tried to kill him.
@something right  do you even know what accountability even is
@darkstalkerknight63  youre the only one making stuff up because there s 0  good things to say about this awful show.
@elongated man forever  many people are listening out so many things that happened in the show and you are literally denying they happened because in your mind   they didn t. the show was good and you hate that
@elongated man forever  yeah and the wrecking crew tried to get she hulk in like the second episode. titania tried to beat the shit out of her at the wedding. todd literally public broadcast her sex tape.
@elongated man forever  you clearly dont know what accountability is because she lost her house   job  life  and freedom and you are upset thatshe caught the people who are the criminals in a show about a lawyer
@elongated man forever  I d call losing your house  job  reputation  and super powers being held accountable. she gains them back  after coming to a proper understanding of her hubris in rejecting bruce s advice. and then she still doesnt get the ending she wanted  because bruce and skaar show up undercutting her big moment at the last second
@something right  the wrecking crew was episode 3  the wedding episode 5but noticed how all of the blood stuff was always at the end of the episode and had nothing to shI with story a or b in the episodes  like it was all a red herring
@lewis baldwin  look up what that word even means before calling someone that clown
exactly. its a great summation of modern feminism also.
@blyat  hI  can I get some context. unless Im missing something I only pointed out positive male characters. Imight have misused something since this has 176 replies
@lewis baldwin  haters  this show said all men are bad actual fans points out more then half the men on the show are goodhaters  this show hates women actual fans points out more then half the women on the show are goodhaters  you are just shilling
her main rival will be frosk
