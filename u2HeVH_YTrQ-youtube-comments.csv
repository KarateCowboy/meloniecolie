Im still fully convinced that gaming journalism is one big money laundering scheme
dude  the early gears games were masterful narratives about hopeless existence   resistance against a monstrous enemy  and the emotional cost of surviving in such a world. dom and the cole train were some of my favorite emotional characters ever.
have no fear minorities a woke white woman is here to save you.  - jade king probably.
as a black man I can say we just want good characters we dont care about your ideologies we just want to play a game with good characters not you pushing your politics on us. ps as a Christian Im glad to hear you preaching the gospel
I dont care about a pansexual  gay  helicopter  etc character. just dont try to push your ideology onto people  or bash people because of what they look like  or if their opinions disagree with you. idk about yall  but I remember when male female whatever or color race wasn t shoved into the forefront of everything. if its an awesome main character then I will vibe. love yall.
after hearing this kinda stuff over the past couple of years Ive strengthened my in group preference considerably. this is them creating exactly what they claim to be fighting. let s see how that works out for them in the long run.
yeah when I read this I almost couldn t believe this actually got published and immediately thought melonie has got to read this  also yes I am of the african decent lol
did she play any of these games   answer  no  she s a gaming journalist  of course she didn t.
spec ops  the line is literally a retelling of the novel  heart of darkness  by joseph conrad. the game was also inspired by apocalypse now which was based off the novel. politics was almost completely removed from the game itself. this was a brilliant story about you becoming a villain through your actions disguised as a run and gun action shooter. she would know that if she played the game!
after jade king s journo job vanishes  she will come up with her own line of hot topic make-up called miss andry. its for women who hate men but want to be as competitive  disagreeable  entrepreneurial  successful  and emotionally unavailable as men
gaming journalism  everyone. way to nail it  melonie.
unrelated  but have you guys noticed how beautiful and happy everyone is here  I swear  those  woke  twitter users are the most bitter  miserable  and ugly people Ive ever seen  inside and out. it has to be exhausting being like that.
1 56 I just made a similar joke a couple days ago. but its amazing seeing a woman that is self aware and intelligent   and courageous enough to make this joke for all to see.7 25 its amazing woman writers get to do this and are awarded and promoted  but if a male esp. a straight white males did anything similar they would. be fired  blackballed  have their professional  and private lives ruined   and be labeled every ist   phobe  and being members of a hate group .	 and that is even if they made a similar article in a tasteful un hateful  un bitter way it would still happen because we no longer have a free press  and have lost that constitutional right and this issue of this infringement of our first amendment needs to be addressed more because we are losing the battle for the first amendment .
being a dude I avoid these types of women Im basically going back to the 1920s trend . I have a nice 1920s hair style Im trying to buy some 1920s clothing gotta look nice and I always have a clean shave  . melonie is a nice common sense person great stuff as always !
I was a big infamous fan and just wanna add  fu - the friendship between cole and zeke was fantastic. those two got more across in their silent beer drinking scene than a dozen over-emotional feminine soliloquies.
no  I dont really feel the need to  engage emotionally  with video game characters whatsoever.whatever emotions I have should come as a result of the gameplay and the atmosphere. the game character is just a placeholder for myself. he or she doesnt need to be emotionally engaging at all most of the time.Im not interested in their sexuality  their little love stories or their personal traumas or opinions.
I just recently started watching your content. you seem very based and I feel like we have a lot in common. stayed based  stay informed  and stay beautiful on the inside and out. God  games  and growth!
there s a reason why I dont taking gaming  journalists  seriously these days. its because most of them are just activist in disguise who dont actually care about video games. lol
its just tiresome how these people act. if something with a woman  minority or lgbt character gets any sort of critcism  its automatically treated as if its purely because of those characters and the gamers just hate anyone who s not a straight white male. it completely ignores the things that have already come out including those groups  that have received praise from the same people. it all just comes down to the fact that these people hold personal ideology above anything else. its why you get people reacting to upcoming shows  not with interest in the shows story or setting  but with how diverse it is. to them  not even quality is above diversity.
chick sounds like she had some bad experiences with  straight white men  herself and is bitter for it
and for promotion of the games they are supposedly  reviewing
@john dodo  imagine being a movie critic and not watching the movie
isn t this also gaming journalism  lol
Im surprised melony is still taking about tlou2... like always the left doesnt understand where the big mad was about... it wasn t about what they hoped  their controversial  id diversity politics   it was bad storytelling and lying about the game  to the point that the dev s pretended it was gonna be another adventure with elly and joel while joel was almost not in the game and you had to play 50  of the game with abby... a character that was not only unlikable  but also boring as shit... and the boss-fight at the end.... it couldn t have been done worse  this is soooo shitty storytelling  in big contrast to the 1st tlou  that is what the big mad was about  not about the dumb politics  that was only just annoying af.
@stijnvdv2  everyone hates the game right and left lol
@daniel n  they do it all the time with movies and games.  I think more so with games being much much longer and more difficult to finish especially for the horrible sjw journos
@stijnvdv2  ya  nobody cared about ellie being the main character.  I was excited because she was older and I could see things from her point of view while still having joel around.  they could have incorporated abbyzilla in a normal way and maybe even had her kill him at the end  but they chose to humiliate joel immediately  and then make us play as the violent offender. that is not even remotely good for any character involved and thats the huge complaint I saw 95 percent of the time.  but the journalists took that other 5 percent  most of whom were trolling for fun  and the writers bit and acted like thats what we all thought.  gaslighting at its finest
you know she used to work for gamestop  right  she is a gaming jorno
they make money because you guys keep going to their sites.  I dont go to their sites to read anything anymore.
yip  remember coles flash back moment to his thrashball days  dom s self sacrifice after clearly being on a path of self destruction upon the discovery of maria  how they cut that from her being still human to what was actually left of her was some of the best cinematography I d seen in a game back then  but nah  all shit according to this  20 an article fucking space cadet
@tyler w  what  what message  how does  I dont know  ign or gamespot reporting on news control ideologies you do know how you sound  right
@tyler w  the only site willing to tell the truth  that Ive seen  is bounding into comics.   Ive seen a few really based articles on thatsite.
exactly. the gender  race or ideology of a character should be an attribute  not their whole damn identity. good characters have depth.

@gamestuh the return of toxicity part 2   honestly it doesnt mean anything but in this generation I have to say this. the amount of time I have had someone tell me that because they didn t know if my ethnicity than I had no option
dude I am with you. I dont care 8f he s white or black. we need good masculine main leader. why  caus the world sorely miss them
halo 4 cortona  was my favorite
I wouldn t mind playing a helicopter character again sometime. haven t played one since simcopter in the 90s. that character arc was formative for me.
great comment
the goal is to try and force every option we have to engage with be the way that they want it  in the hopes that it will eventually cause humans to change in the way they see fit.
agreed. and to take it a step further  not every movie and video game has to have a gay  pan  or helicopter character in it in substitution for a white protagonist. its too obvious and its pandering  not representation.
hit take  but this is why I still liked tlou2. I dont think it was quite a 10  but definitely nowhere near a badly written game. I dont think itshould have been considered game of the year  but I dont think anyone was wrong or unjustified in personally feeling that it was and deserved perfect scores. the story was good  and while I would ve preferred a story where joel lived  his death served the story thematically and just made complete sense in context  something people who simply boycotted it over the decontextualized  and somewhat inaccurate  leaks missed  not that I think people who boycotted it were  wrong  to feel the way they did  mind you . what happened was a very believable  natural consequence of joel s actions at the end of the first game where he mercilessly slaughtered either everyone in his path or everyone but maybe two doctors  depending on whether or not you chose to kill any of the other doctors aside from the one who tried to get in your way . we liked him because we were forced to see him and his story from his and ellie s perspective  but the first game made no secrets of the fact that as great as he was  he was a really  really shady and troubled dude who admittedly and visibly did a ton of shady and unethical things to survive and accomplish his goals. the level of violence he s inflicted on people was bound to catch up to him because thats what always happens.  he who lives by the sword will die by the sword   as the good book said  which is one thing part 2 was kinda communicating . I think his death worked because he wasn t just brushed aside to  make way  for the new characters. his death was respectfully treated as the tragedy it was  and none of the main characters  actions would ve happened were it not for his direct influence on their lives. the amount of non-straight characters and and the non-gender conforming  God help me for having to say that  weren t cliches and hollow stereotypes solely defined by  thatsingle aspect of their identity. they were actually people  well-rounded human beings with complex thoughts  goals and motivations  and they didn t preach at or berate anybody over ideology because thats not what the story was about. regardless of whether I or anyone else thinks  representation  was necessary in the story  it was done properly and appropriately. I think druckman s reach was a bit farther than his grasp  because I think it could ve been paced a little better and would ve made playing as abby an easier pill to swallow for more people if the same story was arranged a little differently  although the lengthy  borderline exhausting pacing toward the end accurately put you in the mindset of the characters themselves   but all in all  as someone who has been vehemently anti-woke since the end of the gamergate days in 2015  Im gonna have to disagree with the popular narrative about tlou2. its probably not my favorite game of 2020  ghost of tsushima probably takes thatslot   but I appreciate and will give extra credit to anything that tries to be ambitious and swings for the fences regardless of whether or not it entirely connects  and Im there for the sequel.
I know all of the arguments for why people claim to hate tlou2  and I even completely understand some of those reasons  but I honestly believe that a lot of it boils down to wrong place  wrong time. I think it would ve been received much better if it was ready to be released a year earlier when life irl was a lot more normal and not a time when people were less high strung due to stress and existential angst over the coof  the pointless authoritarian lockdowns in response to the coof  the economic consequences of which are only going to get worse btw   and the helter shelter race riots that were looting and burning down portions of entire cities and further ruining people s lives across the country at the time. tlou2 was trying to take the audience to a very emotionally raw and psychologically dark place and trying to say something very harsh about human nature  and for a lot of people  it was more than their minds were willing to tolerate at the time because they were getting plenty of that in their own lives. the series in general is about forcing the gamer to empathize with broken and compromised individuals with their own rational reasons for doing things  whether right or wrong  and testing the gray boundaries between those compromised individuals worthy of sympathy and those who are just scumbags you shouldn t feel too bad for when they die. sometimes people fit both categories depending on a given character s perspective  and that level of nuance was respected in both games  which is precisely why I didn t hate abby for murdering joel. as it happened  I found myself thinking   I dont like it  I even hate it  but I totally get why abby would want to take her vengeance on the one who brutally slaughtered her father and friends  which is why I also get why ellie s gonna want to do the exact same thing.  the game was trying to get people to the point of empathy  not necessarily to be conflated with outright sympathy  for  the other   regardless of whether or not you personally agreed with them or not. thats just not a mindset our culture was in or capable of being in upon its release  and I dont think most of us are even willing to adopt that mindset right now.  unfortunately  druckman completely lost the plot of his own story because chronic social media useage makes an ass out of everybody if they re not self-aware and careful.  had this game released only a year earlier when it didn t feel like the world had gone completely insane yet  I think the tone of the conversation surrounding this game would ve absolutely looked different  and we wouldn t have gotten the same level of hyperbolic rhetoric surrounding the game  its story and its characters on either end of the argument. its no one s fault  really  just unfortunate timing.
@tyler w  heck of a post.
@jordan breon  honestly  it might even do us a lot of good. we ve been nice nothing but nice to these people and get nothing but crap for it.
games journo  couldn t get past the loading screen.
@bradley harper  if anything itsubverted her argument of people wanting an emotionless  strictly professional  gun happy  protagonist. I cant think of a worse example to use than that game. its shocking how these people get paid to write articles about the most absurd garbage when any one of us could do better.
the only thing I know about the game is thatscene. it always shows up in top 10 lists. so even if she didnt play the game she could ve at least done 2 minutes of research.....

thats just it. theyb are insufferably negative
thats the way to go low-key
hell yeah!
in detail Im trying to get the peaky blinders thomas shelby hair style its working out very well .
I d happily make the 19th century great again. porkchop sideburns  disappearing to the other side of the world for decades to avoid the womenfolk  and a belief that the future would be better than the past all sound pretty good about now.
@harbl99  women from the 1920s looked beautiful but yeah totally agree
honestly thats part of why I think the new g4 has been failing for that exact reason. tbf its not all their personalities but many of them are just activists pushing their agenda.
most games journalists are just wearing clown make up anyways.
if its any comfort  they ve always been.  Ive been going through my old egm and gamepro  among others  collection from the late 80s and 90s   we didn t notice it back then because they were a lot more subtle about it  but now that Ive seen what all Ive seen  I see it for what it was.
@bearded frog  I suppose youre right but when I also checked out some of the magazines I had too and I noticed that much of the games were far less political so perhaps thats why it was subtle. I think the most activisty content I had was when doa was releasing their extreme beach volleyball games and they were talking about how sex sells and why perhaps that continued to be a thing.
@paul langland  man  thats a trip down memory lane.  but even before that was the controversy over night trap and the hoofla over lara croft  ohhh she s too sexy and its chauvinistic thatshe even exists! .  if you pick up a couple of nintendo powers from the late 80s  there was the big deal over samus aran being a girl... journos made a big deal of it.  players were just casual about the whole experience - we didn t care beyond thinking it was neat thatshe was a girl and not arnie or something.
because all those classes are protected.
also at this point the media and the forced push of political agenda is pushing us towards the point of not wanting any type of those characters  because we immediately know its for agenda and not for good writing
gear 1-3 were definitely an emotional rollercoaster....darn good games.
just found this channel. love it ! keep it up girl.
melonie mac a regular ray of sunshine   positivity in your life .
here s the thing with the last of us part 2. you played as ellie in the first game. no one had an issue with it. the first game had dlc where you find out she s a lesbian  and not a lot of people cared. we saw trailers of the sequel  showing gameplay as ellie and people were excited.the problem stems from straying away from the first game. the whole game was about joel losing what s important  closing himself off from everybody  even his brother  and eventually opening up after bonding with ellie. people wanted a continuation of that dynamic. how has the world changed  what did joel and ellie do after the credits  are there any safe places in this spore-zombie hellscape what we got in tlou2 was ellie and a bunch of characters we dont know or care about  and you hardly get to know them. better yet  there are some who you dont care to get to know because of what they did in the story. no one liked abby. no one cared about her side of the story. she is a villain to the people who loved the first game.and here s the kicker  they knew people would hate joel dying so early on that they recorded special lines for a trailer and slipped joel in to scenes where he doesnt exist. its one thing to do this in the mgs2 trailer  replacing raiden with snake  because the game is based on this theme of not knowing the truth and fabricated context. the tlou2 switch was done to obfuscate joel being dead  to mislead people to think he s still a big part of the game.I was cool with joel dying if it meant something. if he gave himself up so ellie could live  a lot of people would be okay with that. if he became infected and had to tell ellie to move on and leave him  or help him die  thats fine. we didn t get any of that. we didn t even get revenge in the end  and ellie loses everything.there are ways to make bad endings work and feel satisfying. the last of us part 2 wasn t it.and its a not a good thing that this article s author s politics is influencing games. we can explore ideas and tough subjects like in bioshock and spec-ops  the line  but let s not make games a platform for activism  or else we ll write them off just like we do peta when they make cringe pok mon knock-offs.
clearly did not play those games she mentions. spec ops the line deals with mental trauma of war and self-denial and it has for meone of most memorable touching lines in the end of the game when the main character captain walker comes to terms with his actions in the war.  -I never meant to hurt anybody  -captain walker nobody ever does walker  -john conrad.
Ive kind of had a horrible realization about this kind of thinghas anyone noticed  with all this really big push for seeing women to be just as strong  and in some cases  better  then men a lot of movies and video games really push this with women protagonists with very  masculine  traits  such as being physically strong  independent  not relying on others help  and in control of emotions  and they re celebrated as strongyet  we re still leaving stereotype  feminine  traits behind  like makeup  nails  worrying about dates with guys.what Im saying is  movies are making women look stronger by making them act more stereotype masculine  rather then trying to demonstrate strength in things people usually associate with women.we re glorifying tomboys  yet leaving  traditional  girl traits in the dust.so  not much is changing at the end of the day. masculine traits  regardless of the sex demonstrating them  are still being seen as  strong
we need more gun battles and shootouts in romance novels! we need more explosions and gore! representation matters!
some of my favorite video game characters are guys like snake  aiden pearce and haytham kenway. Im not a male or white  but I can still sympathize with them because they re well-written characters. not to mention they re attractive  so thats always a bonus.btw love the outro song  itsuits you well
another great video very glad to be part of the community keep up the fantastic work
every article like this brings me one step closer to my german grandfather.
hI Im new to your channel and Im enjoying everything about it the when I was younger I wanted to make nerdy gaming content with my Christian beliefs behind it I wanted to live stream games and talk with random people about stuff there there going through and possibly praying over them and letting them know that Jesus is always with them its ironic how the first video I watched of you was your first time praying over someone on cam love what you do keep up the hard work
today s verse supports my point from an earlier video where we were discussing judging people. the word we interpret as  judge  or  judging  is more accurately translated as  condemn  or  condemning .only God can condemn people to hell  thats not our place  we are hypocritical sinners  we have no right to condemn.the word  judging   however  has an entirely different meaning in most contexts and especially in scripture.as you said  we make judgements constantly as to who we allow in our friend groups  who can be trusted  etc.if youre walking down a street at night and you see someone you dont know walking towards you  you make a  judgement  call as to whether or not that person is a threat.similarly we  judge  that our friends decisions actions are leading them down a destructive path and we try to guide them in a better direction. thats not condemnation. thats actually love  depending on our methods .we  judge  righteously  as scripture tells us to.thats the point I was trying to make last time. I probably wasn t clear enough at first.love ya  mel. keep up the great work!
thank you for today melonie !
who had  lara croft  on their bingo card    lots of well-made points melonie.
I recently tried to hangout outside my home and got jumped by wasps.  they took my shoes.anyways  the main thing that comes to my mind  without the racism misandry the article writer gave  yeesh  regarding lead euro-descent or even euroid non-human male characters in american video games being the vast majority is how often exceptions pop up without being successor-leads in a franchise  i.e. gta  san andreas  infamous  second son  uncharted  legacy  etc. .I know demographic of players is worth noting but itshouldn t effect lead-character creation because the mostly heterosexual euro-descent male gamers still flock to a good game with the only character to play being non-white non-male  same for classically diverse ensemble fighting games.  since race is not a factor of video game audience attraction per se  shouldn t games with a solo human humanoid lead have been more randomized race-wise by now without it being  create-a-character  they can bring in as many white male leads  heterosexual or not  dont care  as they want  I love many of them.  Im simply curious of how many more polynesian  native american  west asian  etc. males females we could have had and can get more of as the solo lead  without them being a successor-lead and without their race being a big deal in the game  I guess  unless they re of a particular culture  like an african or indian elden ring type game  .I know played tomb raider  mark of krI  beyond good and evil  tak and the power of juju  haven  call of the king  prince of persia  horizon  deathloop  upcoming games redfall and forspoken.  all american games that didn t start with a white guy lead  Im just curious of how much this could expand.  nothing deep  I dont care about seeing  seeing myself   Im simply curious.
interesting little tidbit about the origin of your cat s name. since I know nothing about gow  every time I heard it up until now I thought of john coltrane  the jazz saxophonist...who also happened to be black  but I digress. haha. side note to the side note comment  this is my first comment after several weeks of silent subscribing lurking. good to be here  and I love the format of these videos and what youre doing. the daily verses are the best part  imo. keep it up. God bless!  3
dom s death bought a man tear to my eye.
thatsilly woman doesnt even realize desmond miles isn t white
the meme where picard has his hand on his face in exhaustion and disgust is pretty much the only way I can fully and succinctly communicate my thoughts and feelings about this article...
did you play the games !  no journo has ever though about.
spec ops  the line was not pushing a political message. what it was doing was challenging the player to question the horrible actions they were carrying out in the game for the sake of entertainment. basically it did what tlou2 wanted to do  but failed hard at.
melonie is on fire! Godbless all!
someone should tell these clowns gender isn t a race  its also ironic that people demanding equality  respect and acceptence of their life choices  the first thing they do when they get it  is try to to oppress  disrespect and deny the acceptence of another demographics life choices. hypocrites  the lot of them.
I just recently got an esv study Bible and it is awesome! I think its neat you use esv as well. I grew up with the kjv but its so hard to read.
I feel sorry for her  must be a terrible headspace to live in.
Ive been saying this all the time  can we just respect black people enough to give them their own characters and stick with them long enough for them to become popular  what s happening now is everyone is essentially giving them hand me downs and assuming they ll be happy. so many wasted opportunities to make good non white characters and to give existing ones back the spotlight.
loved your comment on the religious quote at the end of the video.
had to take a day and come back to this video. gets old hearing about how trash you are because you are dude but Im in a fighting mood today.dom was my favorite gears character  so much so that when he went kaboom I stopped playing the game for a few days. that was also the last gears game I played and beat.also shadowman is great game  lead character michael is a black guy  still related to the character  but it originally came out during the ps1 n64 era but there is a remaster out now on steam  runs great.alice from american mcgee s alice is a young woman  love that character  relate to that character  one of those badazz  female main characters like lara croft. at least I think so. proof that this woman has no clue what she is talking about.
master chief might be a hybrid scorpion.  - that new writer.
for the crowd thats crying for more diversity  they re doing a great job at being very exclusionary.
its a bold move cotton. lets see how it pays off.
lol  note that all of the game franchises she mentioned either a  haven t had an entry in over 10 years  or b  came back recently from a long hiatus to do exactly what she s mocking  replacing or backseating the male leads in favor of  strong female characters   usually with extra diversity  that no one liked.
what people had an issue with was seeing  1.5 hours in  joel killed then having to play his roided out masculine female killer for half the game.
samus aran is still my favorite videogame character of all time
Im just proud Ive kept my simpin of melonie to the bare min
its not that we cant judge others its that we cant condem others if we arent perfect either its what Jesus said  only the person without sin can cast the first stone at sinners.we can call out people just remmember to have some compassion if youre not perfect youreself it resembles the saying  dont judge someone before you walked  mile in there shoes
my big problem with lou2 wasn t anything to do with joel dying. it was the character assassination of ellie  and all the original characters. to push the  strong female  home wrecker of a woman to be their focus
who says that the master chief is straight  we assume he s white due to the sound of his voice  but he was always meant to be a blank slate. hell  as far as we know he preferred aI women to flesh and blood women. he seemed to have a real thing for cortana. lol
who ever craps on desmond  hale or cole is legit is just hating for no reason. I ain t even white and still related to them because I can relate to people because they re human and not just a shallow representation of my skin color.
midway through the article when itsays  games should be burly  emotionless violence ripped of any narrative meaning  because who wants to actually engage with the art they consume  am I right  this makes me wonder if the woman who wrote the article actually seriously plays video games. the gameplay is the primary way to  actually engage with the art.  as the player  youre primarily doing the age old  problem solving.  youre trying to get to the end of the game using the tools provided by game  be it using guns  grenades  cover  melee  stealth or whatever else the mechanics allow. whem boiled down  video games are just puzzles in which you need a solution. even in story based games like turn based jrpg s the game usually has quite a bit of mechanical flexibility to allow for multiple ways of clearing the same problem. video games are not just about the story as she seems to want them to be  and they re not just about mindless violence as her strawman seems to think.
they dont care.  this is about power  nothing more  and all the accusations of hypocrisy in the world wont stop them.
and a guy that looks like the director spiting on joel and rainging abby in on seen thats almost r@pey.
and now you have to play the character who murked the one you all liked  admired and respected. hahahaha! suck it purchasing customer base. ellie s gay by the way. these...people.
its not just that   it was completely out of character.  no way joe and his brother would ever put themselves in that position  entering a room with complete strangers.
I believe its pretty obvious thatshe doesnt  p
she wants visual novels.  which is fine  but those are not actual games.
I d like to point out that the  journalist  frames the whole thing as someone who wants to enjoy this  art   which really is the result of a push towards making games recognized as art over entertainment. that the parts of a game are greater than the sum of it  and its not the end result we are trying to enjoy. thats really where games started losing their identity as a source of joy  and turning into a spinoff of hollywood in a sense.
its envy  cowardice   jealousypure   simple
love the verse of the day.  maybe a happy comment about a bill that is being trashed in the news lately.
was this an april fools article  hope so
this  jurno  leaps in logic are unfathomable.
volunteers to yeet jade into the van and ludovico technique her with the lotr films until she understands how men relate to one another. anyone
@meloniemac very love this video. great content !
so far as Im aware  male gamers think aloy is awesome  just like most other video game women.
seriously 97  of my favorite games or games I play are made in japan  not by hwite mayne
Im personally not religious but I do like many Christian values. youre supposed to love others but also have good judgement and discernment. in context love means to be kind and caring. so while youre supposed to be kind and caring that doesnt mean youre supposed to condone or go along with things that are wrong or harmful  at least that you perceive as such  in summery this means if someone doesnt agree with your life choices but isn t rude about it and while not bringing it up they re perfectly pleasant thats ok. another point is that culture is what determines. if I say there s two people  one has baggy pants and wearing chains while the other has their shirt tucked in and a pocket on their shirt and you assume the race of those people thats your problem. for me the first thing that comes to mind is  gang or thug  for the first and  nerd or working class  for the second
I think this is suppose to be an april fools joke
I didn t care that ellie was the main character it was the way the storyline was told if it was set as a marauder raid or of something similar the storyline of ellie going on a revenge mission would have made sense not some quest marker story bs
like 99  of my favorite characters in fiction are japanese. cope harder journos
day 24 of commenting on your videos. streak still strong.bruh spec ops the line has the most consequences of any game. no idea what she s talking about. the game is literally about what she s trying to make it out to be. its about the consequences of just following orders and just doing what the game tells you. super meta. proof right there she didn t play it. plus in the thumbnail she has chief  who never takes off his helmet  not counting the show obvs  and shepard whom you can make... however you want and as gay or female or asian  etc. as you want. play the games youre using to back up your arguments sheesh.
something something male main characters... tfw dom sacrifices himself to save marcus and the team.
as a former gaming journo this is gettin ridiculous
the journo sounds like some kind of crazed doomsayer lol. nowhere in that article did I see any data backing up what she said. it was literally all pontification.
we have had badass women. now the women are almost becoming genderless
the journo s piece should have been titled   paper tiger  the article.
they are just pressing buttons and their life means nothing.
what is a woman  not sure. I ain t no biologist.
okay now I wanna see what the italian senate has been watching recently.
Im so tired of the mainstream
personally I did enjoy tlou2 but I understand the people that didn t like it either
melonie  look up esg money and you ll know why they re going this route.
you dont need to destroy male characters to make space for non male characters. there is infinite space. they just dont want to do that. they want to destroy.
I think people cared about ellie being a lesbian and the protagonist of tlou2  they cared for the why she is those things  that is for subvertion  for  highjacking  as the article says.
how can I become a game journo
last of us  left behind was actually done with genuine class and good narrative. they delicately established a bond and a past with riley  it made us fall in love with her before the kiss came  so when it did  for most of us at least it was very welcome.thats why nobody gave a crap about whats her face from 2  because she just appeared out of nowhere as ellies new love interest and the game immediately demanded right off the bat that we be more emotionally invested than before based on nothing. oh waitsorry  Imeant to say Im just an irrational homophobe and I didn t like last of us 2 cos of teh gahy
Imiss desmond....I have the ac logo tatted on my bicep. - straight white male
love the shephard in the first picture.  omg mass effect and their straight white male lead!!!!   umm... you know you can make the lead character female  hens the term femshep right    what  ! ! !  reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
I find it funny how they always claim that these diversity efforts are meant to  better reflect the real world  yet they always either over-represent these groups  or put them in places where it doesnt make sense. I highly doubt there would be an abundance of lgbt characters in a post-apocalyptic setting like tlou.
do any actual gamers take advice from gaming journos
its funny that they still try to use the last of us 2 as this perfect game thatshowed all the bigots...while joel s death was actually just stupid writing that made no sense to get cheap emotional moment and start what they thought is big brain message about revenge. but in reality they just made many players hate the game when they decided you will now play as the character you now hate cause she killed joel cheaply
I hope this year will be the end of the  game journo buzzfeed is about to flop and the rest will follow
she clearly never played the newer wolfenstein games bj has some of the best development its why they are my favorite games
I wasn t interested in last of us 2 either way. the first game was great and I felt that it was a one and done for thatstory.
yeah they know nothing about dom s story if they are saying there s no feeling behind it
oh no she didn t!  dissonant murderer nathan drake   too funny.  she didn t mention sully and his rich chuckle or wes 44 - I really dont get the  I played that  vibe from her article.
awww shit here we go again
you  gotta love it when non-gamers comment on games that they know nothing about. also when they complain about games  not having diversity  but then posting a gears of war image with cole  a black man  in it. my response is  play the games all the way through  before you comment on them!
I always preferred femshep. to me jennifer hale does the character best. the design is also way better than maleshep. I suspect the female version will be canon in me5.
@dying rose   3 jennifer hale
@jessie o  she s great.
gamers dont read gaming journalists  and gaming journalists dont play games.its a strange world....
@krausewitz  clownworld
same.
yup
Im a brown girl  bisexual and I unironically agree. we need more straight males  doesnt matter about the race to me. white brown or black.also dina or whatever her name was in tlou2 was completely toxic   I completely lost interest in gears once the main character became female I lost interest. I liked that this game explored the male spirit. I didn t hear a peep from a gaming journalists about how 99  of returnal s fan base is male. last I checked no man cared that the main character was an older woman. where are all the women playing returnal  this fantastic game with such a well written female main character
thank you.
never forget what they did to aloy   uhhh... Im a straight white male and Ive got over 200 hours on each horizon game.  what are they claiming they did to aloy   sure  I would have liked more heart strength mind choices  a bit more straight representation  and a better ux in the sequel but the character was pretty consistent.  still tried to go off on her own  with that mindset that only she could save the world  but this time her friends insisted on stepping up.  none of my complaints with forbidden west are in any way connected to the heroine.  I am not afraid of a strong woman.  I was raised by one and am drawn to them  in fact.
the article is an aprils fools joke innit
its the law of woke projection. what game did she like  the last of us 2 which is the most politically driven game Ive ever seen.
let s be honest  she really just hates her father.
sounds to me like a crazy cat lady is pissedoff thatshe cant  find a man. how much do you want to bet thatshe s close to the wall.
I wouldn t say ellie having a gf went over well....it was dlc tho so most people just ignored thatstory and continued with ellie not being sexual characteralso people really hated tlou2 cause of that butch vilian girl...as well as joel dying...the whole story pissed people off
spec ops the line was haunting
why do these losers have to always lie and be disingenuous   I loved tlou. I have not played the 2nd one and I will never play the 2nd one. my reasons are strictly based on neil druckmann and how he handled the situation and accused us of horrible things. we all knew ellie was a lesbian. we all played the  left behind  dlc. and as you said  no one cared. no one had a problem with it. why do they insist we have a problem with her since she is gay  I dont get it. even someone looking from the outside  who isn t familiar with the characters . once they find out the truth  you just lost their trust permanently. these people just constantly lie and bend reality. eventually they ll have no one left on their side as more and more people open their eyes. denial until the grave  I guess. its just pathetic.
I dont care if a protagonist is female. I dont care if they are lesbian or gay. what makes me not want them in a game is when they are there to obviously punch you in the nose with messaging that breaks my immersion.  make new gamez with that content and good luck selling it. dont hijack my games that I know and love and them yell at me because you put stuff in it that you knew would piss me off.
this will end exactly like g4tv ended  its only taking some more time  and then they will all cry and go reeeeeeeee
I dont get this article.  how long ago was last of us 2   this is hardly timely.  I would have loved last of us just as much if they had changed joel s sex or race as long as the story was just as good.  the problem is the way the protagonist from the first game was treated in the second like they didn t even care.
I thought kitty was coltrane... so awesome that its coletrain!
ellie and dina were vulnerable and honest  you dont see that in straight white male characters!  ...you mean like joel in the first game  idk if they re making fun of a strawman or they literally think all those games had zero emotional storytelling. or that if a game is gameplay focused its just  content   give me a break.
Ive never understood this idea that you need to play a character who looks like you on such a superficial level. tomb raider was my favourite game series when I was younger  and whenever I can create a character  they re always female.also  last I checked  blue hedgehogs dont play games.
good day  melon
so she calls that diversity  excluding and hating on one half of a whole race  yeah sure.all of this makes me realize that my teacher actually had a point when he said  straight white  men have it worse than us women or most other people really.
who said such disgusting things
this game journo is acting like there aren t already a ton a bad ass female characters in video games  and guy gamers do love that. we do love characters like lara croft  samus aran  chun-lI  jill valentine  aloy  ect. and the list goes on. I honestly dont get where this strawman comes from  Ive not even seen anyone complain about most female video game characters except the sjws. so itstands to reason that they hate woman  not  angry male gamers .
they turned her into a lesbian  indirectly so  but they did. by making elisabeth sobeck a lesbian they did the same for aloy. the simping enemy trying to kidnap her at the end was a lame  twist   made little sense  was predictable and did little for the story as a whole. what a disappointment they had to put their identity politics in a game. remember that of the  6 relationships seen throughout the game  all but one were homosexual couples  and they killed the dude in the only heterosexual relationship like a bitch.
@daniel diaz  despite the dna  aloy and sobeck were never the same person  but I disagree there were no signs of her being into women in zd.  I got flirty vibes between her and petra. but then there was always that will they wont they type of relationship between her and erend  and to a lesser extent  varl.  obviously the latter is off the table now but she also gave serious consideration to the offer to be the sun queen back in zd  and didn t completely write it off in the beginning of fw.  I dont think the writers really understand how reproduction works.  the world is far too dangerous  and its population too small to have that many gay couples.  eleuthia is shut down  and their tech knowledge is not nearly advanced enough to deal with even the slightest of complications.  maybe the quen have advanced far enough  but the other tribes certainly haven t.
I thought that might be the case at first  but it really seems its just them using april fools as a way to vent their hatred in a sarcastic manner.
I did not play that dlc because I dont care for tokenizing characters to fit the gay agenda. ellie is straight. the gay stuff isn t canon and neither is the second game.
I wanted a zombie game  not a golf game! thatsimple! the prequel comic and left behind dlc were all about her relationship  I didn t care until you kill joel for no good reason!
I enjoyed the experience of the first game. wasn t a diehard fan  but it was a memorable experience. the second one had so many lies  controversy  and underhanded antics attached to it that I didn t even care to play it. especially when I learned joel was assassinated very early in the game. most of what made the first game great was the dynamic between ellie and joel.. then we had to play as the character who murdered him..  it d be like if they brought shepard back for me5  brutally murder them in the most uncharacteristic and anti-climactic way  and then make us play as the character who killed them.  its just a huge insult to fans to pull stunts like that.
I didnt have to be an italian plumber to enjoy playing mario....I didnt have to be a woman to enjoy playing metroid... I didnt have to be an  elf  to enjoy playing as link....
the person who wrote that article doesnt know what  ludonarrative dissonance  means  otherwise they wouldn t have compared ellie to nathan drake and then said he has it and she doesnt. with the way the game play in tlou2 sets it up  either ellie only views her direct friends and enemies as people cause she takes apart randos like a butcher on the butcher   the tv show   or the ludonarrative dissonance on display is extreme. she ll slaughter man  woman  and dog with brutal efficiency and zero hesitancy before being unable to handle killing her enemies in a cutscene  and then going on to slaughter without wavering even a little.in fact give ellie a bigger health pool and more ammo and watch how the gameplay becomes more uncharted-like.
mass effect  original  has spicy lesbian scene which gained outrage. some people cared about it back then. otherwise I got banned from discord. could you possibly open a guilded server plz  or join jeremy s
straight white man here  played last of us 2  and loved it. I didn t care one bit about ellie s orientation  her story was worth experiencing. period.
oh man melonie gears of war 2 thats the spot  . a worm that eat cities ! thats a good mission from gears 2 thats a good gem   I like your videos yeahyeyeyeye  !
I love how the first image of the article has commander shepard  the character that has no canon apparence nor a canon gender. so like shepard is as much a straight white male as a black lesbian woman lmfao
I love that they re so ignorant that the characters they have targeted in the banner of their passive-aggressive  racist  sexist diatribe are joel  a universally loved and well-written protagonist who was famously killed off by bigoted idiots  master chief  a guy who never shows his face and shepherd  a character you can literally change the appearance and even sex of.fuck me  literally all these guys are good at is bigotry and they re still kinda shit at even that.
if these people can get jobs as games journalists  damn  I gotta apply lmfao. maybe actually play and review games  I know  kinda unconventional.
just make a good game and you can have whatever demographic you like... this article has to be satire.
I wonder how she feels about the white men winning women of the year and womens sports championships. she too quite because they would turn on she so fast
you can make shepherd any race or sex you want. the original me3 had a dual insert of male and female shepherd. kair was annoying but I still beat gears 5  twice.Im just annoyed that I cant play locust in pve. not as annoyed as I am that they removed multiplayer from me3 legendary  though.seriously  thats disingenuous.Godzilla still sucks. all hail gigan.
I like that jade king just lumps everyone s outrage of joel s death only to white straight men. they ruined the story by doing that and I hated it. Im a gay man! I dont give a crap what the gender race sexuality is of the characters as long as the story is good and the characters are likeable interesting. stop trying to tack on your agenda to gaming thinking that we like that because we re  minority s  your nobody s saviour  maybe except for a few twit twats. love your channel by the way!
commenting to feed the algorithm
I love how this  game  urinalist reduces video games to a triple-a character action game with 3rd person perspective and stealth elements.you can see the level of culture they have about the medium.how can you take anything they produce seriously please  stop falling into obvious rage bait articles with no content whatsoever.
I love how they show gears of war but the most brutal one is kinda cole who is black lol
ahh yes  another person who is happy to celebrate violence towards people based on their gender  skin colour and sexuality. youre right  they re trying to gaslight people  I can feel they re hatred in these words and its sad.its funny you d mention lara  the devs first idea for her was a white male just like indiana jones  and they were asked to redesign them  and came up with lara.
the thing that bothers me about this complaint thatstraight white men are the leads of most games in the west is that almost all of our stories of people doing stuff are straight white men. the majority of our soldiers  marines  air force  intelligence agencies are straight white men.
go boom!!!!!
I cared.  humanity was teetering on the brink of annihilation  ellie had a vital gene that needed to be passed on to save humanity  and instead she s slated for homosexuality  thereby dooming the entire human race.  I had a problem with that.  one  thatshe s female  which severely blunts the reproduction rate  and two  had the roles been reversed  then the male immune  let s call him ernie  would have been killed instead of joel s female counterpart.  whom we ll call jane   why would ernie die   to make a statement that there will be no white male saviors  and jane would probably have done it herself.  in both cases  women are the doom of humanity.  you know who else doomed humanity   pandora.  eve.  lillth  who ended up being why eve was made  just sayin   we need to stop with this nonsense.  women already have a track record of being the reason humanity dies - anyone remember helen of troy   hera plaguing joppa   medea  anybody   that one chick that called the hyper advanced aI to destroy the galaxy in picard season one   modern women need to stop being an ongoing trope!
gears is the posterchild of intersectional feminism  especially with 5  and they use it as an example of  haha whitemen smash am I rite !  lol these people dont know what they do  they just want the 4 page evergreen for a paycheck.
not being judgemental is the most misunderstood verse in the Bible. the Bible does not say  dont judge others.  itsays  judge not lest ye be judged   which is saying not to be self righteous or hypocritical. if you judge others based on their behavior  and you dont behave that way  then you would be judged innocent  but if youre a hypocrite and do the same things  then you ll also be judged guilty. at the same time  all sin is equivalent in the eyes of God  so if youre willfully sinning  yet judging others for their sins  gossip mongers in the church decrying homosexuality comes to mind  because boy oh boy are there a lot of gossips in church  in my experience    in the eyes of God  youre the same.
5 28 Im willing to bet that the person who wrote the article not only didn t play most of those games but purposely avoided some of them  particularly spec. ops  the line
they seem oblivious that many non-white straight men also enjoy white male characters like joel. then there s the homosexual side of things. they normally dont interest me  but some games like dragon quest xI  ys ix and the first life is strange did them quite well with little to no forced pandering. so far max and chloe is the only  lesbian love story  I found quite touching.
@mr. sinjin-smyth  yeah exactly I agree! I liked life is strange  they didn t shoe horn it in like they do with most games shows. now they make it the selling factor as if its meant to attract people to it. its so annoying how they treat people who are not white straight men as if we re a monolith and they re doing us a favour or service by ruining properties we love for  diversity .
I will also help right now
same
for those saying that Im going to hell  I say   maybe so. dont forget to save me a spot.  then again  my brother  Jesus  has different plans for me.
does your cole train run on whole grain
lol  mad at tlou2 cuz joel died and was replaced by a lesbian. more like they betrayed his character by having him die due to something completely out of his character. abby sparing ellie s life twice for no reason at all. ellie sparing abby s life because  dur no more hate dur . the fact that they lied and made you think joel was in most the game or how about abby taking it up the ass lol. maybe it was the simplistic gameplay and half the game being cutscenes. or an absolutely beautiful looking game being mostly linear. how about being forced to play as abby for sympathetic bs right after watching her take a club to joel s head. but yeah  its cuz I didn t want to play as a lesbian  need muh strong white male to enjoy games.
and those losers wonder why us gamers laugh at them and ignore them at the same time
remember when video game characters  story and plotlines were generic enough to where no one knew  nor cared  about what sexual orientation  gender  sex nor race anyone in the game was   pepperidge farm remembers
yeah  you gotta be kidding me with the gaslighting. no one is mad at diversity  we re mad thatsome of our favorite characters are being brutally sacrificed on the altar of diversity. if you cant introduce a new character without first destroying an existing one just make a new game entirely to put your woke garbage in. but I think even they know that no one would pay for their woke wet dreams without established titles giving them a sense of legitimacy  eg  rings of power  star wars sequel trilogy  etc   so unfortunately there s no end in sight to the woke washing of our beloved franchises.pstotally should have left a link to  straight white male  by tom macdonald in this video  its the most appropriate kind of brain bleach for the cringe in this article  lol
so  at 2 00 ish  you theorise on the race of jade king. in that instant  I was assuming black because last name king. my point is  someone needs to go and tell mizzzz king thatshe is a terrible human being for having dared to culturally appropriate the name king and must immediately apologise to all african americans and change her name to something more appropriate.
I ll be honest. the urnalists is wrong.Im not a fan of same sex stuff but I like ellie personality so much that I just tolerate it. I wasn t a fan of the last of us dlc but Im not white.neil druckmann and the woke cult made tlou part 2 terrible!! ellie and other characters were written poorly to the point she was unlikable compared to the original in my perspective. neutered dog shoved the most ignorant political leaning statement to the point it disgusted me that the industry voted that game goty while ghost of tsushima got snubbed multiple times.
shout out to invisible mikey tokyorevengers
Im going to be honest  we dont know if most leading characters are  straight  white men . and this is for a straightforward reason  most games dont bring up the character s sexuality. also  who cares about a character s race  sexuality  or sex  make a good character  and people will like it.
let me guess   she s about to start a onlyfans and will need white men money
this is why I dont game anymore. became to toxic because of wokies.
to quote the great drunkler  hey guys  ellie was gay btw. you know  she actually is gay. guys she is gay
what mic and headset you using  sound quality good!
nice mel!
for people that are supposed to sound happy and are activism and all that jazz they sure dont sound happy why is that
judge not least you be judged according to the lingth of your own judgement. in other words be careful of how harshly you judge others.
malcolm x warned us about jade king.
yeah I dont think these game journalist actually played games back then when stories with dom and other stories like that was actually going on
....this lady making it pretty obvious she doesnt  play  games as much as observe or at best goes for the non-action games.sounds more like she bought a ticket for the hate train and didn t bother with gaming so much as personal opinion.
go retro. good games still exist. the new stuff sucks.. unless its coming outta japan.
@dying rose  Ive just been playing apps as of late  raid  shadow legends  star trek fleet command  guns of glory. on pc its league of legends.
@shandI nicole beard  the infamous raid  shadow legends.. ha ha you cant go wrong with pc though. Im more of a nintendo person myself.
I am telling you.. that ellie is an actual lesbian  michael.
all those western journalists complaining that there is too many white male protagonists dont understand the problem. when sucker punch made ghost of tsushima  the same western journalists complained at them  how dare they make a japanese protagonist when they are not japanese themselves - so  apparently  according to western video game journalists  western game developers which are in vast majority employing white men are only allowed to make white male protagonist  nothing else. they dont have enough women on staff to make female protagonists  and they dont have enough different ethnicities either  so the only remaining choice is white male protagonists - this is  if anyone would be taking those journalists seriously  but its funny seeing them fall over their own words again and again  it really is.
jade king  more anita sarkeesian 2.0
Im detecting some frosk urine levels of vitriol here. I bet she was frothing at the mouth as she wrote this garbage. games journos are the worst.
2nd and also how many hours game journos can play before they give up lol
these people acting like we haven t played some amazing characters who weren t white men since the 90s
I dont think most gaming journalist  play the games anymore you should read about how the we re talking about gow and how it was the toxic masculinity  sexist misogynistic fantasy game tactical bacon productions did a good video on it called the on thing everyone gets wrong about God of war
tell me you haven t played videogames without saying you haven t played videogames.  p
well its people like that pretty much  made minorities and women in games dull and boreing less the cancel twitter mob come for you. so writter olny needs to look in the mirror who the real problem is.
white women might want to focus on saving biological women s rights.
water is wet
jade king said those things
did you just assume that journo s race and gender!!!  she he might just identify as a pansexual mexican man! why  Im so offended Im going to cry in my soy milk in my safe space.
baird not bard!
tlou 2 is a shame  the gameplay is awesome but the games story is so cringey every 20 minutes I had to stop.
ya and have women too n dom died
the question is  is she relevant   the answer would be  no . it just smells of being desperate at wanting to be noticed.
capt. save-a-minority  I cant find anything to say about this that even remotely feels appropriate to say. I wouldnt be surprised if this person s pronouns are bleeder birthing person
no one cared about last of us 2  thats the problem.  also  in a post apocalyptic society there are more important than who youre scissoring  like making more humans to survive.  but damn  this woman hates men  its dripping with each of her words.
what delusional looks like.
who tf is going to gears of war looking for a romantic subplot. let alone gay themes.
I thought I said baird lol
sorry for being a day late buy this article reads like it was written as satire. wait a second....saying that those games were pushing a political agenda just blows my mind.
gave up on them.meteor please. or nukes. just end it.
they re still talking about the last of us 2  its so boring and old at this point
jade king is a man
what is she talking about  she s mocking  wokies  and simultaneously laughing at an article for being too right-leaning
just make games with good characters and stellar writing  and stop turning gaming into yet another empty political statement
romance in games is kind of shit period. the father and daughter dynamic was more powerful than ellie and a bland girlfriend.
these are the people killing the gaming industry. also tlou2 was bad because the story was crap.  joeldidnothingwrong
gameinformer anthor shitty game site with journalists giving bad takes.
melonie is tom raider underworld better than tom raider 2013
the real question is what kind of editor would greenlight an article as pointless  and poorly written as this
marcus fenix was not white  when have you ever heard of a white guy named  fenix
I just want to say that after I heard   read and saw this video that I can not believe thatsomeone just wrote this bout this issue and publlist this on internet. anyway what in the heck are they thinking and how dumb are they of putting this crap on internet  anyway I am a white man and I just dont understand why someone who is white or is black wants to put this out on internet and make a trashy comment bout white woman and white man gaming industry and make a racial comment bout this and want people to read this crappy garbage and want us viewers to believe this crap story  anyway I just want to say that bout this topic and I do hope you do agree with me and I do hope you are not mad at me for commenting on this topic  ok melonie. anyway I hope you have a wonderful and great blessed evening at home with your pets and have a good night too  ok melonie.
the boomer generation is the reason for the mess we re all in now.
frosk g4 o another woke wannabe non gamer aw who cares ......jump on the paramount   halo series wagon. gamers have their favorite characters and games. leave us be .was hoping that games anything about games would be left out of this stupidity. do they know games are not real  creators make the games keep woke crazy out. I wouldn t buy any games that hint at their crap . . keep up the good work love your channel.
why is it always white women  probably with neon hair  who feel compelled to speak on behalf of other race s concerns and feelings
you should watch mannix s videos
he looks white to me and his son is white as heck lol
nah  really it began with gen x.
gen z
@warren perkins  youre correct concerning the recent larger picture my friend.but Im a gen x guy myself. and sadly  some of my compatriots started sneaking in tiny woke stuff here and there back in the day....
its everyone.
