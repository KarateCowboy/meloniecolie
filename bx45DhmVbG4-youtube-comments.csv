self control is a virtue . its so fitting in a society that never wants to take responsibility for their actions.
Im here from the quartering camp. I just wanted to thank you for not minimalizing others beliefs. I was raised by an athiest  father living in a land of predominantly religious people  I was the only non-mormon in my school . Ive studied a lot of religions and I guess I d be considered spiritual. most of my friends are Christians. it doesnt stop us from being friends at all. Im also fairly conservative. that being said...Ive watched a lot of your content as it pops up on my feed. you make your videos feel like a discussion among friends having coffee. and that is a welcome breath of fresh air in a society that judges first then talks down to after. you are a light in the darkness! keep it up! also...I completely agree with you on this video!
thank you for being comfortable enough with your faith to share it publicly. refreshing!
this girl is one of the most based people Ive seen. constantly referring to the Bible for guidance and supporting statements and opinions. great job melonie  and thanks for being a role model.
a gaming content creator throwing in biblical references. thats rare   appreciated. God bless  miss mac.
I was raised extremely Christian  wasn t allowed to listen to pump up the jam or play maniac mansion as a kid or celebrate halloween  and as I got older I realized  as I separated myself a little from the church  that while the word of God is absolute in my mind  the translation of it by man can  and in a lot of cases is poisonous. and her is another perfect personal example of this happening. I had a friend who fell in love with a girl. she had been married previously and they dated for 2 years. they decided to get married  but my friend was a extreme Christian. and when they went to the pastor  the pastor told him that he would be sinning if he was to marry the girl  as she was previously married. being a devoted Christian  my friend called everything off and broke up with the girl. he then was told video games were sinning  and he cut out all gaming in his life. he went down a very dark path imo  all in the name of the Lord  and backed by his pastor. I didn t see him for awhile and then ran into him at a outdoor bar a couple years later. he was plastered and I sat down and talked to him and he told me he was now into drug use as well  and itseemed his life had went down the toilets  and I wondered  what could his life had been if the word of God wasnt twisted by a poisoness man and he did marry the girl he was in love with  and didn t cut himself off in God s name... this is why Christianity in my opinion has come under fire the past 10-15 years  and people dont believe anymore. maybe its just me though..
absolutely love the Bible references thrown in to all these vids
youre lucky in that youre young. Im old enough that I remember the satanic panic. back in the late 80s  I was leaving the mall with my new ad d books when I was literally smacked with a Bible and screamed at. I dont hate Christians or anything  I consider myself one. but that was messed up. that woman hit me in the face with a Bible! lol
gotta say  as a fellow Christian  I was absolutely astonished when I finally decided to sit down and read my Bible  cover to cover  and found so many things I d  learned  in church weren t necessarily  true . the bereans had it right. soldier on!
I feel like brian s comment was condescending.  I hope one day we can just go back to where a woman can just be herself and be proud to be herself and a man can be masculine and be allowed to be a man.  also I hope we can just learn to accept that every person is different and stop trying to tell each other who to be.
glad to see you speak your mind on subjects that a lot of creators would avoid at all costs. keep up the great content and keep up the awesomeness.
personal responsibility is the most important thing.
woke people dont want to improve themselves  because that takes effort. and so everybody else has to be brought down to their level so that they can feel better.
this was cool as hell. paul and peter without the church jargon makes them seem like real people...almost like context makes a world of difference. great half hour
that intro was better than the new trilogy
love the fact that this turned into a positive Bible study  context is always important.
so to sum it all up  people should take responsibility for their own shortcomings instead of blaming others. some life lessons are timeless themes.
the demand for  and enforcement of  purity in others is the most insidiously fertile ground for one s own sin. great message tonight. Im sure it touched many.
loved the intro by spencer  so funny.  thank you for tackling such an interesting topic  and including Bible verses in your videos - its refreshing to hear these days!
love that you fuse your faith into each vid  its refreshing for sure. keep up the great content.
amen!
Imean the guy ended up accidently showcasing the double standarts when it comes to sending unsolicited pictures online. then there s also the fact that there isn t really anything thatsuggests that he holds that view because of that Bible verse  its possibility but it ain t given whether or not its the case. him saying that as a way to try and make others accomodate for his shortcomings so to speak is also something that more assumed then anything  tho again its possible its just not certain whether or not thats the case
it isn t just a virtue  it is one of the fruits of the spirit.
@austin smith  exactly
another thing is the Bible does talk about modesty. modesty is definitely a culture thing  but itstill defines a dress code. in fact  the very verse she takes completely out of context and conveniently omits the first half of that verse is 1 tim 2 9  in like manner also  that women adorn themselves in modest apparel  with shamefacedness and sobriety  not with broided hair  or gold  or pearls  or costly array   --- what does she think  modest apparel  even means  apparel clearly means clothing  and this is how merriam-webster defines  modest  in terms of clothing   of clothing   not showing too much of a person s body
@kiwI productions  where your argument falls short is  not showing too much of a person s body  is a subjective statement  also as melonie pointed out its not about the level of dress. I assume you dont advocate burkas  so let s settle on victorian standards. at that time the glimpse of a ladies ankle was considered provocative. I dont know about you  but I cant think of a single person that thinks of ankles as sexy. tastes haven t changed  it wasn t that victorian men got hot and bothered by ankles  but rather the fact that they allowed there imaginations to envision the skirt to keep rising as they undressed the woman in there mind  she had no part in there lust. a corps has no part in a necrophiliac s mental illness. we should take responsibility for ourselves  our thoughts  and our actions  not blame others for them.
@kiwI productions  agreed.regardless  the point of that verse is not so that others dont lust after the woman. thats not the motive.the motive is in the beginning.the Bible doesnt condemn lustfulness. it does condemn coveting.but its impossible to covet what doesnt belong to another.so yes  that Bible verse from Jesus condemning the pharisees was for them coveting others  wives as being just as guilty as having sex with those wives who they re not husbands of. look up the ancient greek language.
when it comes to action I agree  but u can lust after any1 u want thats not a crime its part of being human  but if u feel it is  like she said  dont blame the object  ppl are not objects but u get my meaning  of ur lust
@kiwI productions  some ppl twist what Bible says to excuse their issues or hate on something
@shadow wizard  except that Jesus told the religious leaders it was wrong to lust after the married women  or if the religious leaders were themselves married  that it was wrong to lust after anyone.
I had a similar upbringing  but Ive been saved and now in a Christian. however  most of my friends and coworkers are non-religious and has absolutely zero factor in our friendships. we all walk our own paths and rarely do we know where those paths will lead us and thats what makes life so amazingly precious! case in point  where all here supporting melanie mac and we got here from different places and in different ways. good to meet you  friend.
@mike kilo  its nice to meet you as well. all walks of life cross paths some mesh... others dont. but we dont have to hate.
@jiyin  amen!
Im not against religion even if Im not religious. I think having a framework for morality helps people make better decisions which is a net positive for society as a whole.
I knew about melonie mac and have been following her  for a while now under a different account that was banned by yt   long before the quartering gave her a shout-out.
@delvien vol  I have no ill-will against Christians or religious people in general either. I only have a problem with those who cant take no for an answer and try to forcibly instill their religious beliefs and values onto everyone else who doesnt share the same values as them.
@independent aquaman  I say what matters is what ever he or she acts on that lust cause sometimes ppl lust over some1 and they dont know that he or she is married
@shadow wizard  the point is that once you know to then stop.
@independent aquaman  I agree with that point  continuing after isn t healthy
@goldbone grooming  did you conveniently ignore the part where I said its a culture thing. its completely possible to be modest in regards to the culture you currently live in and go to another country   culture and be completely immodest wearing the exact same thing. there are several things in the Bible  modesty included  where it is dependent on culture you live in  but the Bible still requires you to use wisdom and discernment of where and how to separate yourself to the world.
@shadow wizard  thats very true. its also incredibly common for things to be cherry picked   taken out of context. I view the fact that the Bible has it printed as chapter   verse to be a double edged sword. many people dont realize that the chapters of the Bible actually have paragraphs and its rare for a verse to be a paragraph. this means when you quote a single verse you often are omitting context that is relevant to that verse. its even worse when you quote only a part of a verse.for instance  1 tim 2 9 is part of a paragraph that goes from 2 8 to 2 10  so 2 9 at a minimum should be read as  I will therefore that men pray every where  lifting up holy hands  without wrath and doubting. in like manner also  that women adorn themselves in modest apparel  with shamefacedness and sobriety  not with broided hair  or gold  or pearls  or costly array  but  which becometh women professing Godliness  with good works. there are exceptions to this of course. for instance  the psalms aren t in paragraph form because they are psalms. I think proverbs also isn t in paragraph form. but in those cases the context can still be lost by quoting a single verse from them because the context is the whole psalm or proverb.
exactly
it is but then you wouldn t parade your valuable possessions  go to work with all your doors and windows open and expect to return how to a full house.
they refuse personal accountability but they demand accountability for others.
amen!
her favorite game should be doom eternal.
amen. melonie is a God-send  literally.
@skrellowtyper   sounds like biden s america
I d like to see the passage from scripture thatsays video gaming is a sin.unfortunately  too many Christians just pull stuff out of their rear and call it a sin  having no biblical backing whatsoever.and I daresay that this behaviour is actually sinful. a hardline interpretation would see it as heresy even.if youre a man of God  you cant just run around and pervert scripture in order to shame people for doing stuff that you disagree with on a personal level.
if being religious is to be a relationship with God then why does so many people find the need to selectively interpret and choose what God intentions will is in the Bible
@anox thefighter  its really hard to pinpoint the meaning of every word sentence that God said in the Bible. that book is thousands of years old and has come through different translations. the 1st and real versions are absolutely hard to understand since it uses of course an old system of writing that everyone in their generation would understand that is why readers today should be careful upon reading the scriptures. speaking of the Bible being translated through generations that passed  there have been records of some sentences  words  or a whole verse that has been either mistranslated  intentionally been changed  or removed from the book  and they were ordered by the higher-ups from the different branches of religion to cater what they understand and their very own favors.as a Christian  it is really sad to see how other believers have to argue about a meaning of a single verse  a verse that came from translations of translations  and most likely have tampered  from the first written scripture.
@skrydon  in my opinion God is omnipresent and omnipotent which means not only he created gaming he also is gaming in a sense  it is in my opinion left to the person to find their own way to navigate this world and find ways to do good with what he gives us. now this is not to say gaming is holy it is as unholy as alcohol or any other substance that we find in nature  but hey thats my opinion and I am also of the opinion that others my have a different way and that is fine.
yep  I was a kid during that. wasn t allowed to play magic the gathering  d d. it wasn t just a thing among Christians either  I had non-Christian friends whose moms were the same way. it was such a weird time.
@aurumfae  thats a good way to look at it! I agree!
@eldritch animation  for sure! I remember the democrats at the time not being any great fans of d d either. they got kinda drowned out and spoken over by the religious types but they were around too. I remember a guidance counselor who was definitely a liberal being concerned that  we know that d d is just make-believe  and  we shouldn t try to act out any sword fights or anything . I d take being smacked with a Bible again over that uncomfortable conversation! lol
@max master j  seems like I remember democrats being involved in the panic as well. they werent that far off from each other in the 90 s. and the whole panic was kicked off by pop psychologists claiming they could recover suppressed memories. pop psych is still popular on both sides today.  Im sure plenty of people remember the censorship of music at the time as being pushed by republicans but tipper gore was right out at the head of the pack. there was plenty of stupid to go around.
@max master j  and Im sure youre right in regards to her remembering it. im slightly younger and I remember jack chick s craziness in particular and the panic itself. found a newly printed chick tract on a jobsite years ago and it kind of blew my mind they were still around.
same here. I dropped Christianity due to bad experiences. a priest from my church actually came up to me and said that playing video games is satanic. he also said thatsmoking is satanic. Im not a smoker  but my parents are. that very day I decided that Christianity can go screw itself. my parents eventually went back to it  but not me. religion has caused more problems in this world than any war or politician ever. its also filled with hypocrites. and when a person with mental problems takes on religion then the results are often times catastrophic. there are also many people who take what their religion teaches way too literal. I understand that a lot of people need something to believe in  and if religion works for them then thats great. its just not for me. I dont need some man-made building to believe in or pray to God  and I dont need some flawed human being  such as a priest  judging me when their sins are ten times worse. a lot of religions today have become more like cults than anything.
yeah  she probably remembers at least towards the end of the satanic panic. but I referring more to the b.a.d.d. days when everybody thought satanists were literally ready to ambush your kids. there were actually people who believed thatsatanists were infiltrating police forces and the like. ever see the stallone movie  cobra   like that.I dont know if this part was nationwide or just in my local area but... I remember them not letting us out of school one day because a van had been spotted in the area and there was a concern that it could be satanists looking to kidnap kids. real insane stuff. there were multiple times stuff like that went down. thank God that I lived with my grandparents and that they had the good sense to realize thatstuff was crazy and stupid.edit  and the right-wing puritans weren t treated as insane at first. that didn t come until the 90s.
yep... same here too.  my mom took Christianity to a cult like level
@aurumfae  my mother is this way. best way I can describe it is she thinks she has the right to be the judge rather than the Lord. Ive told her-  I know Ive sinned  Ive said my prayers of apologies  I have no weight on my shoulders because I know the Lord forgives  and the idea of that just drives her nuts she thinks people have to  pay for their sins also she still believes to this day that pokemon is  satanic  because  all powers come from the Lord or satan  but then I say  so is superman satanic too   and then I get yelled at.
did she calculate thac0 before she did it
I d argue hitting someone with a Bible is worse than playing d d even if the panic were entirely correct. thats disrespectful to scripture. personally I find some of the material in early d d a bit questionable  but thats where being a parent and talking to your kids comes in. not freaking out and overreacting.
@cobalt-snake  whoa there  hypocrite. you just did a lot of judging right there. if this post were newer I d happily discuss the entire thing  but quite bluntly your entire complaint is hypocritical and self-defeating. Im surprised it didn t occur to you when you complained about judging then turned right around and made your own judgements. you cant have it both ways.
the job of a pastor is to help guide people to find truth in the word not to define that truth by their own standards. I dont blame pastors for making those mistakes  its not an easy thing to accomplish especially within denominations that require certain beliefs be held or risk being cast out.
this is one of the reasons I love jordan peterson. he speaks about the Bible based solely on its contents and gives his best interpretation from the perspective of a psychologist. you dont have to treat his interpretation as fact  but at least what he s saying is based on what the Bible says and not something pulled from his behind.
@mr. niu si  that would be sam harris
when I hit my 20s  I decided to go back and read up on a lot of things that were causing conflicts and issues with Christians at the time  like late 00 s early 10 s I read from the literal translation  which just translates literally  duh  from the hebrew and greekI was blown away by how many things were different. its actually pretty wild to see how many tweaks and  creative liberties  translators have taken with the Bible over the yearsnot to mention the shellshock I felt after looking into who actually compiled what we know as the Bible  and when they did itlotta people have got a lot twisted  thats for sure
this!
please mention facts because feelings are deceitful and can be wicked.or as proverbs says  the heart is deceitful and wicked. so who can know it  .but your sentences below that opening sentence are correct.
thats more to do with if you have an internal or external locus of control  and we can all make society better by starting with ourselves  but also still demanding a better ran society too.
yess!
Im not religious in the slightest but I still love videos from mel like this.Imight not believe in God but I definitely believe in a lot of the lessons different scriptures try to deliver.  taking ownership for ones own actions is definitely something I support.
youre really such an amazing person melonie! I had no idea I would blessed with such insightful and knowledgeable content upon subscribing. Im almost beyond words. Im excited to see what the future holds for you.edit  especially grateful for the references to scripture and Christian teachings as well. incredible.
as a fellow Christian and someone who recently got into fitness. I think showing your progress is a good thing and even self motivating to continue. keep it going
I appreciate so much that youre not afraid to delve into these topics on a channel that is not explicitly religious in nature  and is actually very focused on current culture. it can be really hard in culture now to speak freely about religious topics  really regardless of ones beliefs  atheist or theist  without fear of some kind of blowback. as Christians its important for us to not shy away from telling the truth  but that doesnt make it easy to do so.
great biblical coverage and insightful perspectives  melonie. thank you for covering it.  d
I actually appreciate you being harsh but fair on both sides. you focus on the person and dont just say  this one thing is bad therefore all people or things associated with it are bad . thank you.
being someone who has struggled with porn addiction  I know tmI  I cant stop listening to this. thank you mel for supporting a lot of us out there who are trying to get better.
great intro. Im really glad you bring religion into your videos. its no coincidence that I found you when I did because  as someone who struggles with lust  I really needed to hear this. God bless.
awww thanks so much for the shout out  melonie! looks like people like the intro! great video! I absolutely agree with your takes here!
I am really loving your videos and your perspective. I feel like Im learning a lot and also feel validated because I have learned I share similar views to you on many things. you even have me considering going back to church  which I haven t done in a decade since I d interlinked it in my head to my toxic family.
just wanted to say  so glad I found your channel! originally just tuned in for some tr content  but youre a very outspoken person with refreshing takes on things! keep it up
what a great podcast today. my church recently finished a multi-week sermon on sexuality and covered the same verses on lust. anyhow  I appreciate your take. I often cringed at the topic because when I got into photography  I was regularly taking photos of women at the beach in bikinis. and I have photographed nudes as well. there is a battle between the fun of photography  art  and wanting to not create some thing people can abuse or feel uncomfortable with. no one wants to be negatively judged for things they enjoy doing. but we also need to make sure the things we enjoy are not sinful. anyhow  thank you for sharing this. I enjoyed it.
I love this channel so much! God bless you melonie for your great work you do and I hope your day is a good one
you are an amazing young woman. keep to your beliefs and keep sharing! the world needs more people like you... thanks  for all your content and for standing your ground with belief.
Ive been fortunate in my dating experience in the sense the girls Ive dated haven t been individuals who d share anything and everything online  they weren t unattractive so that wasn t the cause lmao. if youre in a relationship  I personally think online modesty is required for all parties  male   female. the second you start sharing  sexy pics  online it implies availability  whether intended or not. if you want to take pics celebrating your body etc  keep them to yourself and significant other. I wouldn t say thats  puritanical . I wouldn t walk around town with my todger hanging and when the police tried to arrest me for indecent exposure then turn around and say  hey  Im just celebrating my penis  Im not flashing!  privacy is something to be cherished and yet people do their damnedest to throw it away these days  that I find truly staggering.
love the intro melonie mac. it was amazing and awesome. glad you got some much support. no prob always will support
this is so hard for me I admit here. its hard not to get others to see how difficult it is for me and resisting is incredibly hard. not trying to illicitsomething as a sheer way to get help with resisting my struggle is hard not to do.
Im loving this new channel. thank you for the consistent uploads! we re living a clown world.
wow.  dont even know where to begin on this.  I really needed to hear this today.  I just...really needed to hear it.  sometimes the voice Im not expecting is the one that resonates when its most important.  thank you.  there s really not room to write it all out.  you keep doing what youre doing.
I think a lot of society has gone away from personal responsibility  it is always someone else s fault. when we make ourselves admit our own faults we can work to be better and turn things around.
people can become addicted to so many different things  the world we live in is full of all sorts of temptations. everyone has their weaknesses and things that they struggle with in life. I think one of the most important things we can do is realize what those struggles are  what our weaknesses are  and try to find ways to control them.  none of us will ever be perfect  but we can all strive to be better.
Im so happy you appreciated my video. we all fall short in our own ways so dont beat yourself up. God bless you
@melonie mac go boom  thanks  saw you on twitch earlier too  how was your lasagna
we all fall short and have our own stuggles  you are trying and that matters. we all need a savior because we all fall short in some way or another. God bless
Im 100  on board with you going this direction with a channel. we need more channels like this. sadly  the woke crowd does not take kindly to such discussions happening from a logical perspective that uses reasoning. considering multiple attempts have been made in the past to cancel you  I would be inclined to suggest you look into at least one alt tech platform to put your message and content on. youtube has this weird tendency to  accidentally  shut down channels that do nothing wrong and not having an alternate means of communicating with your subscribers only stands to hurt yor reach which  in my opinion  is exactly why they do it. it puts you into a category where the algorithm puts you at an automatic disadvantage because your numbers aren t high enough to defeat their algorithm.totally your choice  Im a nobody. but your message and perspective is really refreshing and I d hate to see you suppressed early on. this point in your channel growth is critical. looking forward to the future of this channel and I hope for nothing but the best! the intro is great. I totally forgot jayjay the jetplane existed until you made it a thing and this intro here is epic
to be honest mel  I totally loved that into. if I finally have time between work  school  going for 3d animation   and stuff like that would you mind if Imade something fun that you might use as an intro  no charge of course.as a Christian myself  I have met plenty of people that are too  but there is some that I once called brothers  that never were there in my time of need when I was in a crisis and I have resented them ever since. from that day I have vowed never to needlessly abandon people that are like family to me  whether they are by blood  people that have been there in my darkest hours and even people across the seas that are like brothers and sisters to me from all walks of life that have kept me from self destructive tendencies.to be honest you should keep these up  because as you mentioned  in the long term  you dont need gamestop  twitter or whatever and you can do anything you want and you have people that will listen to your message. actually I have been interested in what routine you do  so that I can replicate it  not just for myself  but to also help my girlfriend  because she let herself go from fear. I am not at liberty to discuss on what it  but I want her to be proud of herself over time and I want to help her to get to her goal  because she s the first woman in my life that makes me feel whole. even if we butt heads at times. what happens when you have a norse man that loves an irish woman. lmao!
wow  I was not expecting this from you when I subscribed.  I am thoroughly uplifted by this video.  I needed this today.  God works in mysterious ways melonie!!
this reminds me of my own journey.  I was raised catholic  and I distinctly remember a mass where the monsignor mentioned sex and wanting to stop it...  I know my memory is being viewed through the warped tween mind  but the gist was thatsentiment.  I did move away from the church at that point to a baptist youth group...  that also had its own problems.I disengaged from organized religion once I was a full on teenager  and I realized that my relationship with God is a personal one  and no other person can help me with that  especially those within organized religion  who dont practice what they preach  read  hypocrites .  I do not condemn people who find comfort in organized religion  but its not for me.puritanical practices on either side should be rejected.  keep up the fantastic work!
keep preaching. never seen a video with such truth and humor on top of it. never fail to entertain.. keep doing you my dude.
originally here from the quartering s channel. I actually recently returned to the faith after being reached out by an evangelical church. I really appreciate the Bible verses  and I think they will help me develop my own relationship with God. my church actually has strict views on modesty and purity  almost more for men than women  I have been been told at church to do my top button   and some other brothers in Christ have claimed thatshowing off muscles is wrong for those sorts of reasons. having scripture to back my reservations about this will be helpful.I suppose that the other side is that  covering up  is a means to not flaunt an attractive body which in many cases could be a sign of wealth the way jewelry was in the time 1 peter was written. what would be your response to the idea that one s body is akin to jewelry referred to in 1 peter 3 3-4
the way a person dresses is a form of self expression.  like art  it can mean different things to different people.  I try not to be judgemental when I see someone dressed immodestly  but it concerns me sometimes because women have always been under a lot of pressure to keep their appearances  just right .  I just hope they know that their looks aren t the only thing about them that have value.
some really good things I think a lot of us needed to hear. awesome show.
one thing I still remember and practice from my days as a latter-day saint is the reminder about agency.  we almost always always have a choice  be it to download pubg or lust after a gal because of her outfit at the time... and what action is taken after that decision is made.
I really enjoy and appreciate how you rationally back your views with scripture  digging well into the word!
brilliant video! even not being a Christian myself I found it extremely interesting and enlightening  I have always found the Bible to be a powerful book that we all can learn from  I find problem when people attach their own opinions and interpretations to it claiming it to be the absolute truth. keep on trucking!!
amen!... so often  the context of scripture is manipulated  rather intentionally  or not  to fit a narrative that diminishes the beauty and complexity of God s creation...thank you for tackling this topic!... I know that your decision was not made lightly. as a man and a father  I can appreciate a content creator who acts as the spirit moves and not as the world dictates. know that God is using your voice in powerful ways. thank you for your bravery and commitment to truth.
yay! good one. I live my life in bikinis. I surf  scuba  play with my children in the sand. last thing I want is someone telling me Im sinning by dressing this way.
2 44 dude. problematic was a word I used waaaay before the wokies used it not to use the way they do but I would always say it with a british accent and it would make girls laugh.. and now some of the those girls are like total sjws and I wonder if I had a hand in the nightmare that is the ruining of that word    seriously the girl I used to hang with and I would say that the most to when making jokes about things is straight up short unnatural haired non-binary in a  civil partnership  with someone else who is non-binary. before all this woke crap she was a goth girl who was very mentally troubled.  which is just one of the little things that tell me a lot of this woke stuff tends to be taken to heart by people with anxiety depression issues the most  ..
I have always been bothered by a lot of protestant church s views on meditation. mindfulness  as a practice  helps me distinguish between the  real me  and the constant barrage of wayward thoughts. the immorality comes not from the wayward thought but from the willful and deliberate rumination on that thought. great video!
you seem to have found your  internet  calling with this channel. so much content in such a short amount of time compared to what Im used to from you. and with a point of view only melonie mac can provide.
when you get down to it  drug addiction would count as lust  because lust has very little to do with sexual desire  but it does have a great deal to do with desire in of itself. in other words its kind of the longing for something that makes it a problem...kind of reminds me a bit of covetous in an indirect way.
as a fellow Christian  I think you worded this very well. thanks for posting.
dear melonie you are awesome. keep going forever  the world needs good people like you. otherwise humanity would suck.
thank you melonie. as an south european catholic  I felt your words were full of wisdom.
yea  why would anyone strive to be pure ! gross...
love it! keep rocking it  girl!
thatsounds like a happy life and your kids will have nice memories of playing with their mom on the beach.
just be you! fuck everybody
@starsiegeplayer  thanks.
it depends on where you wear it. on the beach of course to wear a bikinI isn t bad since thats where its supposed to be worn. go to church in one is something different though  of course one has to wear what is appropriate in it.
@milliardo5  lol  I live in hawaii. and yeah I have been to an outdoor church in flip flop  cut offs and tank top with my bikinI underneath. and half the congregation dresses like that.
@shandI nicole beard  I would love to visit a church like that  I grew up going to churches where they were so big on  modesty .
this in every way! melonie  your video is one example why Im not welcomed in any church in my area. I dont cherry pick God s word.
youre killin it melonie - thanks for the video!
came here from the quartering  Im blown away  was not expecting this level of amazing spiritual content. it is refreshing.one of my favorite Christian content providers is dr. michael heiser. you should check him out if you haven t already. he exegetes those  modesty  passages and has some fascinating things to say concerning where they came from  from a greek cultural perspective  in a nutshell the greco roman world had some very bizarre superstitions . heiser is really good on explaining  hard  passages that most pastors are like  so this is really weird  so let s just skip it   as they dont understand it.  if its weird  its important  he says.anyway  love the channel. keep up the great work.
preach sister. it is funny how quickly the word can be twisted by those with bias or bad intent. when we leave the message of personal responsibility for our relationship with Jesus and our father  along with the responsibility for our sin  we are decoupling ourselves from the truth. the word is about the individual. not the collective.
this reminds me of the lecrae song church clothes. I remember hearing about how there is a science study thatsays that both men and women do look at the female body objectively. even got a friend who used to be a nfl cheerleader  who confirmed that yeah..  everyone and their mother does it .  she told me that after I had told her I had no interest of seeing her in a  male gaze    objectivity  basically my point to this  is its a sin of the flesh to lust after someone  its our morals that tell us its wrong. its your choice on what to do about it  on which to follow. do you give in to sin and lust  or do you fight the temptation and rise above it  I hope what I said is understood that I am not saying women need to cover up  or that objectification is alright because its natural  or anything like that. all Im saying is who do you listen to  the devil on your shoulder telling you to  want  a person  or the angel that tells you its wrong
melanie  giving the benefit of the doubt to that pastor  I  think  his message was  dont feel you have to     which I agree with. a person should never feel pressured into feeling that must share intimate details of their lives on social media. there s so much click chasing  like chasing  and clout chasing that often it leads us to places that we never would have ventured otherwise. anyway  thats my two cents. take care.
oh. my. God. that intro! bwahahahahah! perfect! excellent vod  mel! agreed with everything you said!
glad to see the ranks of the fellowship expanding. looking forward to you on fnt
as a man of the agnostic persuasion I can say its always a delight to hear the opinion of a Christian that doesnt rely on pedantic adherence to the lines of what I consider to be a book of mythology. within every faith lies a kernel of the universal truth  in my opinion.
what you discussed is one of the many things that pushed me away from church but not Christianity.  because I whole heartedly agree with what you are saying.  I think that a lot of the message is getting lost especially these days.
brian could ve had a great message especially if he worded it better especially for the younger gen on tiktok. you explained it perfectly.
that return of the jedI intro  absolutely awesome!!
greetings from croatia !!!!   I saw in your voice that youreally care about this topic.because it is easier to guide Christians  sinners  from the influence of sin if they do not see the temptation.rather than being personally responsible in Christ to resist lust  each of us individually . perhaps that is the role of the pastor to lead his flock as far away from temptation as possible.may God keep you safe!!!
never let fear stop you  good message.
if it was incumbent upon women to dress to eliminate lust I d feel pity. some women could wear a box and be attractive. Im going to recommend you to my wife and sister. a wise female voice is always needed  especially in times like these. keep up the great work. think of how many people are praying for you now.... God bless.
yo...... as if I didn t already love ya  so refreshing to see someone speak about their faith with conviction. I came here because of jeremy  I am coming back every day because of you.
I think you might enjoy melissa dougherty for biblical teaching. not only is she funny and knowledgeable but she gives historical context to verses like the ones you covered and she can backup everything she says with scripture.
the Christian culture idea that women dressing modestly is supposed to help men not sin is something Ive struggled with figuring out over the years and seeing it laid out here has been very helpful. it is true  sin is a personal choice  whether through our thoughts or actions and at the end of the day is our responsibility alone. it reminds me of a story a good friend told me about how she was sexually assaulted when she was in her mid-teens after a shift at her job. she went on to tell me that her mother had practically beat it into her head that girls should dress modestly  in her mom s mind  that meant next to no skin showing below the neck  wrists  or ankles  because if she didn t  men would lust after her. my friend then tearfully asked me if such a thing were the case  then why did her boss at her job assault her when she was wearing jeans and a turtleneck sweater. a damn good question.
I like how they say we cant sexualize women in comics and other forms but they re the ones viewing them in this light
they want the same thing  but they present it differently.  horseshoe theory in a peanut m m shell.
that really means a lot - thank you
its a shame her mom was so nasty to her own daughter terrible mother.Im sorry for your friend  and it was never her fault. evil is as evil does.
@aurumfae  out of respect for my friend s confidence  I cant speak more on the topic but her mom was more horrible than you could know.
my issue is with women  or men  but not applicable in my case  who get mad at you for how you look at them  or want to control someone else s thoughts perceptions of them.  you are not entitled to my thoughts.  it goes both ways.  while it is not your  fault  if someone lusts after you  actions have consequences.  when you choose to wear something revealing  you are making it more likely for others to lust after you.  wear what you want  Im gonna keep looking.  if that makes you uncomfortable  thats on you.  its not  she wouldn t dress like that if she didn t want to be assaulted.   its  she wouldn t dress like that if she didn t want you to look.   Im in for that unspoken contract.  wear something revealing  and I will look.  transaction complete.
I was essentially going to say the same thing as nick above.  you control your own self.  blaming women for your lack of control is so typical of our current culture and lack of moral teaching in the home.  your a good kid melonie and even though I dont know you I am proud of you.
that intro is amazing!!! thank you for this channel.
regarding modesty  I think there s obviously two sides to it  self control is important  but one cant be an occasion of sins for others either. a lot of the issue comes from nowadays inability to distinguish beauty from sex-appeal  the former being good and the latter bad. women  and men  are not just allowed but encouraged to be beautiful without making holiness harder for others.
thank you for talking about such a sensitive subject.  I do agree with most of what you are saying with a few caveats.  I ll leave this verse first for context romans 14 21it is good not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything that causes your brother to stumble.while I 100  agree that the sin is in the heart of the sinner and cannot be blamed on another  we must also be careful as to not become a stumbling block to others.  this doesnt necessarily mean you have to follow a strict modest dress codes at all times  rather that we ought to be sensitive to our surroundings especially if we are aware that there may be particular individuals thatstruggle with lust in our presence.it isn t up to us to take responsibility for the wandering eyes and thoughts of another  yet we can also choose to present ourselves in such a way that is respectful.it is absolutely true that the sin exists in the heart of the individual.  once again  we cannot be held responsible for another s sins.  along with that  however  we must ask ourselves  men and women alike  what the sins of our hearts are.  if you or I internally desire to illicit lust from other s  whether by how we dress act or behave  we are committing our own sin as well.  let s be honest  to feel lusted after can be a big ego boost.I do still feel its important to evaluate ourselves and question our own motivations and desires.  we may not be responsible for another s sin  but we can certainly become complicit.
one of my favorite videos is  good for you  I think dressing up for others is like a gift or respect  idk
your doing what ive wanted to do  but had no platform. Godbless you!
hey  you bought a pop filter! glad to see that jeremy s advice was useful.
its not just a hatred of men  its a hatred of heterosexuality and feminine beauty. women can be lusted after  but only by other women. the fact that us tomboys have to constant speak up about this is wild  lol  -p
yeah my dad started this with my sisters on puritan standards  and because the girls where the same age as my sisters  the girls older where grabbing at with guard down temping me I was no longer suppose be around them the gullible_little_boy_toy_me made me want stop playing tomb raider games  and wanting admire girls sports  or worrying about the girl hero s in   anime like watch censored verison of sailor moon  or charmed  all because my family puritans standards
the leftist sjw modern feminist puratinism is self-evidently ridiculous  and its been commented on to death at this point in recent memory  but I grew up in the  right wing  evangelical Christianity with many of their own attitudes about this  or at least I lived in close enough proximity to notice   akd I think I have a little something worth saying about it. the whole  purity ring promise ring  culture in some evangelical communities has a lot of these issues you described  and its really weird when taken to extremes. there s definitely an air of self-righteousness about it where they have their own form of virtue signaling like what atheistic sjw leftists do on twitter. just like on twitter  the louder someone preaches and virtue signals about sexual purity in front of everybody  the more likely they probably are to be an absolute horndog  maybe even an outright degenerate actively trying to cover up their unrepentant behavior. they re like the mirror inverse of the male feminists...
great video today! love watching with my wife and daughter!
Ive seen outfits that cover skin have more effect than some cleavage or thigh showing.  its about intent.  if you stare and lust its on you not them.
I would not to live in a world where women were not allowed to be feminine and sexy. my wife is hyper feminine  and can still stop me in my tracks when she chooses to. feminine is not weakness  it is a strength all onto itself. however  it is a power thatshould be wielded appropriately. yes  we men should always exert self control  but the same is also true for women. God made us equal and discerning. thank you for your demonstration of faith and common sense.
Christian army brat here - thanks for this. keep doing you woman.
as someone who came to Christ in the early 2000s and saw  purity culture  up close  Ive seen what happens when the gospel of grace is not applied on this subject matter and you see Christians fall into either legalism or licence. even more heartbreaking is seeing many of the top inffluencers at the time now  deconstruct  and abandonthe faith. here s a vlog I did on joshua harris  deconstruction  https   youtu.be xg2ougybrbwbut please make more videos like this! have you also considered doing videos that look at the storylines of popular games from a Christian perspective
I am not one bit religious but I really appreciate those references. Imay not be religious but the Bible is a very important part of my culture and seeing it referenced fills my heart with pride.  God would probably not like that but what can I do...
I assume jessica rabbit is the next drawing to be redrawn in a more androgenous style. God  Im giving them ideas...
I show pics of my abs  but I dont dress provocatively. thats not my intent.  I think you hit the nail with that line. modesty is more about intent than it is about what is worn.  for God judges the heart.  you are not responsible for my sin  only yours. if a man or woman dresses in such a way as to provoke lust in another  then they sin against them. I have been in churches before where men and women both dressed to garner the interest of members of the opposite sex  and they have rightly been rebuked for that. but for the most part  people dont dress provocatively  especially in church.another spot-on video melonie. self-control is a virtue. but many people have forgotten that fact. we all too easily blame those around us for our sins. we need to do more in the church about dealing with lust  and less fretting about what men or women are wearing.
that intro was hilarious. well done !!
bit of a history lesson  but I think it adds to the point of the video. Jesus wasn t actually saying anything new with his  if you look at a woman with lust  comment as many believe  and some of the common interpretations of what he means  although not entirely off base  are also a product of this kind of sexually repressed neuroticism that appears so often in some more conservative forms of Christianity throughout history that you were mentioning  speaking as a conservative leaning Christian btw . a bit of the misunderstanding has to do with the meaning being a bit lost in translation when the scribes and translators interpreted  woman  the way they did  probably in part because of their own subconscious biases. from what I understand  the word used for  young woman  and  wife  were often used interchangeably in the original languages  and which way its used depended on the context of what was being said  no different than in english with a word like  love   for example . I think this night have a lot to do with the fact that women were typically betrothed and married fairly young  certainly not prepubescant child grapist muhammed young  but probably betrothed in their teens and married by their mid-late teens to early 20s young   and the only women who could generally afford to remain independently single apart from the protection and authority of her family without being dangerously poor and vulnerable to exploitation were those who were more well off. the reason it was translated  woman  is because it is  technically  correct  but itsomewhat deprives the text of its full context. the reason why its better understood as  wife  instead of  woman  is because Jesus wasn t introducing a  more strict  command any more than he was being more strict when he denounced hatred when talking about murder. he was referencing the 10th commandment. do not covet  or envy plot to steal  that which rightfully belongs to someone else  be thatsomeone s land  their wealth and possessions  their status or social standing  their wife  and so on  certainly this applies equally for women not to covet another woman s husband  but Jesus was talking to men here . certain jewish religious leaders of the time believed that the sin is only in the technical action itself and would often look for loopholes to get away with committing adultery and putting away divorcing their wives on illegitimate grounds so they could justify chasing every other piece of tail that caight their eye when they got bored with their wives  among other hypocritical excuse and legalistic argument they used to justify their bad behavior   but in reminding them of the 10th commandment  Jesus reminded them thatsin at its core is a problem of the human heart which begins in the mind when you determine within yourself to do something you know you shouldn t. the reason translators were more inclined toward using the word  woman  here instead of  wife  is  I think  because there is an element of Christian culture and history that has really repressed sexual attitudes and sometimes has less than savory attitudes toward women in rare extreme cases as you already discussed  though never anywhere near how bad it gets in conservative islam  and certainly nothing approximating the caricature of the handmaid s tale .  Im no feminist as a general rule  but some things some classical Christian teachers said and taught about women and sex are cringe to say the least  sometimes unambiguously wrong and un-Christian altogether. some Christians often implicitly adopt some of these attitudes you criticized in the video  I think  as a byproduct of the heretical influence of gnostic thinking about the material world and neoplatonist philosophy that had such a strong influence  both for good and bad  I think  on elements of early classical Christian thought that resulted in some really weird  unnecessarily strict  and sometimes messed up ideas thatseeped into various Christian communities at different points throughout history. some of those weird ideas were that eve was primarily or even exclusively responsible for the fall of mankind while minimizing adam s role  which was essentially adam s excuse that God didn t accept and shut down immediately   that women in general were the cause of all sin and temptation in the world  at least one patristic father said that  but I think most people never really took that too seriously and generally tried to ignore that it was ever said in the first place   that even sexual thoughts and feelings for your spouse are sinful  thatsexual pleasure is inherently bad and thatsex can never be had for pleasure  even with your spouse  thatsexual activity can only be done for purely necessary reproductive purposes  that you cant have sex on certain days of the week like on ritually scheduled fast days  religious feast days  during lent  or the night before taking communion eucharist if you want to live a holy life  that only the most clinical  vanilla sex was the only acceptable sexual act  that eve s original sin was actually having sex with satan the serpent  or whatever it actually was   and thatsexual desires and needing to engage in sexual activity to reproduce was an  unfortunate  bypriduct of the curse on the natural world brought on by the spiritual fall of humanity. as a result of this kind of mindset that has appeared and persisted to varying degrees among some Christians  thats how we get this idea that literally any sexual thought about a perfectly eligible  single woman  or man for that matter  is inherently sinful even though romantically desiring and pursuing someone with the intention of eventually having them sexually is literally a fundamental part of how mate selection and reproduction works in order to perpetuate civilization and the human race... to be fair  there s a valid point to be made that you obviously shouldn t have so little self control over your thoughts and actions that you just indiscriminately go around sexually fantasizing about and getting off on every person of the opposite sex that you find attractive  that lack of discipline is just not healthy for functional  proper human relationships and could easily lead you to actual sinful behavior through your careless indescretion   but still  this interpretation can and often does lend itself to a lot of the sexually repressed neuroticism that you see in certain elements of Christianity that not even the Bible itself actually prescribes. in contrast  its interesting how theres literally a book of spiritual  erotic love poetry  song of solomon or song of songs  with a loooot of  not exactly vanilla  sexual innuendo that is used in a celebratatory manner to both describe the romance between king solomon and one of his wives and to symbolize the nature of divine love and union with God. thankfully  I think these attitudes have lessened over the years  and when confronted with some of the old ideas that have gone out of fashion  for good reason   even the most conservative Christians are often surprised and find it absurd  but some of the consequences and leftover inferences of that kind of thinking do still persist in various ways. ironically  we use  puritannical  to describe this stuff  but to my understanding  the puritans  though they were fairly radical in other ways  weren t quite the sexual prudes they are made out to be. they were super strict about only having sex within the confines of marriage and strongly encouraged marrying fairly young as a result so that their young people could have a healthy outlet for their normal sexual desires  anf they had their own courtship rules and rituals  but they didn t really have a lot of the strict rules and ideas that institutions like the roman catholic church sometimes historically imposed on people within marriage  though. so long as it was done within marriage and you weren t publicly indecent about it  to my understanding  pretty much anything was fair game. kids weren t allowed to be born out of wedlock  and homosexuality  bestiality  and adultery weren t tolerated  but sexual experimentation among young people who were courting wasn t treated like the end of the world  so long as you married if or when the girl got preggo   and puritan preachers even espoused ideas like  duty to desire  one s spouse. say what you want about some of their other ideas  but they had positively good attitudes about healthy sexuality within committed relarionships. once a dude even got excommunicated because he refused to have sex with his wife. they believed eager and regular sex was important to maintaining a healthy marriage. this is why  even though frontier survival could be difficult and there was a lot of childhood and infant mortality for a while there  the population of the british colonies and early america grew as much as it did for so long. basically everyone was the duggars and everyone having sex were trying to breed like rabbits.
aw thank you

I cant speak for God  but I dont think he would have any issue with anyone appreciating the Bible. good on you
that intro literally made me lol  I love it!
Im 50. back in my day.... the green m ms were the specific ones you gave your girlfriend because they had a meaning. cue the  let s get it on  by marvin gaye. the original green m m embodied that meaning. I guess she transitioned.
thanks for making this channel.  your tiktok videos were too short  but they were good.
hoho  youre really going boom in very heavy topics  not the woke nonsense . I feel the intent on wearing  spicy  clothing is also very important.
I have a minor issue with the term  puritan puritanical  because it misrepresents what the puritans were all about - it was originally used by licentious non-believers to smear Christians. cant fault your usage because of what the term means now but figured I d toss that out there. otherwise  you make some good points. there often seems to be a fine line between not being unfairly held accountable for someone else s sin and not being a stumbling block for them either. there isn t a hard and fast rule  as you point out with the reference to different cultures viewing modesty differently. also glad that you pointed out modesty can also refer to flaunting wealth.
thatsecond pastor s reply was spot on  as are you .  I dont understand how anyone who is supposed to be familiar with the Bible could come to any other conclusion.
its refreshing to see someone so bold about their faith. if Imay  I would like to recommend a listen to tony evans. he has a great youtube channel and is very energetic yet eloquent.
omg I laughed my ass off with that intro ! superb  3
I been following u for over a decade now melo but I feel like I have a newfound love for u
all things are permissible  but not all things are expedient
melonie  this one was a good one ! thank you.
I wish that I could give this more than one thumbs up!
thats the best intro Ive seen yet. you should keep it!  also  can you confirm youre a jet   d
imagine what the empire felt like getting blown up by a ship with a happy human tongue out face on it.
good stuff. very enlightening .
everyone go follow fantasy files!  great podcast and great person
what I dont get is seeing the  free the nipple and sex work is real work  crowds. losing their minds over anime thighs being seen
me watching this video   yeah she is right puritan culture is a problem on both sides and ooooohhhhhh kitty cat! kitty in the background!
hey  I appreciated your use if scriptures in your discussion. thanks!
I see a powerful  confident... m m woman here! you get  em told  mel!
ooh good to know  thank you for the info!
@melonie mac go boom  I gotta justify having all this mostly useless knowledge somehow
I was under the impression that m ms was going to remove the nuts from the yellow m m  give him a thin layer of blue  and call him the green m m.
keep going..... dont stop..... we ll always be here for you.....
the word problematic is now actually problematic itself.
that intro was awesome.
the intro is dope !!!
intro  is decent. almost thought this was another tfm channel
I agree with you up to a point.I however think that when going to church  men and women should dress modestly as to cause no distractions.anyway loved this vid  God bless!
lust is judge frollo during the song  hellfire .
thanks for addressing this topic  you are awesome! I especially take issue with that pastor s comment regarding birth stories or newborn pics. as a pro-life father of 7  I think the most beautiful thing in this world is a pregnant or nursing mother. look at so many renaissance depictions of the blessed mother with the infant Jesus--almost always breastfeeding. if this guy thinks that any exposure of the female body in any context is inappropriate  then he has his own issues to work through!one thing I will say is that when girls  sadly  mostly teenage girls  run around with shorts so short that their butt is hanging out or wear super tight  tiny shirts with their boobs popping out  it is way easier for a man to make that leap from just looking to fantasizing lustfully because he can already see so much  no need to undress with the eyes!   and we know that men are more stimulated aroused visually ... so in a way there is some responsibility for women to help men minimize the potential for lustful thoughts.
that intro is so cool mel!!!!
when you said you were questioning on making this video. Im glad you did. there s alot of Christians such as myself who dispise the woke left. how ever we absolutely do not agree with pastor s such as the example you given. so its people such as myself that do not fit with either group to an extent. I feel alot of Christians morphed the original teachings from the Bible and implying that we need to revert to some bygone age that we have no business revisting. do we need to adjust our values  most certainly. however again these people are taking it too far. again Im glad you did. it assures me that my beliefs are not mine and mine alone. that there are in fact others who agree with me and see these people as problematic.
you said something along the lines of  Ive already talked about this subject a lot . Ive never heard you before so I say talk about whatever  the spirit  brings up.
that beginning clip should be your new standard opener
wonderful content.
that intro made me laugh  its so funny! xd
wasn t expecting a Bible study for my first step into your videos. not a bad thing save scripture makes my skin crawl. as a faithless I have little interest in the material. definitely see the positive aspects of your content. so please keep going. I ll be tuning out though. stopped reading my grandmothers Bible for the same reason.
Im writing this before watching the video.Im in this somewhat unusual middle space.  which I believe is because I had a completely secular life until I became a Christian at 37.Im a Bible believing Christian  as I believe all Christians should be.  personally I believe in three things.- God is perfect- the law of God as described in the Bible is perfect- God is justGod is as merciful as possible without violating his just nature.  I love Christianity because its wise enough to understand only God is good.  and that we are not.  and thatsalvation is not by people but only through Jesus Christ and the gospel.  I hate censorship  like free speech and believe in being able to disagree and get along.  I believe these conditions favor Christianity because we have the truth.  I believe in humor and its health and coping benefits.  I believe humor brings us closer together.I believe in small government and that Christians should not try to impose social conditions through government force.  with the exception of abortion unless it endangers the physical health of the mother because I believe it is murder.  I believe that any punitive abortion measure should punish the mother and the father.  I believe in birth control and taking measures to prevent conception.  Im an advocate for adoption.  we should use debate to explain sin and why itshould be avoided.I believe the best approach to sin is loving honesty.  I believe it is completely un-Christian to hate or discriminate against anyone.  I believe it is completely un-Christian to affirm sin.  this is a stance which requires tact.  our culture sucks at tact.I believe that love covers a multitude of sins.  I believe we should all try to repent and abstain from sin.  I believe we will still sin.  I believe some of us are born more likely to commit certain sins.  I believe you cant outsin God.  but  as a Christian  you should be respectful of God and acknowledge your sin.  this means that we are all sinners and I pray that anyone who accepts the gospel can have Jesus pay for any sin on judgment day.  I believe Jesus bore punishment for every sin on the cross.  I believe Jesus meant it when he said forgive them for they know not what they do.I hope for mercy for as many as possible.  I believe in heaven and hell.finally I believe that you can accept that the only way to be saved is through the gospel and 100  through God s grace without changing your culture.y all this is a gutsy post and Imight be opening myself up for reprisal but thats my honest opinion.  God bless.
avoid the near occasion of sin as much as you are able.
well the point of the adornment issue I believe was that it takes attention away from God to bring it on yourself but that was my take on it.
melonie. keep making good vids. Im very happy that jeremy sent me.
yes I agree  Imentioned that in the tiktok video I showed
wow  that reply from patrick weaver ministries knocked it out of the park.  the original comment was way too close to the idea of blaming a grape victim because of how they were dressed.
excellent video and its a huge help of a video thank you and God bless

that intro was awesome!
the intro is awesome!
that intro
I think people should be mindful of the influence they might have on others.  so certain styles of clothing do cross that line.  but the line varies from person to person  culture to culture  etc. and our job  in this case  the men  is to keep our lines at around a certain level.  so I do think its normal  even healthy  to be aroused by certain styles of clothing.  but seeing a woman in a bikinI really shouldn t make you think about sex if youre born and raised in the u.s.  if it does  you need to work on you  not worry about the woman in your average bikini.
lust is the second glance.
dont really have anything to say on this but commenting for the algorithms. keep it up  chica.

keep rockin
Im from brazil and you made the same point that I do about this moralism. it is the same with fundamentalist religion and the radical feminism  or woke side. for the woke side  they just h a t e men and cant deal with the idea of men getting visual pleasure. for the radical religion side it is essencialy the dont make me sin. but about Bible rules about desire  I dont believe in it anymore. Bible is very puritan and moralist in many ways  the only relationship that Bible allows  even in mind  is on the marriage. this is not a good thing for me anymore. I believe that every relationship between adults with consent is good.
well spoken sister.
it is the exact correct word for it. puritanical. its kind of crazy to see society regress like this. on both sides of the political divide.
I dont have to worry about anyone lusting after me... because Im fat.
thank you
I found if I start straying from the way God wants us to live  I will go to a site that preaches the word of God  and I can listen to their reading scripture. or they are speaking on a topic related to the Bible.  its something that I have a struggle with. so I can always use prayer. thank you all.
this is a very compelling argument. I would be interested in a discussion on whether romans 14 21 and the surrounding context has any application to the discussion. also 1 cor. 10 23-24.
love that intro lol
I agree with most of what you said but we have to have balance in this issue. we are not to be a stumbling block romans 14 13  so I wouldn t purposely drink in front of someone with a drinking problem or dress in a way to make one stumble even though they own their sin.
1 for thatsick intro
I agree with you  although its a nuanced issue. I cantell you  Im personally turned off by women who make their beauty too accessible or apparent. I think a man who really knows beauty can see it even when its not on display  and though Im a man   and Im entitled to my opinion  you dont have to agree  I think that women should want to give a competitive advantage to men who recognize their beauty  or general appeal  without it being made obvious or artificially accentuatedby competitive advantage  Imean like hiding in plain sight from other men and not signaling  with beauty  that your pursuers are going to have a lot of competition. I also think women shouldn t intentionally tease or try to rile up others  whether its making other women jealous or soliciting for male attention. I hold the envious and lustful accountable for their own feelings  but I dont think its right to try  again  intentionally  and cause them to struggle with those sinful impulsesin general  I dont like vanity or intentions to display social value status. it also makes my job harder as a man  of helping fellow men improve morally  when so many women are adept at taking advantage of the pathetic weakness of men against female sexual command. I wish many women weren t that cynical  and instead thought  ugh  I dont want a man who I can manipulate with my beauty  or deceive with my make up and clothing.
love it
Bible and gaming! sweet
being an atheist I do acknowledge the value of having faith in a religion. its like philosophy   do unto others as you would have them do unto you.  treat others the way you want to be treated.
really good video!
15 43 I wanna say this before I hear what youre about to say coz I think maybe we might be about to say the same thing or similar.. just based on what you said leading up on to this point  but when I hear that verse I think just one example if instagram causes you to stumble.. you know lookin at certain kind of things you know what Imean... throw it away..    I think youre right about that  but everyone is different and I think the distinction here is... that you simply cannot make society a certain way because of what  people should do.  because men should control themselves and stop that.. you cant control what people are gonna do. you cant control human nature and not only are there certain men that wont be able to control it but there are also men who dont want to ... control it. Imean you can put  em in jail right but there s gonna be more where that came from  because humans will always have free will. so you can make the choice to just continue trying to fight something you cant control  or you can make changes to what you can control  in order to stop the situation from occurring. which I think is why our ancestors had these rules to begin with.I think actually this is one of the large problems in society is people want to base things on the ideal of humanity as opposed to the reality of humanity. and just say well we shouldn t have to do this.. you shouldn t do that.. dont blame us or try to control us.. youre the one that needs to change.. except its not one person youre talking to its all of humanity. you cannot change human nature.
the same can be said about dressing up for church. I cant tell you how many men  and women dress to the nines for church. Im not saying that you shouldn t dress in your sunday best  but dont dress to impress. God cares more about your heart  and not how sharp you look. he would rather see us dressed up like a hobo with the right heart than someone dressed up to say  look at me  in his heart.
I love that intro  lol.
10 49 the only thing Im going to say about this is Im going to offer a nuanced perspective that is something most people dont see because since human beings are not immortal they typically are only familiar with their time being on this earth. however  it is possible to become familiar with multiple generations of culture. one simple example which is the opposite of the point Im about to make is content creators and streamers.Ive noticed content creators and streamers no matter what age are always exposed to the bleeding edge of pop culture and the latest generations  culture. as well as their own  so they can see both. and in a real way where they actually see it-- not just you know  kids these days are idiots  kind of thing.the Bible may not have anything telling women how to dress but certain back then women did dress in a certain way and if they had worn crop tops it would not be good. there s also a major huge difference between how prostitutes dressed back then and how women dress now. I know for certain few hundred years ago prostitutes then dressed more modestly than a lot of women dress now when they re going out to clubs or whatever or some clothes. if thats just a couple hundred years I can imagine 2000 years.so but my point .. my personal opinion .. I dont really care. I dont have an opinion one way or another personally in terms of how women should dress. what I do know is I can look around and see the effects of contemporary culture on the world at large. Im not just talking about woke-ism but literally everything in our society all the ills and the problems. the marriage problems. the teenage pregnancy problems. the father problems.I was raised Christian but I was completely against all forms of religion  until around 2017 when I saw the damage thatstraying from traditional judeo-Christian values did to our society as a whole  and I see now what I did not see before  the reasons why all those things were in place that I thought were stupid  outdated   harmless.  and something my aunt said will always stick with me coz she s a 70 year old woman.  women shouldn t dress that way and...  I dont remember the exact words of the rest but the gist of it was that its because it arouses men and its just not a good thing.. and the focus was on women not doing that as opposed to men having  self control. a lot of men actually do have self-control. to sort of massage a quote by ben shapiro.. if men didn t have self control  then every time an attractive woman dressed in a sexy way walked by a man we d have a real mess on our hands. but that doesnt happen. you dont have an epidemic of men raping women because of how they re dressed. but what you do have  is a lot of men who have a lot of depression issues because they cant get a girlfriend these days because they re following a rulebook written by feminists which as the years go by it just keeps on adding nails in the coffin of their chances of attracting a woman.men actually cant control their attraction to women any more than women can control theirs and we see every day that womens  attraction that they cannot control leads them into abusive relationships  and if we point that out we get yelled at for  blaming the victim   but its totally cool to blame  the man  for being turned on by women prancing around showing all kinds of skin  and demanding that they somehow control what biology has programmed into them.these are just facts Im laying out here. scientific facts  and also demonstrable facts. women s attractions do often lead them into abusive and dysfunctional relationships with bad men. its a cliche in fact. like I said I dont have any opinion one way or the other on how women dress.but the past few years Ive started to realize that we should maybe respect traditional values and  rules  I guess that have been around for a very long time and realize even if some of them seem ridiculous or some of the stuff people are doing seems  harmless   that our society has been greatly harmed by the abandoning of these things.the one opinion I will share is that the only way to make society good again is to bring traditional values back from the dead on a mainstream level.I saw this old folgers commercial where this family was waking up on Christmas and the smell of coffee woke them up and it was enough to make me almost cry thats how touching it was but its also shown how much society has changed  for the worse  not the better. the slippery slope is real. but some of these topics are like so taboo that you dont express your thoughts if you dont agree with the consensus today because you will be shunned  and I dont mean like the typical woke insult of being called racist. Imean like.. at the very best your  views will be considered extremism by normal people. not just crazies on twitter.so just to summarize dont get me wrong. I dont judge you at all for how you dress. I have just noticed how the completely abandoning of views like that pastor s views have led to where we are now. and we re not in a good place. in my opinion. at all.
that fricking intro meme though.
why aren t you auditioning for comedy roles  you ve got that quirky cute thing in spades.
melonie  thanks for opening this discussion.  I agree with almost everything you said and the references you gave. especially with the part from mr weaver! the sin of the sinner is their problem!what I didn t see discussed in greater detail is the Christian s obligation to protect their brothers   sister in Christ.  you glossed to this in the example respecting other cultures  10 25   but I think even there you should consider the overall impact on your brother and sister.this is clearly laid out by paul in 1 cor 8 1-13.  verses 9-13 are the meat of the discussion. to paraphrase  if you are doing anything that causes your weaker brother to sin  you are sinning yourself  both against your brother and Christ  . this does go against your tictok statement  10 05 .mr suave didn t help his message any by taking the  never  approach.  I fully agree that there are appropriate times to dress various ways. and maybe mr suave himself is lost in weeds and just focused on modesty and the lack thereof as the sin iteself  Im not him I cant say. but I think that his message would been better saying starting of with  dont encourage your brothers   sister to stumble.  you may be strong in your faith and able to handle it but that doesnt make it right when it directly affects them . this removes the hard line of  never   but does mean that you being the stronger brothers or sister should be aware enough take steps to not cause them to stumble.  again great topic and glad you are out there and having this discussions.
love the intro.
the Bible says a lot of things  but God knows we all fall short. the challenge is to be better than our failings.personally for me Im not into girls with tattoos  but you have such a personality I could over look those.the Bible does tell women to dress modestly  but this is to be applied to men as well. but really depends on the situation  like you said youre not going to wear a crop top to church. well neither should guys wear shorts or jeans  one should dress respectfully. but no one expects you to wear a dress or a suit to a gym or at the beach  thats just crazy. it all has to do with the situation and the event.
I have never drooled over an m m. now if they make a sexy reeses Imake no promises. after all  I ll want a peeses of that.
praying for you
@melonie mac go boom  thank you!
so true! I love that my church is so chill - I wear a hoodie and jeans. my pastor wears jeans and a t shirt or polo. its great!
the other thing is the first thing I thought when I read that pastor s tweet  because I used to be a life coach. but I dunno if thats how he meant itso I didn t want to assume  but the first thing I thought was  he s right  women dont need to do that  to feel self worth    and thats pretty much another major problem is you have men and women doing all kind of things with the sole purpose of  feeling good  because they feel very bad and have a very low self worth. and one of the easiest ways for women to get positive attention from men is to post pictures of themselves the way that the pastor mentioned.. but of course.. he probably didn t mean it like that. the only reason thats the first thing I think of is because my mind is always seeing things in the context of self-empowerment.
as a Christian and a man we shouldn t blame lust on how a woman dressed. if a man looks at a woman and has inappropriate fantasies about her thats his fault not her s.
I am from the quartering camp. I always hated the way that the church is all women at responsible for men s mistakes. especially when its younger like in church camp. was raised Christian went to the lutheran church they would always rail in about how women couldn t wear this or should be more modest. modesty was a Christian value for everyone. no one is responsible for your sin. Im reminded of a certain john 8 7.
17 54 dude we both said exactly the same thing lol. there s also another perspective here.. if guys do do that and like avoid women who dress in a way that gets them all hot and bothered.. what s that do to those women who now are not getting the attention from the men who are now following this advice
I am a Christian and I do agree that both men and women have a degree of responsibility such as men should keep themselves in check and to not stumble for women to be self-respectful in areas where they should dress more appropriately such as church  work  schools  college  and ect... if there are any points to be made to my comment please say something I ll be open to hear
m   m s still imply  .. eat me .  and in the dark  its all candy.  like politics  remove it and we all have a lot of common interests.   good vid  mm!
nothing more unGodly than wearing steelers colors in church
I think the pastor thing was meant to be a joke hence why he said signed by your brothers not by the pastor. the old joke about family not wanting to see each other half naked but could have missed some context
oh! on the floor at 1 12. a kitty! I knew you were worth a follow.  the temptation to make an  I like to see some  kitty  joke is terrible but I wont to be respectful.
Jesus gave us all the responsibilitie for our selves and to put itsimply the closer you get to the more you ll want to change whether its your dress your walk or talk
you are a gem ma am  -
I do think there is too much of a push for women to show off their bodies. I dont mind on a personal level  but I do think it can encourage insecurity and pressure. at the same time  no-one gets to tell how another person gets to behave. if women want to show themselves off for whatever reason  that is their right. the message shouldn t be that women shouldn t show off their bodies which comes off as sexist  but that they dont have to. personally I think people should be more private and realise that things like onlyfans can stick with you no matter how hard you try to remove it  but people have to live their own lives. some people will be entirely comfortable with being very public about themselves and their bodies and there s nothing inherently wrong with it. why someone is posting themselves is more important as to whether it is healthy.of course there will always be a minority of people who feel like women are too provocative if they re wearing anything other than a nun s outfit.
I agree with some of what you have said here.  we are responsible for ourselves and our sins cannot be blamed on anybody else.  with that being said  the Bible is absolutely clear that we  as Christians  do have a responsibility to not cause other Christians to stumble.  philippians 2 3-4 says  3 do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit  but with humility of mind regard one another as more important than yourselves  4 do not merely look out for your own personal interests  but also for the interests of others.  let s use your example of the gym picture postings.  if you know that there are people  not just men these days  who may have an issue with lust  it behooves you to take them into consideration.  rationalizing in your mind that their sin is their problem flies in the face of this passage.  you are considering yourself as more important than them rather than the other way around.  being a Christian is to be part of Christ s body.  you mentioned the passage matthew 18 9 where Christ says   if your eye causes you to stumble  pluck it out and throw it from you. it is better for you to enter life with one eye  than to have two eyes and be cast into the fiery hell.   this is a good verse!  but dont just read into the surface.  this is also referring to individuals in the church who cause stumbling.  in fact  just two verses prior  matthew 18 7 Christ says   woe to the world because of its stumbling blocks! for it is inevitable thatstumbling blocks come  but woe to that man through whom the stumbling block comes!   then in matthew 18 15-17 Christ discusses how to go about  plucking out the eye    15  if your brother sins  go and show him his fault in private  if he listens to you  you have won your brother. 16 but if he does not listen to you  take one or two more with you  so that by the mouth of two or three witnesses every fact may be confirmed. 17 if he refuses to listen to them  tell it to the church  and if he refuses to listen even to the church  let him be to you as a gentile and a tax collector. two things can be true at once.  no sin can be blamed on anyone but the sinner  however  that does not mean we live in a vacuum.  whether thats fair or not  it is the reality of it.  Im not saying anybody should or should not do something here but I am saying that we need to realize that what we do and how we act reflects Christ to the world and to other believers.  we need to be conscious of that fact and behave accordingly.thanks for the video and have a great day evening week  sister!
decent episode  joke intended
freedom is the answer which ties into accountability  self discipline  and responsibility. the realms of fiction should not be limited. by the same token expressions in the realm of realism hold to the standards of inalienable rights. moral panics have caused society more pain and suffering coming from misplaced puritanical zeal than the alleged affronts of a person s expression of self.
its peanut butter jellie time!
the  covering  for women in the Bible is not a literal veil  but rather the veil of Christ  his protection in other words. also has to do somewhat with end time prophecy  but I wont get into all that. just thought I d share  at least the way I see it.
the thing is  why choose to be part of the problem and not the solution  its not your responsibility yes  but why not help your brothers by not being a door the devil can use to temp them.when you say that its meant for your inner beauty to shine then why allow for a distraction.the choice is yours and while yes  lust is the problem and people should have control of their desires  but as you said people have different strength  this I believe its important for those with a strong will to help our weaker brothers and sisters and not be a way the devil might use to tempt them. that I believe is the duty of the strong to the weak.
you go!
Im not disagreeing.  the mention of the letters of st paul reminded me of an interesting explanation that I heard years ago.  he was the apostle to the gentiles and he was writing to the specific churches about problems they were experiencing   giving advice.  the new Christians were from different areas within the roman empire and likely had some roman citizens  for those who didn t know   not all citizens were romans and most of the inhabitants in the empire were not roman citizens.  for example   st paul was a roman citizen but he was a jewish man from tarsus   which I think is modern day turkey   I dont remember . they tended to have more rights   money   status etc. it was popular for women of this class to copy the styles   behaviors or the romans they saw. the wealthier roman women would wear elaborate hairstyles   jewelry etc and the posers  for lack of a better term   did the same.  while the idea behind what he was saying does apply to us all as believers  he was speaking to a particular place about the issues they were having.  Im sure he said lots of things to all of them in person too. his letters were shared around because he was imprisoned so much   then executed.  I think that was the jist of what I remember   I hope it makes sense
there are extremes on both sides. we cant  deny that fact.
rofl! fair
sadly he was serious and has been defending himself on it
well thats just sad then as a former personal trainer before covid hit there s plenty of physical and mental health reasons to take photos in shorts and a top or bikinImost of which you mentioned.
look up 1st corinthians 10 24 -32 its essentially saying dont do things that will negatively affect your fellow brothers  or sisters  and cause them to stumble or fall. I use the orthodox study Bible  you can look it up to see its foot notes. it doesnt half to be orthodox by the way  I found that Bible to be helpful in understanding things better.
I think the main point of the pastor s tweet is to make sure you do not become a stumbling block  yes men need to have self-control but at the same time the women also need to not create the environment to cause that temptation to lust as well.
I agree with you. no one can make another person sin. I would like to know your thoughts on romans 14 13-18. how does this verse relate to the topic I do believe that Christians  have a responsibility for our brothers and sisters  specifically because of the verses above. while I shouldn t judge others because we each will give an account for our lifestyles before God  I should judge my own habits and remove things that my hinder other Christians. an example. if my spouse has trouble with lust while at the beach  I shouldn t take her there even if it used to be our favorite activity. to take her to the beach would be sin in my opinion.  anyway  I really enjoyed your video. thanks
fax all over this video
I had no idea who you were until the quartering brought your situation up. I ll support anyone who stands against the zombie narrative.
I like that intro.
the original sjws were the religious right sjw classic as one youtuber calls them among others  from the 20s 30s to the 2000salso the newer sjws did join in the 80s 90s but then reappeared in the 2010s mainly  I do not recall the left side sjws being around in the 2000s.
there are plenty of biblical passages that do demand modest and covering clothing though.I know which passage youre talking about  and yes the interpretation is correct.but thats not the only passage. not that I demand for women to cover up personally since Im not Christian  although I have read the Bible several years ago
26 07 potiphar s wife is the original mattressgirl
your main point is right.  lust is the main problem of the luster.when it comes to church itself  paul writes that its disgraceful for woman to be at church with their head uncovered.other revealing unclothing at church would be a lesser included.its a very old Christian tradition  going back to the catholics and orthodox.  has to do with the relation of Jesus as the bridegroom and the church as the bride.  and the relationship between husband and wife represent that.
like that intro!!
I have self-control down for the most part. the only one I have a problem controlling is sexual lust  which is painful to the point where it made me hate myself. it was even one of the main factors making me suicidal in the past. I wish there was a drug that could just kill libido completely. I d pay very good money for it.
sorry for the tldr hard to break writing a 1000-word paper habit. you are correct on a number of things.I dont want a theocracy  but I dont want the woke either.the command to love your neighbor as yourself  aka treat others as you would want to be treated. that is a check on ego and selflessness.as a seminary graduate  mar  mdiv  mth from liberty u   I am firmly against legalism. what Jesus and paul were profoundly against was gatekeeping anything that came between someone and a relationship with Jesus. what annoys many people about paul and Jesus is that they took the law and reinterpreted itso that it robbed certain groups of their power and made everyone equal. paul tells women to cover their heads and be quiet. keep in mind 1. he is a traveling minister  not a lot of time. 2. he needs to quickly get these people back on the mission. 3. his answer is quick  blunt  and pragmatic  he was being dragged into gossip.4. the women  and also men were not reading the room. ie I dont go to a business interview without wearing a suit.  I was aware of a youth pastor that would issue a disclaimer before his sermons  those looking for mates go to the lobby  those looking for anything else stay here.   I was told the kids didn t want to be seen as ass-holes so the kids got with the program if they still wanted to keep their friends. because no one ever wants to go to a john and jane meeting at their Bible study.dm me if you want if you want to q and a and congrats on the new channel.
really enjoyed your comments
Im not a Christian. or religious in any way really and used to be a militant athuest. however Ive come to respect the Bible as part of the canon of western civilisation and I regard it really as millennia old self help book that needs to be read.
had to pause the intro. yes  that is a little blue airplane I saw blowing up the death star ii.
I firmly believe in artistic freedom and will always stand by it. if you dont like something then simply ignore and move on  which cesspool places like twitter and resetera fail to understand. I despise this  correcting art  nonsense thatsome people do  -
the issue with referencing the niv Bible is that many verses have been removed to simplify it for the masses  the niv version only 66 books  with other versions having 73 books and with more traditional Bibles like the orthodox versions having 81 books.  also the fact each Bible is translated different so words and phrases change depending on the era they were made. I like what your doing keep up the good work and hope God blesses you
great f-ing intro!!!
people hold an obligation to self and corporate discipline. its not an either or. as a member of the church  we take on our brother s and sister s well-being. modesty should be practiced  to honor the Lord  not to shield others from sinning. many see modesty as if its a burden instead of a spiritual discipline to be carried out with a joyful heart. perhaps both the pastor s message and yours are both true but simply intended for different audiences. there is no dispute on what you say about cutting out your eye to keep you from sinning and you are correct that it is a heart problem for the individual sinner to address. as a Christian  in knowing that american culture is the world s greatest exporter of sin  if our Lord came back today  Im led to believe that he would chastise first the men for their lust and then the women for not covering themselves in an appropriate manner. what s  an appropriate manner   I dont know where the line is. its probably different for different circumstances...slightly. obscenity is one of those things that you know it when you see it. if you have to ask if something is wrong  you already know the answer.  context is important.  remember  Jesus came first to save us  but his next visit will be as a mighty warrior and ruler. I know its heavy  but it is what it is. judgement is coming for us all. a call for modesty is just as important as a call to not lust...or any other sin for that matter. they are two sides of the same sin drenched coin and both a call to faith in action to Christ s followers. keep at the content. these conversations are healthy and Im truly excited to watch your channel grow.
preach!
please share them that I didn t address  I d love to look into it further. because nothing I have seen through all my research has imposed any sort of dress code on women in the name of stopping men from lusting.
@melonie mac go boom  sure thing. now bear with me because it was a long time ago since I read scripture  so memory might be a bit jostled. but one or two from exodus and corinthians came to mind.exodus 28 42 esv you shall make for them linen undergarments to cover their naked flesh. they shall reach from the hips to the thighs
@melonie mac go boom  1 corinthians 12 23 and on those parts of the body that we think less honorable we bestow the greater honor  and our unpresentable parts are treated with greater modesty
@melonie mac go boom  now  I dont know how you personally interpret Christian faith  so there might be a chance that you dismiss these in particular for being quoted from the old testament.which is fine  I suppose. but at the same time  pastors and Christians will frequently quote old testament scripture in order to reinforce arguments they make. Im not saying that you do  I just think it comes across as cherry picking when I see it happen  they extol the virtues of the old testament when itsuits them  but deny the validity of the old testament whenever a passage might sound bad to a modern audience
rofl yes
to my knowledge  at that time it was so not to confuse them with prostitutes. not an actual imposed dress code on women in general.
@melonie mac go boom  that could be one reason!  its certainly too deep of a theological discussion to have on youtube comments lol.but hey even on youtube there s plenty of catholic orthodox commentators that can explain the totality of the theology behind it and why its important.in coptic Christian churches in the middle east its actually Christian tradition for men to sit on one side of the church and women the other!
dont hate yourself over this. we all have struggles in our own areas and part of being human means we aren t perfect. the fact that you try is important. Jesus died for our sins  we always need that grace because we will never be perfect. but thats ok. I cantell you have a good heart - God bless you
epic
clearly the onus to war against sin is on the individual. we are not tempted beyond what we are able to to overcome. however we are instructed to not cause another to falter in his or her journey.  romans 14 13  let us not therefore judge one another any more  but judge this rather  that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his brother s way. 1 corinthians 8 9  but take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to them that are weak. now the romans verse is  I think  referring to a direct invitation to sin. the corinthians verse though seems to suggest we shpuld be more mindful of the ability of our actions to unsettle another s footing on the straight and narrow. I also do think youre not correct when you say there is no biblical basis for clothing being modest  and modest in the new colloquial meaning as in covering enough. 1 timothy 2  9 in like manner also  that women adorn themselves in modest apparel  with shamefacedness and sobriety  not with broided hair  or gold  or pearls  or costly array 10 but  which becometh women professing Godliness  with good works. now what all this means for clothing options Im not totally sure. it would be a very boring life if all women were put into niqaabs  at least from a man s standpoint haha. its also clearly not wrong to dress to be attractive to the opposite sex. but we all understand there is a line on what is appropriate  surely there is a possibility for too much skin in certain scenarios. I suppose the line changes radically depending on the setting eh  bikinis in church probs not great  but at the beach I think the pastor is a bitstingy about it. take this as a comment from a sinful fallen man who likes pretty women in reality  games  and shows.
true. I dont agree with the second part of the pastor s reasoning. women and men both have their own challenges to contend with. vanity and lust. neither of which you fall under mel.
green m m was drawn sexy as a play on the green m m urban legend. oh no!
melonie- a pastor or church or any group does not define your faith- follow your faith not other people who claim to be  authorities   of your faith- God bless
nice new intro!
I hate how both camps imply  if not outright state  that men are just helpless beasts that cant help themselves.why cant we have the opposite idea  the one that normal people are fully capable of reason and self-control  and that the ones who cannot are the exception.
I think that there is responsibility on both sides. yes absolutely men should be  taking every though captive  when it comes to lust  at the same time  women should not go around flaunting their bodies constantly. many many women dont understand what it is like being a man and having a constant barrage of sexual thoughts. itsucks trying to remain pure in today s society. Im not saying everyone should be wearing a burka  just that fellow sisters could have a bit more respect for their fellow brothers and maybe be a bit more modest in their dress. tankinI instead of a bikinI  thigh shorts instead of booty shorts  thatsort of thing. to say its entirely on men in this issue I think is a bit inconsiderate. if you ever want some more insight into this I d recommend reading  every man s battle .
very cute and funny intro
this is something big I harp on and get in trouble with as a catholic xd even in genisis  God said his creation of humans was good. this means he didn t think we were incomplete or in need of clothing or censor bars  but that every inch of us was perfect in his sight. its our own perversion of his creation that defines good and bad. Im no saint  but I hardly believe that acknowledging and appreciating attractiveness is wrong. neither is sex itself wrong. its misusing the creation for abusive means that makes things sinful.
that cat is one big ol  chonkster.
to be fair  that post talking about women posting pictures of themselves in bikinis  etc. wasn t saying that if some man has a problem with lust it can be blamed on the women. two things could be true at the same time  women shouldn t dress too scantily  which  I agree with you that the examples given are not all crossing that line  and men should control their own thoughts and deal with lust if they have an issue with that.
enjoyed hearing a Christians perspective on the wanton puritanical behaviour we keep hearing. the puritans got pushed to leave england and go to the colonies for a reason. itseems they re making a grand  unwanted return. keep the boom going mm!
three words  alternative media account.
youre missing the part where modesty is a virtue.that is in the Bible.
the left is team red m m   and   the rite is team green m m  its crazy how they re going at it.   ha - ha.
I dont think it is about puritanism   it is corporatism - it makes everything   everybody disposable.  in the secular
I believe its both. modesty is something that is being said over and over but you kind of glossed over it. its the middle that the emphasis is on.  ephesians 6  1-2 is a great example. so  I say  men  keep it in your pants and encourage women to be modest and beautiful  women  be modest and encourage men to value your inner beauty first and you can still be sexy and beautiful.
just me being a goof. beauty does not come from outer adornment  but from within ......so....what he s saying is.......no clothing I jest
my views are  do no harm  respect others choices  take responsibility for your own actions  help those in need and live a life you can be proud of. Im an agnostic  that being said I dont discount the principles extolled in the Bible. much of what is written in the Bible is teaching us how to relate to each other in a respectful and peaceful manner. if more people understood and practiced this kind of tolerance towards others there wouldn t be the kind of violence and hatred that have become so prevalent in the recent years. live your best life and let others do the same.
awesome intro
modesty isn t a dress code. modesty applies to so many things  not flaunting wealth  being humble  etc
@melonie mac go boom  it applies to many things  including dress code
@melonie mac go boom  sure...it also applies to flaunting your body.  at least by every definition mankind has used up until this point.Im not a prude and you make some good points...but dressing to elicit lust  sorry...thats the reason people do it  really is tacky.a person can dress in an attractive way without letting it all hang out.
this was awesome. im sick of literally in all media and entertainment people that believe in God are all equated to the westborough baptist church.
I find it amusing that just because Ive been much more irritated of the woke left and been openly disliking them more and trashing on them a lot lately  the tradkuk right and gop supporters automatically assume Im all of the sudden on  their side   lol.just because the left has become more blatantly bad and tyrannical for the past several decades doesnt change the fact that the right still has their own agenda which also involves massive puritanism  and has a lot of views thatstrongly conflict with my pro-decentralization and anti-censorship stance.
wus up chicky!!!!!! the opening was awesome!
Im fringe Christian but pastors   preachers like him put me off I like listening to people like you jay and  kerry smith that has faith but its a part of them but not all of them
I can understand the first part of the message the second half doesnt makes no sense to me. good content btw.
1 timothy 2 9-15. 9 is where focus will be  but recommend to read the other verses as well. I use the king james version  love the old english and for me it allows for greater clarity than the modern texts. 9 reads   in like manner also  women adorn themselves in modest apparel  with shamefacedness and sobriety  not with broided hair  or gold  or pearl  or costly array. what s modest apparel  its the covering of one s body  not simply the chest and waist. so women who wear apparel that allows the showing of their body is committing sin. this would also apply to wearing tight apparel in allowing the showing of the body.a reason why a women would wear such skimpy clothing is to attract. so it can lead to lustful thoughts. can a man reject lustful thoughts  yes he can  but doesnt mean the woman is innocent of attempting a lustful response.all of this obviously applies both ways.
Ive had quite an evolving viewpoint of religion. when I was young  teenager to around 24  I was a bit of a hateful prick towards religion. I was also a coward and wouldn t voice my opinion so I didn t cause problems. I considered myself an atheist as a teenager and an  agnostic  in my early twenties. I still consider myself agnostic  but not the parody version that goes no further than  I dont know . I believe in a God  but not the common religion version of God. to me  God is the immutable rules of the universe. kill someone and they die  dont eat and you die  live an unclean life and die early  the goldilocks zone is required for life  so on and so forth. I also dont believe in an afterlife. I think what we do in life is all we get. no eternal salvation for the faithful nor eternal torment for the sinners. the closest to an afterlife I believe in is a sorta reincarnation  but not really. everything is made of matter that cant be destroyed. when we die we decay  or at least we re supposed to . the carrion bugs and scavenging predators eat the flesh of the dead  the matter they re made from . then the flesh eaters use that matter taken from the dead to make babies. sometimes the flesh eaters dont find the dead and the body is eventually food for plants which are food for herbivores which are food for carnivores... and omnivores fit in somewhere too. our matter is constantly recycling and being used to make future life. I think its the closest thing to an afterlife that exists. I also dont view sins as a strictly evil thing. each sin has its place in humanity and  sometimes  life as a whole. for instance envy. its not a wholly bad thing. its important to be a little envious  that way you may strive for more than simply surviving. but envy does become a problem when itstarts to define you  because unchecked envy leads to thievery which makes things worse for everybody. sometimes things deserve your wrath and anger  but it must be kept in check lest the innocent get caught in your wake  which again  makes things worse for everybody. without some amount of gluttony we dont eat and die  and without some amount of lust we dont reproduce  both leading to extinction in the very unlikely situation where every single person gave it up completely  or in other words  worse for everybody. all the sins are more about moderation than total suppression and the moderating it is more about what s better for humanity rather than what s better for the self. after all  what s better for humanity is better for the self in the long run.there s something that makes me wonder if the religion version of God actually does exist though. and thats that everyone  whether religious or not  will pray to God to make their pain end when undergoing extreme trauma. anyone who has experienced multi-day pain thats so bad you cant even think ends up praying to God to make itstop. I know because Ive been there. its one of those things Ive revisited a bit. am I just taking anecdotal evidence at face value  or is it a the universe s  coding  showing through  its something I go back and forth on.
I agree with you  this puritanical behavior is why we  Christians  lost the first culture war.
Imostly agree  but I believe there is responsibility if you sexualize yourself  especially if you know someone struggles with lust. there s a difference between just being attractive or scantily clad  and trying to arouse. consider romans 14 21 and basically all of 14  its about not tempting others with things that dont tempt you or that you believe are not sinful. if you are extremely attractive and wearing normal attire it is 100  on those who see you  but if you wear impractically designed lingerie to the grocery store or pose move in a sexual way disiring to be lusted after  you share the responsibility.
intro is lit
its nothing to do with the word. its to do with making real world relationships work. women want to keep advertising for a richer  stronger  more famous male while they re still in relationships. its hypergamy  and its extremely disrespectful to the male they chose to be with. even worse if they re married b c she can  and 80  of the time is the one to initiate  divorce for no reason at any time and financially wreck their husband.bottom line   women showing off their body is for their hoe phase. if she s chosen a male to be with  dont continue to advertise herself as being single. no more social media. no more girls nights out. no more hot girl summers. too much temptation to stray from her male. yes  even body progress pics  b c guys be sliding into those dms  and what women doesnt like male affirmation  thats temptation right there
do you not think that you or any women in general  should leave something for their future husband  a line of some sort certainly there is a duty on the man to not be lustful  but is there not a duty on women a certain amount of chastity
its about the belief in individual autonomy. no one should try to control another
I think there should be a balance.men shouldn t lust  no  and need to learn to look away.however  if a woman  who claims to be a Christian  is flaunting and showing a lot of skin  she becomes a stumbling block. in galatians 6  2 Christians are called to bear each other s burdens. that would include empathy for other s weaknesses  not  their lust isn t my problem im ma wear whatever.  they can deal with it.  it isn t the deep love we re called to have.  therefore let us not judge one another anymore  but rather determine this not to put an obstacle or a stumbling block in a brother s way. -romans 14  13 but take care that this liberty of yours does not somehow become a stumbling block to the weak. -1 corinthians 8  9paul even said in 1 corinthians that if it meant that it would make his brother to stumble  he would not eat meat again.same could be said about a woman in a bikini.  not saying a two piece  but an 85  nude bikinI .usually when Imention balance and women showing modesty and caring about men  people go to the other extreme. no  I dont think women should go around in burkas  turtle necks  and ankle skirts. thigh high shorts   booty shorts... that kind of ballance.same thing if a guy is around a girl who he knows has a lust problem and they re going to the beach with a bunch of friends  he should wear a shirt because he doesnt want her to stumble. because he cares about her.
when I first went  to a german swimming pool I saw couple of german women topless and as a 13 years old I was like hole crap look at that. but more times I seen it I was like yeah its how they do it here and they dont go crazy over women being topless or no bottomless  ether. the one thing as I  met my  german friends for the first time they said you are a american right   I haven t spoken a word yet I said yes how did you know they  said youre swimming trunks cuz they wear speedos well at least at that time and I said well I ll stick out like an american cuz Im not wearing them speedos. I had a blast over there its my  second home Imiss you guys.
self control is a virtue but paul even told people so much as to not eat food dedicated to idols  pagan Gods  so as not to cause others to stumble in their faith. being a stumbling block is the context. we aren t suppose to encourage sin by our grace and cause others to stumble but disencourage it when it comes down to the gospel of Jesus Christ. james 5 4 says to him that knows to do good  and does it not  it is sin. lust is thatstumbling block and encouraging that is a personal decision people make
Im not gonna write an essay on this. no one has time to read it. so I ll just say yes. yes people take scripture waaayyyyy out of context. from the front of the book to the back of the book
horseshoe theory at its finest
modesty is talk about in the scription s it was more geared to the wealthy women and men that was showing off their wealth it referred to simple dress and being humble but we still have a modesty problem today it has changed overtime you wont go to church half not covered up  extremely sexy clothing for men and women just showing off too much of them self do you see it in the women s march that is in modest dress you also see it in the lgbtq parades that is what they mean by being in modestdressing modestly for who you are as an individual it was important and living by the teachings of Jesus Christ and staying away from sin we all can be sons and daughters of God you are a daughter of God as long as you live in obedience to God s laws
im just here for mac go boom asmr
this!
Imade it clear that I dont post provocative pics. imo gym progress pics are not provocative.
yeah...we should stay humble even in our style and yes I agree  we should all not lust after each other. its a human problem not a gender problem imo
22 03 this is the kind of thing where it depends like when someone grew up and obviously this pastor is influenced by feminism. to say thatsomeone who says that a woman shouldn t dress a certain way because she will have a higher chance to get attacked is   blaming the victim  is one of those feminist nonsensical things thatsome people have come to adopt as something that makes sense because of a lack of perspective given  because back when people were indoctrinated with this more subtle form of feminism the internet didn t exist for alternative viewpoints to be expressed on a massive scale.a guy saying a woman shouldn t dress a certain way coz she might get raped walking home is no more blaming the victim than someone telling someone you shouldn t walk through dark alleys wearing a rolex and diamonds or someone saying that you should have situational awareness and avoid situations where you see people who might be causing trouble or something like that.. again you cant control human nature but you can only control yourself. the argument  you have to take responsibility for yourself  is being used here but it is being used here in a way that is completely ignorant of human nature and is actually doing the opposite. what s  being done here is absolving women of all responsibility whatsoever for how they appear to men  and telling all men that they need to change their behavior  which is the complete opposite of  taking responsibility  and is exactly  telling the whole world to change for you. but the phrase  come on  shows that he really thinks thats what s being said but thats not the case. the vast majority of people who would tell women they shouldn t walk home dressed in minimal clothing are not blaming any victims. that is the same kind of nonsense that feminists say today to attack men who they dont agree with. its a generalization  its an assumption and its simply not true.but its interesting because the further you go back the more subtle it is  but this is a beautiful example of like a more subtle reply  to what male feminists do today.like if you listen to what opponents of feminism said in the 90s  you would hear  if we dont stop this now then in twenty years....  and they literally go on to verbatim describe what s happening right now.  and every time they re treated as extremist lunatics but what they say seems to have come to pass.I think the whole way women dress nowadays is a non-issue. I think most men dont have a hard time with it  no pun intended  because they re used to it and at this point there s not much more women cantake off without being naked so its not a big deal.  but these same ideas are being applied across the board in the liberal space.
what about wanting to love monster girls demI human woman
I fully agree with this video that lust is not the fault of the person s dressing but I do have to disagree that dressing modestly is something that can be woven aroundyes Jesus came to hang around and save sinners of all kind which is why he was with them he came to guide them from their sins I believe everyone should dress moderately as the occasion should demand although I dont think that telling every woman in the world to cover up will yield actual resultsbut dressing indecently imo is like going out to a lion s animals habitat wearing meat or food that will attract them of course its not your fault these people think the way they do and anything they do is completely their fault and responsibility but just dressing decently would very well be better than not  of course the thing about sin is that even a reformed rapist could still relapse if enough temptation is provided again still their fault but dressing decently would be better than not imo
subscribed after quartering vid.
stop looking men.  even on tv.  after months of trying  self control  even women in tv can...spring up a reaction.  it takes just looking away or looking them in the eye.  stop looking.  look away.  women...this is why I dont look at most people.  so on the flip side...you would make the men more comfortable and natural around you if you weren t showing so much skin...and thats just a natural thing.  even  good boys  will be uncomfortable.  so...meh...practice good judgement and be loving of others. men if the women and women of the men as brothers and sisters.and fyi...a big brother or even  type  can not want you walking around exposed.  many things kinda surround this topic.
13 therefore let us not pass judgment on one another any longer  but rather decide never to put a stumbling block or hindrance in the way of a brother. 14 I know and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus that nothing is unclean in itself  but it is unclean for anyone who thinks it unclean. 15 for if your brother is grieved by what you eat  you are no longer walking in love. by what you eat  do not destroy the one for whom Christ died. 16 so do not let what youregard as good be spoken of as evil. 17 for the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking but of righteousness and peace and joy in the holy spirit.  rom 14.13-17 seems to be omitted from this discussion.
isn t our fear and shame of our bodies itself a part of our sinful nature  we aren t perfect and that is ok
how do you move past the dress modestly part of the passage you cite to support your argument     its a non starter  its one thing for women to dress in more colorful clothing but in an age of of  seeking arrangements  and other monetization of female sexuality  its pretty absurd that these same women claim to be Christians. no self respecting Christian should have a thirst trap ig profile or walk around in a streetwalker s uniform
j. scott campbell  thats me... almost. my middle initial is j.
mel  I dont think youre way off base here. but  I think youre missing some important details. at the end of the day  we re all responsible for our own sins. of course thats true. but to say that you should be able to act however you want  no matter how likely it is to encourage others to sin  and they should just suck it up and stop sinning  well  thats an overly simplistic  and frankly  not a very Christian attitude to have. as Christian brothers and sisters  part of our responsibility is towards each other. we are called to bring other people with us closer to God  not just to worry about ourselves. we are our brothers  keepers.would you say its totally fine that every time you hang out with your recovering alcoholic friend  you drink heavily in front of them  would you say that its appropriate to walk naked around the house in front of your stepfather  probably not. and therefore  that means you admit that there is a line that you can cross  and that it is important to consider how your actions will affect others  at least in certain situations. so then its just a matter of figuring out where that line is. but to say theres no line at all is a little bit crazy.take your example of wearing a crop top to church. you say you think Jesus would have no issue with that. well  I disagree. in doing so  you are taking something thats meant to be about giving your attention to God  and drawing that attention onto yourself. anything that could distract anyone else and ruin their time with God is inconsiderate at best. the thing I think you dont understand  is that all men with normal levels of testosterone are basically sex addicts. canthey control themselves  sure. but it would be like putting a heroin addict in a room with a bag of heroin and telling them not to do it. whoever is sitting behind you at church is gonna have an awful hard time not looking. its like putting someone in a room with an elephant and telling them not to think about elephants. they might be able to do it  maybe  but theyre still going to be thinking about how they cant think about elephants  instead of being able to get closer to God. I dont think you understand how powerful visual stimulI can be for a man. and thats fine  I wouldn t expect you to. is it your fault directly if someone lusts after you in church  no  but a little bit of consideration towards other people s propensity to sin certainly wouldn t be a bad thing.anyway  I dont know where the line is  and I dont claim to know. Im just playing devils advocate. different cultures have different standards of modesty. and someone who is determined to lust will do so no matter what. but there are people in between  who dont want to sin  but can be tempted in the right situation  and you shouldnt want that for them.
1 timothy 2 9  likewise also that women should adorn themselves in respectable apparel  with modesty and self-control  not with braided hair and gold or pearls or costly attire. ----  believers in Christ are held to a certain standard. not by man  but by our creator. he wants us to separate ourselves from pagan culture. that includes customs  traditions  behavior and how we dress.

I have to admit I was expecting a much worse take when I hear someone start using the  both sides  language than a debate over what the Bible means regarding a certain issue.  I dont feel ready to comment on this issue yet.  I was just expecting the video to go full cringe horseshoe theory.  I have my fears regarding anyone that comes to a libertarian   classical liberal type philosophy without a strong grounding in economics  mainly austrian school .  thankfully religious values can also help ground someone and keep them from attempting to extend libertarian thinking into their complete moral views and may help guard from the infection that is leftism.
I bet if you told a wokester the m m on the left was a gay man  they d have no problem with the picture whatsoever.
the sin of scandal is a real thing. preventing the public display of evil  the incentivization of immorality is a good thing.thats the reason gore is not allowed and baphomet statutes should be destroyed.
I want to show a lot of skin. so its wrong if someone thinks women should be more modest. do you honestly think God wants women posting provocative photos  its not about blaming women for men s lack of self control. its about a lack of self-respect in flaunting your body.
uh  I have never found anthropomorphic candy the least bitsexually attractive.
I have to disagree with the arguments to cover up. just because Jesus didn t specifically speak on something doesnt mean that it wasn t relevant. he had a 3 year ministry that was pretty focused at the jewish people who already had the  the law . both men and women has expectations regarding dress within  the law . that being said do I agree that there is context to show weight loss pics  etc.. but it would depend on the context and how its done.  modesty is a principal in the church. modesty also has cultural relevance. north american ideas of dress may considered explicit in other cultures.
a reason why many believers dis agree on things even when they all study their Bible is that there are so many different versions of Bibles out there. example king james version   niv   etc. me personally I trust mainly the kjv but I also use e-sword  to translate certain words in context since many words meant different things back then. a Bible version I dont trust is the niv. I heard so many things that are very sus about that version such as how there are verses missing important facts etc. a reason there are many versions of the Bible because people wanna make money off of the Bible but they can only sell their versions if it is at least 10  different than the others.
modesty is a giant umbrella term  usually to mean being humble. in this case not drawing too much attention to yourself or your riches  etc. and like I said in this video  culture is important and I dress more modest for church than my normal day to day gym clothes  for example.
I read this verse in the video
Imean no disrespect to you. just remember we re supposed to be modest. obviously  we all fall short from the glory of God. we all do things that we shouldn t. we just need to recognize those things and try to correct them. we need to pray and ask for guidance. we should never resort to our own understanding of God s law. on a side note  Im happy to see that your new channel is growing.
showing skin and being provocative dont inherently go hand in hand. you can be provocative in a snow suit.
28 29 I really truly mean no offense here   but sometimes you need look no further than the world around you to see why some things were better off in different ways. when you can see something in front of your face  you dont need a verse to confirm it. we are living the consequence of throwing tradition away. and Im sorry but I dont want to just set the world on fire and say  well the Bible says the world is bad and temporary etc. and Jesus is coming so screw it.  I would rather the world be the best it can be  and the more you go back in time the better it was.if there was a time machine I would literally leave this world and go live the rest of my life out in the past.29 13 also... hugs
24 36 -  ...you cannot serve two masters.  this is just taking a verse out of context. the full reading of the verse says   no one can serve two masters. either you will hate the one and love the other  or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other.  you cannot serve both God and money .  this verse is talking about money  not lust. its about who you are making the master over your life. the rest of that chapter Jesus speaks about how the father provides food for the birds and how he clothes the fields of grass with beautiful flowers  and that if the father can do that  how much more will he provide food and clothing for his children. it is the gentiles that toil in labor worrying about where they are going to get their food and clothing because they dont know where their next meal is coming from or their next article of clothing because they dont have a promise from their Gods that they will provide these things for them.  but seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness  and all these things will be added unto you.   and by  all these things  Jesus means things to drink  food to eat  and clothes to wear. seek after God first  and he will provide all the things you need to survive by providing the money and supplies you need. its very fitting that Jesus says this because he was homeless for his 3 year ministry  not working a job  and still his father provided for him.the western church needs to stop using the Bible as a theology grab book and start reading things in their full context  which means understanding the ot culture and ideas referenced in the nt. where do you think Jesus got his ideas from  also  why did Jesus hang out with prostitutes  it was because they were sick and needed healing. Jesus didn t approve of what they did  but he wasn t going to let them suffer in anguish from their sin if he could heal them of it. and Im also positive that prostitutes back then weren t wearing bikinis or overly revealing clothing.as far as modesty  how far are women willing to push the boundaries until they finally put their foot down and say   we have reached the point of where it is not acceptable anymore to show any more skin.  how do women choose that line compared to men  I wonder what the scriptural defense of wearing a bikinI would be  didn t yhwh make a fur covering for adam and eve when they discovered that they were naked  I say this because bikinis have only been around for less than 100 years and hardly cover any skin. the entire point of a bikinI is to be eye candy to men. women somehow survived not wearing them for at least the last 3 000 years. are one piece swimsuits that much worse   and dont get me started on booty shorts. those things cover less skin than lingerie does.women like the attention they get  and they find that they get more attention the less clothing they wear. women s choice in clothing is also to impress their lady friends. their image of themselves can change on a day-to-day basis usually based on if they think they look cute today or not. as you pointed out about the woman referenced by paul were trying to flaunt their wealth. women nowadays are trying to flaunt their style and body shape.
go boom!
brian s comment sounds like he spends a bit too much time on instagram  specifically looking for women who show too much skin  then post it on instagram to virtue signal by saying its wrong for women to choose what they wish to wear and show off. for me personally  it is a choice as it is a form of expression and Im all for the freedom of expression. no one is holding a figurative gun to a man s head to lustfully look for women who show off their assets. likewise  men can show off what they wish or dress how they wish but no one is holding a figurative gun to a woman s head and make them look at that. self-discipline and self-control are keys to being a mature adult.
its not even puritanical its something a lot worse!
I feel like there is a lot of projection happening when you are talking about the green m m stuff melonie. itsays a lot more about and how you perceive  femininity  than anything. just everything about this seems like a self report...
Im sorry  but in this youre incorrect. both paul and peter weren t speaking for themselves they were speaking from the Lord. not only that but every law in the old testament was from the mouth of our Lord. he is the lawgiver. he is also the way by which grace came.when Jesus said not a single jot or tittle of the law will by any means disappear  he wasn t joking. the laws of the old testament are the laws today. we wont gain salvation through obedience to the laws  but through obedience to the spirit that he gives to dwell within us. but willingly breaking the law  and teaching others to  will not go unpunished. I suppose  if your view of being  least  in heaven is that of still being there  pray to God for clarification.that being said  dont be the cause of your brother s sin. wear what you like  within reason. unreasonable is anything designed and intended to cause a sexual reaction in another.  well  they should control themselves!  granted. and so should you. your interpretation of peter and paul s commands was due to your own preference  but they were clear. there wasn t a  in a building inhabited by believers  preface. the church is world wide. indoors  or out. in a gathering  or alone. all who belong to Christ are the church.
maybe there is no dress code for women  but the fact that youre wearing pants every day feels weird.
oh God  that pastor guy- he was just being sexist  thinking he can control how we display ourselves. he could have promoted modesty  but instead he stuck his foot in his mouth and insulted women  and spoke for men who never asked for him to represent them.
marmots are illegal. I love those old calendar girl calendars. hotties!!!  by the way  non-binaries are boring.
during peter s era there was barely any churches as we know it today. they even used to exclude women from entering the synagogues until Jesus supposedly came. so I doubt that he was commenting on women going to churches wearing expensive clothes.
ok  so if men find you attractive  its their fault  many women derive their self esteem from their sexual attractiveness  and thats fine  but taking credit for being attractive and then blaming men for actually finding you attractive sounds a bit hypocritical to me.
freedom from the tyranny of other people s beliefs.
12 20 with all due respect   you are reading what you want into scripture so that you can justify your position.  youre doing exactly what you claim others are doing.
that pastor wasn t wrong tho. and I say that as a fan of your channel.

well said
I think she s missing that  the church  was how they referred to the members of the faith as a whole rather than a building for mass.
@zebra pleco  nah  Imean thatsaint peter was probably referring to just general behavior. back in the days  Christians were persecuted  it was also the religion of the poor and commoners. made everyone able to practice the religion and a big portion of the jew community rejected that notion  even saint paul hunted them down and they had to hide to  celebrate  mass in secret. so its not probable that people were dressing up nicely with their sunday attire as people did in the past centuries to show up at a mass. Imight be wrong though...I stopped being a religious person about 20 years ago so I haven t read scripture in a long long time...f...Im old...
finding someone attractive and actively lusting  telling them they have to cover up to keep them from sinning are two different things
their was a time she rebel from God   she talked about it a little. so how can say when she had them tattoos  maybe she ll make a video on that
Ive heard itsaid thatscarification for shame purposes was common at that time and that is what it was referencing  but Im not 100  sure on it. also the old law had a lot of things that were abolished after Jesus  sacrifice. I admittedly need to research further though.

then again without lust and a healthy sex drive. the human race wouldn t be where it is now. as much as I respect people s beliefs. there are occasions where its kinda counter productuctive.
as far as nudity  the only issue is  if youre a kid  underaged  no dont show your body like that. remember the pedos are alive and well. parents  take responsibility. but as far as for myself  being a Christian woman  I dont want to be half naked because thats for my future husband  my opinion . women can do as they please within Gods standards. each side needs self control. women lust after dudes just as much as men do women. however  hyper Christian s   the super self righteous  say tattoos will damn you  having a piercing will damn you blah blah blah. there s a balance.

8 13 says there is no reason  makes no statement on the interest of the individual  yeah the typical one side of the coin scenario.  unfortunately people will criticize you because themselves  so if you do have your reasons for putting your business on a medium used by a large number of people no that the public will use what they see in their own interest.
every time I watch your videos I get tempted  until I saw that disgusting steelers jacket lol.
that pastor can speak for himself and leave me out of his grouping. if a woman want so show off her curves because she proud of them. no one alive dead  has any right tell her she cant.  the wokies dont get to pick and choose theses things nor should they have any power over anyone.  ifything the wokies should be pittied as their life is most certainly empty of anything meaningful and they have a empty void they are trying to fill by bad mouthing them and trying to bring them down  to their low level.
the art has been ruined!
8 16  you sure that guy is a pastor and not an imam I suppose he d like all women to dress in burkhas   veils.  probably wants to forbid women to drive or leave the house by themselves  too.
I stop listening to pastors along time ago

I dont belong to any faith but my older brother is. my understanding is we are all sinners and there is nothing in the Bible thatsays one thing is more of a sin the others unless its a deadly sin. again this is just my understanding of what I have been told so wondering if you agree with that
your argument misses the obvious. your whole reason for posting your pics and looking good is to inspire lust. why is itso important to have your body looking so sexy  are you not trying to make on lookers crave the opportunity to be with you  Imean why even be sexy if you dont want people to think your sexy  do you think when a peacock shows its feathers its not to get attention from the opposite sex
you dont question God. the church is not God. question the church  if something doesnt seem right.
what about this verse below in the Bible  as a woman you cannot answer me without disagreeing with the Bible I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man  rather  she is to remain quiet.1 timothy 2 11-15
Im not a Christian so please ignore my ignorance here. I have read the Bible and even own my own copy  as well as many times spoken to those with strong faith whom I class as friends and almost family.  but what Im struggling here with is how is lust truly a sin and surely its only the over reaching actions subsequent of lust that create the sin   if its mere lust and no ill will or harm is caused then how is that a manifestation of evil   maybe I just repeated myself there . furthermore isn t lust simply one of the many steps towards people of either sex finding compatable life partners  I totally agree lust is on the the part of those whom take actions based on thier fealings or desires rather than the recipient. but again if its just controlled expressions and its towards another whom is potentially  avalable  then surely the Bible encourages coupling
in my opiniononly God is pure perfectionthe book is the guide to this divine standardwe are humans  not Godswe are flawed by the original sinthe standard will therefor not entirely be achievable  hence  standard  it is meant to strive towards ithowever you have the free will to do this to any degreeand have the direct and in-direct consequencesnobody can impose it upon youyou interpret the book live your lifeand face the final and only judgementits your sole burden for the free will that was granted upon you by the sacrificeso that you are not enslaved  and so have self determinationas there is no good unless the person choose itwithout free will it would be null and voidand there would be no reason to exist  creation of humansto become closer to the standard  and therefor closer to Godas close towards God to be redeemed

brian sauve sounds a bit too similar to the left or al-qaeda. maybe mr. sauve is in the wrong religion. everything is within context. as a Christian I think you want to treat clothing in the same way you would at your professional day job. I try my best to remove my piercings and hide my tattoos when going to work church. its the same as samuraI in the old days removing their swords before performing tea ceremony. what you choose to wear outside of that context and in your personal life is between you and God.on lust  Im familiar with those verses  but I think the main thing I take away from this as a young man is to have self control. personally I think the word lust needs to be broken down since I think the idea of lust helps me to be a better lover in monogamous relationship. this also relates to pre-marital sex of which I am guilty of and repenting for  but this is one of the issues with being lustful. acknowledge your sin personal problem and fix it  some people eat junk-food and wonder why they re unfit . I think if you lack self control when it comes to sex  that is problematic in the same way itsays somewhere in the Bible that drunkeness is a bad thing  but drinking without getting drunk isn t . another example is that eatting isn t a sin  but gluttony is  similar to lust  . do not practice lust or have lustful desires constantly. lust can also be used in literary terms that is non-sexual as in  lust for blood   and I guess you can also have lust for money . the point is to practice self control and try your best to say centered. I think people who work out  do keto and intermittent fasting probably have a better idea how to understand this since it takes a good amount of effort and self control to accomplish  do not pursue worldly pleasures  etc  etc.
blaming women for lust is a muslim thing  not Christian.
Bible channel  you are losing me here melanie....
ppl misinterperet holy scripture lust and all that is natural not a sin God means that we just should be animals and take ppl with force and prioriticize sex  rest is bs  rest related to the topic is not sinso I disagree with some of what Bible says its just misinterptation of Gods wordsand second  also I believe that God has never spoken to humans and all the holy scripture and stories are man made up to make ppl fear something cause law of men was not enough in old times so they came up with thatfollowing the Bible leads to self hatread its like vurbuly abusive spouse who always yells saying how usless u are cause incuding awry thing normal and part of being human like lusting for some1 and watching porn and pleasuring urself as a sin is same as vurbuly abusive spouse its unhealthy psyhically and mentally u half to be human meaning allowing urself this things
why are you afraid to go against a pastor  do you believe pastors can never be wrong or should never be wrong
a woman explaining Christian theology and failing to understand the cardinal virtue of prudence.not even surprising.
is this channel about gaming culture or about citing Bible  dont get me wrong I dont have problem with religious people  but if I wanted to see or hear Bible I would go to church or some Christianity chanel  you see  when you are saying this video is about gaming culture then sneak in and preach Bible  I feel kind of fooled and betrayed by you.
there are some sins that the Bible calls abominations and I think those are perceived as worse  but ultimately there is nothing we can do that God cant forgive except one  blasphemy of the holy spirit  and to my knowledge the context of that is to attribute the holy spirit to satan.
@melonie mac go boom  interesting.
a lot of Christians do it unfortunately
bye
@melonie mac go boom  buh bye!
I never once said this was a gaming channel. this is a social commentary channel. I talk about whatever I want and will continue to do so. Bible verse of the day in every video  and I will not apologize for it.
