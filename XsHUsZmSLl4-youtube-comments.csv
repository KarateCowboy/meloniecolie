nikolaj coster-waldau  jaime lannister  should have played joel. with short hair and a beard he looks a lot like him. plus he s a great actor  and he also learns his characters and understands them.
I remember the interviews with angelina jolie where she talked about playing through tomb raider in preparation for the movie.  she specifically mentioned thatshe enjoyed the grunts and sounds lara made as she was running and climbing.  that always stood out to me that different people could latch on to different aspects of the same media.  now apparently we re in a world where that level  or any level  of preparation for a role is bad.  and hollywood wonders why they are losing money.  wonder what they ll blame when they cant blame the  vid anymore.
just realize when they make these shows its not for the fans its for them lol
the reachers will be reachers.  ironically  reacher was a very well done book adaptation and the actor was very concerned about being true to the character.
while I am also of the  live and let live  mentality  I also believe that that time period is over and we need to seriously start standing up against all of our institutions that have been rotted out from within for decades from these lunatics. I will not  live and let live  myself into oppression anymore. it has been a slowly losing battle that is picking up pace. woke politics have always been trash and people are finally starting to put their foot down but the people in charge are still going to push this down our throats and make it unbearable for those of us that dont follow suit. I dont want this. but I feel like the time of peace is coming to an end. being a Christian yourself  Im sure you can see the signs. dont ignore them. the signs are there for a reason.
just look at heath ledger. dude immersed himself in the background and psychology of the joker  then put his own spin on the character with the tongue flick  face paint  costume  other physical mannerisms  and so on. other characters like henry cavill with geralt  daniel day lewis one of the most successful actors of all time is well known to have immersed himself into characters and roles  and ryan reynolds in his portrayal of deadpool is another example of a actor who was well versed and passionate about the source material. most unsuccessful examples come from actors and directors who put in a half assed performance or a performance thats way off the mark. I guess we ll see on the last of us
making sure you understand the character you are portraying is always an important thing. you shouldn t let ego hinder your ability. remember how henry cavill spoke out to the showrunner about making sure his character stay true to his core and not make a corny joke like they wanted him to do. any actor thatsteps into a role of an established character needs to understand that character in order for them to work. another great example comes from the mortal kombat 2021 film. max huang who played the character of kung lao was considered the most faithful adaption and was a fan favorite in the film despite the fact he didn t have as much screen time like his co stars. when you watch the film you see a good blend of faithful adaptions and unfaithful adaptions and the ones that are most loved are the ones considered the most faithful
pedro pascal  the dude s pinnacle of  acting  was wearing a helm  armour  walking around  and saying a few catchphrases. I have high hopes of this last of us tv show.
jon bernthal show himself reading through like every arc of the punisher and it was hands down one os the best versions of that character and he for sure added his own spin to it. research matters.
should ve taken notes from sienna guillory who played as jill valentine in those terrible resident evil movies who actually did study the moves of the character she portrayed.
producer  hey  you actor  you wanna play this well-known part  macbeth actor  sure.producer  here is the script and a few notes about the character.actor  oh no  I dont need that. I see her as a french revolutionary.producer  no  he is a 12-century nobleman.actor  not now!
everybody loves joel miller as he is in the game. so why you would think it is a good idea to change that and make it to your own style. it has no sense. joel miller has to be that pragmatic always work focus and emotional closed character that we all love. do not change it.
today s verse was good. it kinda smacked me in the face a little. Ive been starting to stress over money since I found out my landLord is raising my rent by  200 but this verse helped me step back and remember that God s got my back even in the every day issues.also I appreciate that you actually pick the verse of the day yourself  rather than relying on the one generated by whatever Bible app you use.rock on  melonie
I love the googly cookie monster eyes on the thumbnail. also that quote by gina carano about living life like you ve already been canceled is really good.
considering the fact that the halo tv series writers never played the source material the franchise is based off nor watched any cutscenes. this doesnt instill confidence in a faithful adaptation of the first the last of us game. which is a masterpiece. lol
I love actors when they study the source material but also add there on spin like heath ledger did with the joker.
oh thank God I was worried we d have a faithful adaptation for once
in regards to what you said about video game adoptions of stories where they can show adventures outside the games themselves  I think uncharted was a good example of that.
since turning almost completely keto  I can confirm. my anxiety and diagnosed dysthymia  a form of depression  is almost non existent. I stand taller and think for myself. its a better way to live for me and thanks for your videos constantly keeping me on the wagon!
joel is the embodiment of stoicism there s not much more to his character other than being silent and speaking only when it matters the most having a hidden soft spot I e real men. the performance itself doesnt hinge on his acting more or less it ll be carried by the script and what they forced him to say
agree! Ive been trying to think of which actor could really fit the  skin  of joel. nail on the head  my friend!
now thats a great casting

I was gonna say that pascal already doesnt really look like joel so him not caring about the source material is just another step downhill for this series. hope they prove us wrong but my hopes aren t high. costed-waldau would have been better.
theyll blame russia.
is it a good series and where can I see it
@praetorian  I thought it was good. its on amazon prime
I thought it was deadpool who immersed himself into the role of ryan reynolds.
all great examples of actors really embodying the characters they were playing.
cavill is the generic game geralt nothing special
even kaitlyn jenner didnt immerse himself as much. bravo to ledger.
I stand corrected
something you left out  what ledger did not do was immerse himself into what the previous definitive joker  jack nicholson  did with the character because he knew he wasn t jack nicholson. ledger took his own approach to the same character. so why are you ripping pascal for doing the same thing
@vagabond films  because you are talking about imitating another actor playing the same role. and he is talking about actor doing research and learning for the role he is suppose to play. hard to play a character if you didn t bother to learn who the character is.
lets not forget robert de niro either. okay so you are cast as the main lead in a movie called taxI driver and you will drive a taxI in the movie.what do you do  simple you get a cab drivers license and then for a month you do 12 hours shifts in capdriver company working as a cap driver.  also lets not forget karl urban in the dredd movie. most actors would cringe at the fact that they would have to hide their face through out the whole movie. because if that was the chase nobody would recognizance them  their part might as well be played by a stunt double. so like stalone did when he played the part  they would probably insist  that there would be a few parts where they take the helmet off and allow the audience to see their faces. not karl urban he stayed true to the dredd character and was fully onboard  some rumors has it that he insisted on it  that the helmet stayed on  through out the whole movie. the only shot we see of dredd with no helmet his back is turned and we never see his face  like itshould be. speaking of netflix s the witcher  one thing I didn t like about geralt in the series  and partially in the games  is that he is too pretty. in the books that guy is sinewy  has scars all over his body and face and quite an ugly smile. cavil delivers on the performance I just wish netflix would go the extra mile to actually ugly cavil up  so he looked like his book counter part headband and all.I also get a feeling that they will do the same to joel in the last of us tv-show. they will make him too pretty compared to his game counterpart.both he an ellie needs to look the part.
@vagabond films  not sure you understood the point. ledger knew the character and previous incarnations of the character. pascal  on the other hand  has seemingly done little to no research on the one and only incarnation of joel.
@lokI trickster g  he began playing the game  stopped because he could not get through it  and studied joel while watching his nephew play. check your sources
let me guess  you think an actor like robert pattinson only ever  sparkles   plays the emo  and speaks in monotone dialogue
yeah the writing might have been shit for her but she actually felt like jill valentine unlike this latest version
that is not even close to what is going on here
the director and storywriter of tlou is making the show
@underthegun897  craig mazin is the screenwriter of the show. he also has a podcast where he talks about screenwriting and the film industry. maybe do your research first. I already knew neill druckmann is directing it. lol
@viperchief117  druckmann is also one of the main writers of the tv show brah
@underthegun897  yes I already know that. xd
@viperchief117  you very conveniently leave out the fact that craig considers the game to be the gaming equivalent of lawrence of arabia in terms of writing.
still my idea of the canon joker. he was so good in that movie
I love your take on things  keep up the discourse melanie!!
one video game movie I liked was far cry  although apart from far cry v I haven t played the games  but the general theme of genetic engineering scientists making monsters  like deep blue sea 1   2  jurassic park world  and others along those lines have an interesting premise  of which if I ever get to making my short story of falling into space into a novel  I ll have sort of a tesla vs edison theme within the antediluvian era in which the protagonist would pursue space colonization and the antagonist would create splice creatures and bioweapons to sell to various kingdoms. but regardless of stuff Imay never get around to due to exhaustion and the laziness of procrastination  perhaps sometimes its easier to appreciate the generic fluff churned out by hollywood if the source material is as unknown to the viewer as it is to the producers.
this kind of sounds somewhat similar but not exactly to the american version of being human.  apparently the actors in thatshow were told not to watch the bbc version until after they were done filming season 1 because the creators of the american version wanted the actors to do their own thing with their characters and not just rehash the original.
been trying to  live life like Ive already been canceled   even though it really sucks that we dont really have places we can just exist anymore--hoping if more people do this and speak up we ll take some of our  spaces   Ive kind of grown to hate that word  but its what fits in this case  backalso  elon could just start handing out blue checks more fairly and make them no longer a divider between important and not important  and  only  a way to see through duplicate accounts
they should get scott steiner to play abby. he would be perfect for the role.
another great video mel. thank you keep up the great work!!!
I get the concern that an actor actress doesnt want to just imitate a past or original performance of a character.  but itseems to me that you have to try out the source material first  see what s there   work with it  then your acting kicks in.  but  what do I know   Im no actor.
its just disrespectful that the only way I could describe this they dont look at the source material they dont respect the fans the vision what made it popular smh
hollywood has made great adaptations for films based on books  comics and plays . thanks to the actors dedicate who study the past works and different portrayals from the past. Im fine with him not playing the games   but at least s he could look up the cutscence movies on youtube and study that.
a problem with taking away blue checkmarks is it ll be more difficult to report fakes.some of the celebrities I follow aren t verified  and I see fakes all of the time  and I never find their account in the list when it asks you want account is being imitated.
I watched for that day. omg it must be so hard to be an actor.  .
a compilation of melonie saying  buuut  would be funny.
I never thought I d say this but  we need abby.  someone should tell him about his fate. lol
yea  God forbid that our beloved joel be recreated faithfully as the character we all know and love.... cough cough  looking at you master chief.
this girl is feisty and owns her opinions without backing down. as the joker put it  there is some fight in you  I like that!  I love melonie s personality.
not all videogame adaptations are bad  I think tombraider with angelina jolie was a pretty good adaptation to the big screen. 1. they adapted lara croft perfectly and 2. it was a good popcorn movie with a good original story that is based on the adventurous nature of lara croft. but that was another era of the art of movie making. the problem with modern day hollywood writers however  its that those are all unI of colombia graduates with zero life experience and the work ethic that makes even a turtle look fast and agile  which if you are lucky dont totally stuff their mentally ill progressive extremist politics in your face.
so pedro pascal wants to portray pedro pascal instead of joel  the character he is suppose to be portraying...I guarentee he doesnt even do the southern accent. who wants to place bets
if he is treating joel like that then I cant wait for abby
all I canthink of when you talk about video game to movie adaptations is the super mario bros. movie. man  that one hurt
yeah  I think the blue check mark on twitter got way out of hand.  I think it originally started as a way for  celebrities  to have verified accounts so that us plebs would know it was actually them and not an imposter.  now a certain side likes to flaunt them like it makes them superior to others.
big abby pump!  holla if you hear her!
hahaha. this is the hardest Ive laughed at a youtube comment.
lol Ive seen cosplayers pull this off when they pretend they re in character. people need to stop hiring people to recreate things they dont actually care about. still heartbroken over star wars
Im currently watching her playthrough of the walking dead  https   youtu.be puavhu6lxr0Imight not particularly care for abby  but the person who played her seems pretty chill. I wouldn t mind seeing her on geeks   gamers sometime.
@lenio barcelos  I know I think even the actress didn t like her either. but what I have seen of her  she does seem like she is a very lovely person to meet.
I ll bet anyone could beat pedro in a spelling contest.
well in all honesty he s probably choosing his words carefully seeing as joel is killed off perhaps if he says the wrong thing they could speed up that process. but maybe Im giving to much credit.
hey melonie I just want to say that pedro pascal didn t want to study for his role for tv show series of last of us bc he thought that he would be fine and do great by remembering his part and his lines for the last of us tv show series and so that is why he didn t want to read and study his lines for the last of us tv show series so that he wouldn t have to sit and read his scripts for the tv show series of last of us for long weeks and months and maybe years to be ready to play his part of the tv show series of last of us  ok melonie. anyway I hope you have a wonderful   great blessed evening at home with your pets and have a good night too melonie.               p.s. happy easter melonie.
translation   I was shit at the game and could not git gud enough to finish it. so  I dont know joel s character beyond the first 30 minutes of gameplay.
love your channel  love your content  and especially love that you have on a nice outfit every day. very cute!
screenwriters in hollywood nowadays usually dont even study the source material they re adaptating. so no wonders the actors dont study the characters
I wonder how long into the series it will be before fans to want to take a golf club to pedro
the original idea of blue checkmarks was supposed to identify the account as the real legitimate person  as opposed to a counterfeit or spam account.unfortunately it turned into something entirely different.
he saw tlou2 and regrets it .weird he still follows gina on twitter but he hasn t defended her in public. so still cowardly
3 03 is she gonna say what I hope   believe she is gonna say   cue 2 seconds later  oh snap! she did go there!
great versus of the day God s flex game is top tier
melanie. in regards to film tv adaptations of video games.what these producers fail to understand that oftentimes the medium is the message. video games  are often an immersive and interactive experience. film and television can only do so much with creating the best possible immersive experience with the game lore setting but almost next to nothing with the interactive experience. even if done right  the shows and films themselves will never replicate the thrill of gunning down the covenant as master chief or avoid ancient traps and the hazards of treasure hunting as lara croft or command whole operations and chart your destiny among the galactic community as commander shepherd. youre just another passenger for the ride and not the actual driver.to the avid gamer  why bother watching such adaptations when I was master chief  lara crift  cate archer  commander shepherd or solid snake and in charge of charting my own way into the setting.
no wonder he didn t graduate from college with honors
I dont know if you follow the last of us set leaks  set photos and videos  judging by them they absolutely follow the sorce material very very close almost 1 1  but we have ofcourse see what the do with the characters.
I wouldn t have even cast him as joel in the first place....but I understand the guys making tv and movies these days only have a select  small pool of actors they re willing to cast right now
in theater  a show will move on without an actor.  the understudy replacement has to do exactly what the casted orginal actor does.  pastel either doesnt take seriously video games or his craft.
some people simply have the skill to wing performances tbh.
no  they looked at the source material for halo  and were like  nope  adapting none of that!
you can watch source material of a product and then apply your own touch to it. the last thing you want to do is cut your research short. thats where bad adaptation comes in. case in point- jim carrey took a deep look into the robotnik character and adapted his performance to that  even though he really wanted a fat suit.
oh hey melonie I just saw an amazing trailer for a movie called the northman and it looks utterly amazing. have you heard anything about this movie
sounds like an idea for a new store build-a-backbone
what would be better is if they gave everyone a blue checkmark
the pendulum wont swing back the other way until enough people stop watching these movies shows that dont stay true to established lore. unfortunately dont see that happening anytime soon. happy easter! may we all remember how blessed we are.
these video game companies should just give me their franchises to convert into movies and shows. I already have ideas for most nintendo titles  that could lead through smash bros. into a video game cinematic universe.
the fact that he didn t want to imitate troy baker s performance is a big tell that this guy just signed up for it for either one of two reasons the money or that the last of us is just going to be another vehicle to push woke propaganda.  either way this movie is going to bomb into the abyss!
thanks for your content  melonie mac  and happy easter! Christ our saviour is risen! and that is good news for all humanity!!!
melonie should have 2 twin stainless steel full frame 1911 .45 acp pistols  and get something of tomb raider og series engraved on them.
you need boom sfx everytime you say  boom!
the videogame is basically a movie on its own. dont know why they re making a show.
this is the same guy who wanted more face time as the madalorian
how hard is it to find a couple nerds who are into whatever your doing to make sure there are no major gaffes
another great video
good job melonie and have great easter and have you heard of razorfist the rageaholic he is funny and likes tombraider and splinter cell
pedro pascal s best performance is from when the mountain stomped his face....specifically the part where he wasn t talking anymore.
to break the rules you got to know them first. this applies when adapting something with a fanbase that fucking expects the things they like to be respected. otherwise dont go cry mama your product flunked. man  this screams arrogance
at this point if we haven t we should just give up on our favorite games being turned into a series or movies. they show over and over they dont care about just telling the story as is but instead what to put a spin on it that no one asked for especially when they aren t even invested in the character they are playing like henry cavill is with the witcher.
Ive always said that there are no new ideas in hollywood. they just adapt old ones to make their own woke point. instead of  ok  child diddler   try  ok  groomer.
honestly think a last of us tv show would be a walking dead clone
pedro  most people who end up being badasses dont intentionally do so  stop pretending like this series is gonna be a huge hitso you can smugly tell everyone that not doing homework is cool and that its better to write your own shiz in.
neil druckmann  the guy who wrote the first and second game  has a huge part in making the game so wtf are you talking about
razorfist is da man
mando s got to his head...
the irony is that uwe boll worked his butt off to make a movie story out of the games  and yet nobody in hollywood learned thatshiz is really hard  to the point that even a spielberg couldn t. is the coke well drying up already   sheesh
cut the egoistical thought process that just because you wont be watching means nobody else will
I bet pedro pascal s performance beats the original joel performance. he couldn t do it any worse they butchered his character in part two of the last of us. or it ll only be a single season or so because you know how it ends. he also said the same about the mandalorian in star wars. turns out you dont need much backstory if you are a legitimate huge fan of the franchise. based on his acting alone  Im going to give it a try no matter what. he nailed the mandalorians role perfectly. he doesnt need to be a better joel. he needs to be his own version of joel and I believe he does that well and most of his acting. if you imitate too much it becomes cheesy or insulting to the original character. you step into the batman s mask  you better do your own version of batman not Christian bale. as a person  Im sure he s a pos Imean come on they re all in hollywood but I do dig is acting
so  actors actually do this. the first thing you do as an actor is get told to not imitate the other actor s performance. its not talent of fresh spin  its trying to put an authentic performance of your own. hence  if youre doing an acting piece about the iraq war  youre told to not watch any modern iraq war films so you dont copy a performance. I get mel s confusion and not agreeing  but this is more or less a hit piece
not really a fan of pedro but then again wasn t really a fan of the game either but I like you so Im commenting
he didn t do his research on donald  kyle nor joel. interesting. good thing there was no source material for mando. he likely didn t read any novels for the show that made him famous either.
as much as I find  actor not learning the role he is suppose to play  to not imitate the character to much  stupid since that is limitary the main point of the job. pretend to be that character. I also kinda hope they do the usual  ignore source material and do our own thing  in this case because if this show leads towards tlou2 storyline I dont wanna even bother wasting time watching it.
Im glad he didn t watch too much of troy s performance because he has to craft his own interpretation  it ain t laziness or not caring it is about keeping the core of who joel is but reinterpreting him for a different medium
basically  he wants to play as himself in the role of an existing character.
Im so glad I never got into last of us lmao.
they should have had a new cast of characters instead of just retelling the same story.
who the heck is pedro pascal
while actors engaging with the source material is nice its not necessary. the writers  on the other hand  should.
the openly admitting to not doing research on source material is basically a fuck you to the  toxic  fanbase.
you dont need to remind me  dammit
casting paaaaaaydro clownshoes was their first mistake  I should imagine their second mistake will be completely twisting the story to have joel being lead around by the nose by his more powerful female counterpart.  pass! my pick for joel was always anson mount  but that was before the drivel they spewed out with tlou2  then  like the rest of the wokeified garbage coming out nowadays  I stopped caring!
commenting to feed the algorithm
I wanted for halo to be good but so far its about a small girl who s family was slaughtered more the master chief.
the only good thing about race swapping joel and casting pedro is that in season 2 we get to watch his face get smashed in brutally with a 9 iron.
why do these actors keep admitting the fact that they didn t play the game  haven t read the comic  haven t watched the show  etc   I feel like they say this stuff on purpose as just another way to anger the fans.
methinks youre missing the point here  it isn t that it isn t disrespectful to not play  watch the game  it most certainly is  however  guaranteed he was told not to pay attention to the game as druckman is going to bastardize the script to dovetail more to his retcon of tlou2. guaranteed joel will not be the lead character in the show  he will be ellie s sidekick and his actions will have no nuance.
I cant really respect pedro pascal after he didn t stand up for his co-star  gina carano. and he really seems like he s exactly the sort of vain  vapid hollywood type that I hate.
the show is being produced by neil druckmann so the odds of it turning out bad is pretty slim.
so he s not an actor  he s an egotist.
basically he wants to make sure his take on the character isn t a run-of-the-mill troy baker impression. actually check your sources next time
@vagabond films  sure
@bahamut  you could at least try to look into itso you dont make yourself look like a fool like most everyone else already is when it gets out
@vagabond films  Im not dismissing what you said is true  Im dismissing that it matters. pascal can say whatever he wants about what his motivations are  but only the final result counts.
first!!!
this chick has some of the worst takes Ive ever seen lol
@underthegun897      what are your reasons for saying that
@allan  a.k.a. rockiteman   all her opinions are just grifting to the far right  antI woke  crowd  like what geeks   gamers doesits funny she s even talking about tlou or acting like she cares when she has said in the past she doesnt really even care for those games. I dont think she even played the sequel. she also fails to mention that the franchise creator  neil druckmann  is producing and writing the show. to act like this is just  hollywood  taking over with no care of the ip is beyond silly and Im sure the joel actor has been given direction by druckmann and others
@underthegun897      thank you for answering my question.  I will not bother responding  because your answer tells me it would be futile to do so.
@allan  a.k.a. rockiteman   no rebuttal to good ol fashion truth  eh
@underthegun897      your reply validates my previous comment.  but I will say this   if you cannot understand the  push back  to the current woke state of affairs  there is no way I could even begin to form of rebuttal.
@allan  a.k.a. rockiteman   there is no such thing as  woke . its about as loose of a term as  satanic  was in the 90s when religious conservatives wanted to cancel everything from harry potter to marilyn manson to the dixie chicks. simply disliking something or not agreeing with it gets labeled as  woke  in todays world. which is ironic because the people who love to use this terminology are honestly the ones that I would describe as having this behavior.
@underthegun897
@allan  a.k.a. rockiteman  can you offer any sort of rebuttal  because that is the truth and the truth is irony
@underthegun897      I already did.
ignoring the source material and canon is just typical of the laziness inherent in hollywood today. they ve been making comic book and video game ripoff  movies for so long that they ve forgotten how to be original. imagine  I think I ll  reimagine  roots as an alien invasion movie with an all asian cast! ps  may God s blessing be upon you this easter. he has risen!pss  go team carnivore!!
I expect nothing less from a industry that has no respect for video games and comics  and source material in general .
I will laugh my ass of if elon buys you tube next year  p
when I took an acting class in college  they said to avoid using too much of the original source to avoid mimicking it. we  as humans  have a tendency to mimic certain things. that being said  you at least need a basis to be able to accurately portray a character. I think he should at least go through about 60  of the story  to get a feel for the character
happy easter mel!
honestly  after the fiasco that was lou2 I wasn t going to watch it in the first place  but now hearing this I cant wait to watch the videos bashing it like they are with halo.
warning  rant inbound  I have a lot to say!this further proves the idea that hollywood does things to spite the fanbase they re using for cash grabs. the last of us is already a so-called  cinematic experience   so it would be the easiest game to translate to a series. you dont have to come up with a script  the game is the script.  but no  they have to  add their spin  to it  it has to be changed in some way.you could say the producers are out of touch with the fanbase and they dont understand that the people who played the games want to see an adaptation as close to the source material as possible. however  the recent success of the sonic movies  especially the fact paramount studios changed up things in favor of the fans  tells me this is a conscious decision  an effort to piss off the fanbase  and yet another way of co-opting franchises to push their message.you can make things different from the source material. again  bringing the example of sonic the hedgehog  but you can see the care and respect the producers involved have for the source. it was extremely fun to find out the nods and references throughout the movies. but these hollywood weirdos go out of their way to change the ips we know and love to fit an agenda and shove ideologies down our throats  and they ll keep doing it for as long as they can  because 1  its not about the money  its about the message  and 2  they still have means to fund that kind of stuff if they want.thankfully  this leeway is begining to end  and perhaps in the near future we might see a change of scenario  though I wouldn t bet on that. I close my little rant with thank you for covering this  melonie  great content once again
I dont want a one to one imitation of the original..
unless its a very well done japanese anime  not western  epic series or film  I truly hope the legend of zelda is never made into anything but games. no live action  just no. no hollywood  are you still not collapsed !
I dont like it when you say  thats the end of the video  because that means its the end of the video. why does it have to end haha
this is so frustrating for me. itstarted when amc started ignoring the walking dead source material. when amazon got the rights to the wheel of time series I was skeptical that they would ruin an incredible story that I loved but overtime it grew on me since I understand there was a lot of source material that people would not be aware of. than amazon released the video for ring of power and it just left a sour taste in my mouth. now we are getting the same treatment from hbo for last of us which is one of my top 3 games ever and the main actor admits he doesnt even care about the role basically. I guess this is good for content creators that I watch on youtube and alt media bc it just funnels my view count to them.
.... Imean has anyone seen resident evil welcome to raccoon city  jill and leon were done horrifically that the paul anderson s version was far superior. lol.leon was still kinda bad in paul s resident evil retribution  but not as bad as a welcome to raccoon city.and no actress cantouch sienna guillory s jill valentine.
blue check marks are the new nazziI armband
he said the same thing when playing the mandatorian. Im starting to believe he is just pretty lazy when it comes to researching his roles.
I really like pedro pascal and his acting but yeah this is just really disappointing  Im a huge fan of tlou and now Im kinda worried
actually think youre misinterpreting this one. actors usually dont want to imitate some other actor s performance. in this case  it would be the digital and troy baker voice from the game
doom got it the worst
get paid big bucks to completely ignore the source material  sounds like hollywood to me. dante s inferno would turn into dante s all inclusive convention. edit  grammar
my respect for pascal died after he tweeted support for p-philes last year.
I think pedro pascal is just acting at acting.
@allan  a.k.a. rockiteman   so what is false or inaccurate about what I have said
@underthegun897      ever heard the expression  cannot see the forest for the trees    you should get to know that one.
I would say mimicking source material is not a bad thing...
@adrian h  not necessarily  but an actor has to put their own take into something. otherwise  they will just be seen as a copy by people experiencing the media. yes  we want it to be truthful to the original  but another take can be a good thing. if it was just joel from the game  why would I not just play the game
the thing is if they do want to do a reimagination  that advice would be correct. but if they want to do a faithful adaption  then you better mimic the fuck out of that character or you are in a world of pain. add your own little twists  that is fine  but you need to recognize the source character at a glance  otherwise why would you even bother with taking up source material at all.
@markus gutjahr  like I said  if its just the character from the game  nothing new  why not just play the game. give us what we love about the character  put your own spin on it  give us something new to enjoy about the character. as someone who has played the game  why would I sit there and watch the same thing when I could have more fun playing the game
@fafnirable1  gee because maybe  just maybe not everyone is a g a m e r   Im sorry but I d rather see a carbon copy than a huge risk like heath ledger was. those some once in a big bang  no need to expect that from all actors!!
@androvsky  what about the fact that the scenes and walkthroughs  just like it was mentioned in the video  have been on the internet for years. Im saying  give us what makes the character great  but gives us a new spin on it. I really dont understand why that concept is so alien...
@knox2don  because there is money to be had  thats why remakes and adaptations are even a thing. its a loved game  with a popular actor as the lead  its gonna bring money. but  if they just do a 1 for 1 adaptation  there wont be longevity. the demographic for this is the gamers who have played the game or fans of the actor. it is also a symbiotic relationship. if it does well  it could also drum up interest in the original  bringing more sales. instead of asking for a 1 for 1 adaptation  we should hope it does well with whatever it brings. that will bring more people in  including those that might not have had the chance to experience it
@androvsky  and thats why you should shut up about actors and acting
very true that its not about the money. but about sonic  I hated the way the fans bullied the studio into changing things. if you dont like it  just dont watch it. otherwise  you are annie wilkes. the movie makers honestly thought it would be cool for sonic to look a bit like a hedgehog  there was no evidence of any agenda there.and I hate the way the fans now praise the studio for changing it. they had to do it  otherwise the fans were going to have a conniption fit. it never makes sense to praise someone for doing what you forced them to do. its like a parent thanking their child for cleaning their room.unpopular opinion  I know  and im not a  wokie  at all. I just feel that in that moment  the non wokies acted just like wokies.
to be fair twd went away from the source material with the writer being the same guy that wrote the comics.
I finally watched the mandolorian. and it was great  but gina carano was such an amazing character and big part of the show. honestly I hope disney suffers the consequences of their decisions. also I agree outside of the mandolorian show  pedro is pretty repulsive.
allowing that I dont think Ive seen the tomb raider movies  I dont think that there has ever been a good video game movie.
cant wait to see what their clickers are like.
I cant stand pedro mostly because of his terrible takes online. however the main reason most movie adaptations of video games fail is because they dont stick to the source material nor do they respect it.
I had made a comment   but   as melanie went on   she made my exact points   so   I deleted.   sigh
pedro s a cool  popular actor  but cant we get a grisly white guy to play the grisly white video game character
an innacurate portrayal of joel couldn t possibly any worse than the part 2 game already is.
of course he didn t - these people dont care about the franchise. its about quantity over quality - they re not interested in a good story - they re only interested in cash.stop giving them your money and maybe they ll course correct.maybe  just maybe  they ll make something with care  passion  thoughtful writing- maybe not
oh God  what a stupid view on pedro not playing the game. seriously  he is going to bring something new in  and the actors are told what to do. pascal is a great actor  I had my doubts at first too  but I seriously think your argument is poor. juat dont watch the series at all  if its a problem that pedro didn t play the game. druckmann stated that this will be the most accurate adaption  which makes me a skeptical  but you better think a better argument than  oh he didn t study the character . dont judge before seeing it.
he doesnt care about the role because he knows his character will be killed with a golf club in the first episode of season 2.  everybody go watch sonic the hedgehog 2 instead!  goboom
the last of us was such a great game.  the surrogate father daughter relationship between joel and ellie was such a core element to the story.  then the sequel came and they woked it up and destroyed the franchise.  I really hope they dont take from the second game for the tv show and destroy the show before it even starts.
dont even get me started on tlou2 no melonie  please  get started on that lol. the world of gaming journalists needs a reality check on that game from someone who has a functioning brain.
eh. actors each have their methods. some fully immerse themselves  and figure out a way to honor that in their performance. others only want to get a feel for it  so that they get steered in the right direction. and there s absolutely nothing wrong with either one  or everything in-between... actors only need to make a character their own  otherwise we get a situation like jody whitaker in doctor who.
melonie I watch tomb raider cradle of life yesterday n say melonie is right angie was a perfect lara craft
joel is a bland basic character and the last of us 2 proves that by killing him off and not allowing real depth besides emotional hick he wants a daughter figure over a 15  chance of finding a cure.
considering how trash the 2nd game was  I can care less about the entire franchise.
can anyone tell me what the things are in her picture Im new here and I have no clue what that is supposed to be or what it is a reference to or just wtf it is Im looking at   the blue and red shit   next to her ears or her head if its not clear what Imean   you know the thumbnail picture
the problem with pedro is he s too short and doesnt have the right build body wise to play joel
the show is going to be a dead beat dad and the woman will tell him what to do
I actually really liked the first one. I just rewatched it this week  and it holds up. angelina jolie really captured the basics of the original lara croft  fun-loving  gun-loving  butt-kicking  adventurous-just-for-the-hell-of-it  romantically unattainable  and sexy af. the second one was kind of dull  and the reboot I never even bothered watching. there is zero chance that alicia vikander could pull off lara.
mortal kombat 95
I disagree. part 2 was good also. the game play is incredible. I feel many overreacting to thatsocial media stuff. I wont lie I listened at first then played for myself and wasn t disappointed
yes please. I second this. tlou2 is literally what motivated me to move to nintendo after being with sony since ps2.
actors are pretenders  not rockstars  not painters  not poets  not directors. they are paid to emulate  copy paste  not to take a huge dump on the source material. I bet gary oldman would slap the shI outta pedro
@androvsky  the actors aren t writers. or directors. or producers. they re going to give the performance that is demanded of them by the people in charge. pablo schreiber could have been the biggest halo fan in the world  and his performance would still be taking  a huge dump  on the source material because what s he going to do about it  there s more actors where he came from.
pascal is a horrible casting for joel.also  why would you make a live action adaptation out of a game that is essentially already a movie.its idiotic.
what is the point of making this series if he doesnt want to inmitate the charc that mindset of not researching the charc is stupid because you have to know who you play.kind of an example of a actor who thinks he is more important then the charc he plays why is he an actor of he doesnt care about looking into the charcs he plays.thing is if you stray to far from the material of the game you risk creating a generic walking death imitation and to be honest pedro isnt that good of an actor realy he mostly just plays a version of himself and in the mandalorian he was in the suit but he wasnt even doing the talking.I feel like hollywood is overglorifying him the joke is he is getting payed a shit ton for just showing up and just acting something out because he doesnt know the material.funny Bible verse God is flexing on us
mario bros live action is the best video game movie ever made! fight me! nah j k the more you ignore the game the more the movie is just stealing the setting and characters because they can not create only destroy.
red flag!!!!!!!!!  people whenever you hear something like this from anyone  especially from holywood  you must know this is going to be trash. you dont believe me  look at the halo tv show  the show runners admitted they never played the game. look how it turned out...  now  some of you might probably say   well  he s the actor he s not writing the character.  this is just as bad and precisely the reason to why this is God awful. he s playing the main character of the story so not preparing for the role such as playing through the game and knowing all internal struggles of the character and understanding his motives  is the perfect recipe to butcher the character in the most terrible way possible.so basically he s going for a all-new-fresh version and this isn t going to work because this isn t the character we all knew a grew up with. I guess they dont care about staying true to the soul material since they had the audacity to change him in part 2. at this point I know this is going to be a cluster fuck. anything these days is just pure trash because they incorporate shitty ideas nobody asked instead of following what is already established and worked.
I would love   to go boom boom
joel is going to be an abusive father who tries to use her to forgive himself after leaving bruises on his own daughter and leaving her to her fate during the day 1 of the plague  just watch.
lou is my favorite game of all time and I am in no way interested in this at all. I will not have the game ruined for me.
people like you are just never happy. you want it on screen but you dont want it to be a copy paste because then you ll say   just play the game    doing research might just unconsciously influence the performance.
so he does not want to  imitate  an established character ! ! !then why to fuck did he take this role ! !its like saying  I dont want a pie.   while stuffing yourself with one.if he does not want to  imitate   then he should play an original role.
I agree with mel... its lazy and you dont care...
00 11 has the soul of a white girl
surprise pikachu face
cool
he is actually a wonderful actor but I just dont like  the last of us . never understood why its even called a  franchise  when it only had one game till just last year.
video game live action adaptations suck anyways
hI  mel!! its me!!
he looks nothing like joel. that was enough for me to be uninterested. never mind his politics
I dont really like pedro pascal as an actor
commenting on a comment re twitter.  I think it would be fun to turn every leftist s blue checkmark red  and give conservatives blue checkmarks. then sit back and grab the popcorn
you stated the core issue it just plain laziness on the part of pedro  pascal typical behavior of hollywood actors as game of throne alumnI best example is george r r martin its author told a story of being at wrap party for tv production in early seasons and actors were coming up to him asking him the fate of their characters which made him realize none had made an effort to read the books or even thumb thru them to see if they had a job yeah just plain lazy love your commentary you should remind viewers they can support you on subscribestar just mention the link
no  I dont believe you. because look at heath ledger in the dark knight  bill sk rsgard in it  stellan sk rsgard in dune  rebecca ferguson in dune  and countless others. if you tell me any of those were trash  youre either lying to keep your argument afloat or really are that unknowledgeable
@vagabond films  they made character study to bring awesome perfromances which is the total opposite apporach to pedro s. youre delusional thinking he s going to do right by joel if he barely put any effort to learn about the character.
@joans  he watched his nephew play the game and studied joel s character as he went along. sounds like some study to me. and thats leaving out the script for the show  which  being cowritten by the game s creator himself  will more than likely give him the right material for who joel is as a character. and itseems like you just completely glossed over who I listed. heath ledger  didn t take any inspiration at all from either caesar romero or jack nicholson and took his own way. bill sk rsgard  knew he wasn t better than tim curry so just played out his take on a clown. stellan sk rsgard  read the book once and put it aside to focus on what the script said because he knew the difference between the novel and the film. rebecca ferguson  the real kicker  didn t even finish the book  knew virtually nothing about lady jessica  took only what the script and denis gave her  and ended being arguably the best performance in the movie. get it through your head that distancing oneself from source material can be beneficial
@vagabond films  in this case it wont especially after they abused the character of joel in part 2. I dont trust neil anymore since he likes retconing everything from part 1. you also you like picking example of actors  I can do the exact same. look at henry cavil  joaquin phoenix  robert parttinson  leonardo dicaprio  Christian bale  the list goes on. it is legitimate how people feel conrcner about what itsaid because it looks plently lazy and lack of passion for the project he s working on. also he saif watched but how much is it exactly  I dont believe a second he jsut at through the whole game  he probably watched like 30 min at best. its also a video game its made to be experienced not just watched . this is a total other experience than just watching a movie. I can also point out how disastrous the halo tv show is after the showrunners admitted they didn t check out the video game or all those many games adaptation that bombed hard  assassin s creed  tomb raider  warcraft . so whenever they say they distance themselves from the source material its awlays a massive red flag. I dont care how many money they pour into it  how big is the production. if the final product looks nothing like the original product this is definitely going to create a disconnection with the fans. they re basically admitting that this shw isn t going to be for the old fans why radically changing thing such as joel so they re already shooting themsleves I nthe foot. when I see the reception of part 2 and this tweet its no brainer this isn t the sign of a future succesful show but quite the opposite. Im here to laugh at their stupidity and how neil is going to ruin even more  his reputation at this point. dude is a masochist.
@joans  what the fuck did neil retcon from part 1 !
@vagabond films  joel miller. everything he s doing is to make him a soft dad who doesnt know how to talk to his daughter. ellie also suffered the shitty writing by being constantly an ass throughout the game. joel also never feels proud of saving his new daughter  he s constantly portrayed as a guilty old man who made a mistake for saving hid daughter is getting hated by everyone    by the fireflies  which is obvious  and ellie who he saved her fucking life. on top of that he offered a life that anyone would kill to have in the apocalypse. neil only wanted to make her an ungratedful stupid child for thr sake of  making a strong lesbian independant woman talking down over her lonely cis-white old man.  fucking writting making look weak while he was total the opposite of that in tlou1 and proud of finally doing what he failed 20 years ago   saving his daughter.part 2 was made to retcon everyithing from the first game to portray him as a bad loser to make their new character abby. she shines in comparaison because the woke ridiculous ideology has to show that women are better than men for some reason.
I cant escape the white part of me. Im even 3 hours hours early minimum at airports too
dont really care about last of us anymore. its just ruined to me.
who cares about getting the story or characters right when the only goal here is shoehorning in your own personal politics  take that gamergators...the movement that wasn t a thing when it was happening  and is now responsible for everything after it ended.
I dont even understand the concept for the movie. why would you make a movie based on a game thats already almost all cinematics
he was the wrong choice to begin with. not that I am gonna watch the trash anyway.
I never cared for the last of the us. in fact  naughty dog hasn t made a good game since crash team racing.
not sure about pedro  but I know I dont care about the show. naughty dog destroyed all my interest in anything the last of us with part 2.
adding to the shitlist with halo and rings of power.
this show may not be that good
paul w.s anderson got some of the cast and the production staff of the 1st resident evil movie to play some of the games that were released at the time to understand the series. pedro pescal is an overrated actor
I dont look engineering textbooks when im task of building stuff so I dont get influenced by years of establish knowledge........ plz dont call me lazy okhayy......  on a serious note live adaption is butchering any established story for  reasons  and being lazy to read a game review or watch a 3hr stream on yt with commentary explaining the role u r about to be paid for here I gave up tbh
pedro as a human being is a sad excuse.
after how they went cringey level woke  on last of us 2  I have zero hopes in this tv show as well. pedro isn t perfect. in real life he is also lefty woke with a trans brother.
the witcher netflix show sucks  henry is not at fault.
so what
I will not be watching this abomination and I hope it fails miserably
oh no.....this has all the hallmarks of being bad. from not really knowing the source material to the mention of  subverting expectations   Im definitely not optimistic at all. stay tuned for a healthy dose of  the message  in this series as well.
pedro is a below average actor at best.  he s had one good role and the mandalorian ain t it.  thats an overrated show big time
why dont actor take there roles seriously any more what happened to actually researching roles and bringing the original material to life in cinema
this is gonna flop  big time
first one was good  second one..  they assassinated joel with a golf club  lol.
you mean the message of what love can do to someone in a ravaged world  you know  the message of the game.
pedro pascal is in it as joel  I hope the movie opens up with the golf scene from the game then. dude is a trash actor and the franchise is dead to me anyway. as far as Im concerned the last of us is just the 1st game. nothing else is canon. not the dlc where they turned the girl gay or the sequel where the girl s journey was completely pointless and they just made it to that a big dump on the fans.
you have to feel what the gamer feel about joel miller to act like him. also its the most important and best character  much more than ellie. dont fuck it up.
much like the games  the tv show will suck. sorry to all the fans of the game  but the first one was so damn boring and just another post apocalyptic franchise that was just as uninteresting as 90  of tv  games and movies in the genre. halo has demonstrated once and for all we re only ever gonna get cheap knock off crappy identity politic filled hijacked franchises to push stupidity. they dont care about the franchises  so why should we care about their shows also  baker is a terrible voice actor. just putting that out there for funsies. he sucks.
dont forget this actor fled chile during augusto pinochet s regime. him and his parents are staunch communist socialist supporters.
last of us 2 is horrible didn t have get a ps4 or even play it to know better then naunty dog did
I knew it! Imean I cant say Im suprised. Im tired of this. they create something huge then insisted on shooting there right foot. tired of this dog shit. this series is d.o.a. Im done! Im out! fuck naughty dog and whatever production company is involved. love you melonie  keep hustling....
the last of us is a below average game.
first or second
