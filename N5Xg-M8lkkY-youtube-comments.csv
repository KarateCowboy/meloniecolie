just get a sm7b  a go xlr   m48. never worry about audio again.
I watched jeremy s videos throughout the magic the gathering cancelation times  he didn t deserve what happened  and you dont deserve hate in the periphery. you are 100  right in my opinion  we do need to stand up to the hate.
there needs to be someone like you in the gaming space that isn t completely insane. its refreshing.
I ain t scared   you just keep that mentality and you will go far.  your confidence is refreshing and I think will inspire people.I really appreciate you sharing that verse too.  he doesnt give up on us.  none of the wokies can do anything to separate us from his love.  we have nothing to fear.
this is so great! as a Christian  seeing you bring up scripture is so wholesome. praying for you!
glad jeremy got me to check your content out. its refreshing to have more people willing to speak up about different topics. keep up the awesomeness.
the quartering brought me here. never buckle to the woke mob resist the deranged leftists and save your freedoms.   from asia
sharing your channel with family and friends. hearing social commentary from a young woman with Christian values is rare these days. thank you for being you.
in todays world there is a huge demand for content that isn t constrained on ideology  especially the woke one.thank you.
tomboys have to stick together. dont be scared to voice your opinion  melonie.
loving this channel. its kind of refreshing to find people who see things more like myself  especially when its hard to find people of the sort in the jungle of youtube.
I always love finding creators that aren t afraid to speak out about their faith. stay the course and you will find you have the support you need when you need it most.
congrats and at this rate wont be too long before youreach 20k happy to see you speaking freely and giving genuine opinions on whatever it may be.
jeremy is a good guy. he s relatively happy with his life and family.... and the woke left  unhappy as they are  cant stand it  so they pick and choose select things that he says out of context  then pretend he s some evil  hhhwite soup-premise I look forward to more videos  and truly  please... no pressure. speak your mind.Im really glad to hear you ve faith in God. it gives me hope.
overjoyed  seriously  to see someone who was wronged so deservedly happy in the wake of it! .  my two cents on all the crap going on  dont complain and dont explain.  you know you ve wronged no one and that the allegations are beyond ridiculous.  dont lower yourself to address the contrived gripes of tiny  deluded individuals and never apologize in the face of zero evidence you ve done something wrong  bc you haven t.  I wish you the utmost success with all your future endeavors!  and amen to psalm 118.
Im not religious  but I respect everyone for their beliefs  and Im glad you finally feel comfortable talking about your faith. its sad that was ever an issue to people
came here from the quartering...much respect to you. look forward to what you have upcoming. . im a Christian and its nice to see someone spreading the word online to others like this.
as someone who s seen their fair share of  woke mob  actions after the last couple of years  this was great to watch. this was great to watch.
this video was surprisingly wonderful. refreshing   nspiring! the Bible verse brought me to tears!  thanks for this! side note I work with a small yt channel in a  very secular niche  we add Bible verses in every description of every video. simply because God has been so good   faithful   has loved us so much that it is our way to share his words with our viewers ever so subtly yet hopefully ever so profoundly  3
so glad thatshe has found a more welcoming and accepting audience. I wish her the best.
thank you for recommending this channel. my faith in humanity is slowly being restored.
good job on shouting out this channel jeremy
my man here has good recommendations in channels
on it!
I would add that a presonus studio or focusrite scarlett are also good for podcasting yt. very easy to use and great audio quality.
thats a great but expensive solution for a little cable whine. the sm7b is fine  but I use the same mic that matt Christiansen uses and I cant hear the difference. just swap the cables with mogamI and you should be fine. spend  40 instead of  400.
@hammer  agree there. there is literally no need to overspend. a condenser mic for a 100 bucks by audio technica or shure are more than sufficient. I d even say blue yetI is not worth the extra but if you want to go a step up then fine. but good quality cables makes a difference
@hammer  is that the rode procaster
I follow jayztwocents  and he got the mic and go xlr.  I can point you to that video if you need it.
@kevin gaukel  same mic rogan uses. but just throwing money at a small cabling issue is insane. also  men and women voices are different. the sm7b is great for the male voice  but not so much for women who are typically at a higher frequency.is jay still doing his podcast  I watch his channel and all I see are his regular pc videos.
amen
shit ive followed jeremy when he pulled the jaces  the power and still do til this day. ive also followed melanie for awhile and use to watch her when she was on gamestop tv
support from your channel bro
@john sullivan  yes. I tried the sm7b  but my voice already has a lot of mid bass and it was difficult to tune out the boominess. I spoke with matt and he said he was using the procaster  so I tried it and the feedback from my shows was dramatic. Ive been very happy with it. its also very balanced  so it works well for the ladies as his co-host blonde uses it as well.
duely noted.
@hammer  okay cool. I work in audio visual for university of london. currently for my own personal setup just using a sennheiser dynamic with presonus studio 24c and behringer 8 channel mixer that I borrowed from work  only cuz my one had both busted xlr channels and someone ordered the non-usb one by mistake - so my boss isn t bothered lol . I will upgrade the mic soon maybe was thinking of at2020 or p220. going to get in to some music production. missed it for so long and I need to flex my fingers  -d
@john sullivan  I never sounded very good on condenser microphones for some reason. Ive tried the akg and blue mics  but I sound very high midrange. I had to go with a dynamic mic and pre-amp solution  but thats the great thing about the mic debate. the best mic you can own is the one that makes you sound the best. finding something thatsuits your voice is the goal. dont be swayed by brand names or  just get this  recommendations.
@hammer  good point  thanks for the advice
big brother jeremy s work is done here  to the quarter cave!on that note  where the fuck is trillium and her gaming streams   you have work to do jezza.
look into rodecaster pro over the go xlr.
mic sounds fine to me
@jason cook  I have to agree. both were overkill for me  but the go xlr software was pretty horrible and I had a problem with a slider jamming. I tried the rodecaster and was happy with it  but it was overkill for me. I sold it and picked up a focusrite solo as its just me with a mic and thats it. haven t had to touch the settings since I set it all up.
@melonie mac go boom  he knows his stuff  d
hI jeremy
oktava mk-012 is one of the best value for money you can get.
@hammer  its not just that the software is better.  also it can power high impedance studio headsets  like beyerdynamic dt 770 250  ohm   go xlr cannot.  its just an improvement over the go xlr in many ways
@knowbody  roughly the same price as the procaster. Ive never used the mic you noted  but I ll take a look at it.
a rode nt1 is a better mic than a shure sm7b  your issue is probably with the cabling rode interface and your computer  also possibly your audio podcasting software and your interface. agree that the pop filter will be a great help.
the rich kid setup. lol
what caliber is that chambered in
what s the  m48  he mentioned
@transroofkorean  audio mixer. not sure why hes using an audio mixer on top of the goxlr. the goxlr is expensive enough
@jchoneandonly  its not a mixer. its a phantom power supply.
@knowbody  so it powers stuff without making noise or something  cool. I just looked up m 48 and thats what I found
may just save this comment and then just meme my own videos with it
@jchoneandonly  a lot of these xlr microphones dont work without phantom power.
she needs a good enough interface to actually use the sm7b sufficiently. jist make sure you have something like a focusrite scarlet or better if you do that
@knowbody  shows my knowledge of audio equipment. lol. ive got a fifine usb mic im potrentially gonna start out with
I dont even know what that is . I ll have to google thatsh t
and good cables! cant tell you how much my quality on my at2035 went up when I swapped from a shit tier amazon basics cable to a cable from worlds best cables. there s other brands out there that are equal or better quality  but I think wbc is the baseline for acceptable quality. cheers!
the thumb nail with jeremy is hilarious
that thumb nail is straight from your kit jeremy
eyyyy quartering
thanks for recommending her. she s pretty damn chill! good call  cap n!
no. sm7b is not ideal. its a dynamic mic more suited to rock and metal vocals. the whine comes from the computer itself. Ive chased this problem many times.
surprised you didn t bring up cbc.
that was a refreshing message that is often overlooked in our day. it was pleasant to hear it on this platform!
she s an angel.
same here
same here aswell
testify!
amen to all of that!!!
I am curious how you would know his personal feelings regarding his life and family
@stacey funk  he talks about them in his videos lolhe posts occasional videos of his pets too.one can very clearly see he s pretty happy  given his attitude and word  if they watch his videos  which I have for years now
same
same
love this channel and appreciate what youre doing here!
welcome to the true woke movement!! the movement where we truly accept people no matter their personal beliefs or viewpoints! jeremy is awesome. he pointed me your way and damn am I glad to be on the early train for once. he s got some seriously stiff competition now. watch out jeremy! she s gonna pass you by faster than a fat boy late for the continental breakfast at holiday inn.
glad to find the channel! I heard your name around on fnt and yellowflash. then watched jeremy s video today about you. and Im glad I subscribed! Im not an army brat but Im in the national guard  religious  and a total nerd. Im a female living in a male dominant job and who cares! I never did  just did my job. feminists and diversity have only made the working environment worse. most guys didn t care I worked with them prior to  just had to get to know people and work ethic. I really related to everything you said on this video. like the nod to scripture  thats really refreshing! cant wait to see what you have for us!
God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change  the courage to change the things I can and the wisdom to know the difference.   I always try to remember this. stay strong melonie!
thank you for being a voice on this  Ive been watching jeremy for years and all Ive seen is a very kind person who goes out of his way to help others  even digs into his own pocket while also entertaining people by mocking the every day craziness of woke culture. he s not a bad guy  and you aren t a bad person either  I been watching your tomb raider stuff for a while too and have enjoyed listening to your views on all this stuff. I work corporate for a living  engineering designs and I cantell you that woke culture has infested itso much. for example we refer to underground entry ways like sewer entrances as  manholes  in australia but at work when I label them that my supervisor asks me to change it to access chamber because manhole is offensive. we constantly have meetings about unconscious bias  modern day slavery  woman in the work place and how we dont have enough female employees so now we have  diversity quotas  where we have to hire a certain amount of woman every month even if that means turning down better qualified people because they re men. they talk about the gender pay gap which we all know isn t real and has been disproven so many times but if you dont attend you get a warning about not attending these things. its ridiculous
so I jumped over just because jeremy told me to  but hearing the Bible stuff really is a major plus for me  you keep fighting darling  and Im damn proud of you.  take that from a random internet stranger how you will  I think we all need to stand by our own convictions more  to many of us are willing to bend with the wind rather then stand up for what we believe. so I wish your great successes my sister in faith.
hey melonie I just want to tell you that congrats to you for speaking up freely and stand your ground for speaking up out stuff that you want to speak bout. anyway it is a free state and country to say whatever you want to say bout the issues what you want to talk bout  ok. anyway I am sooo happy for you and I just want to say congrats to you and keep fighting on  ok. anyway have a great day at the gym and at home with your pets.
stop censoring people   we ll talk exactly!!! once upon a time on a different account I used to pay for youtube premium. did so for many years  even had free yt music included for being a long term customer. then the censoring   very poor treatment of independent creators started   it got worse   worse to the point I eventually cancelled it. youtube management have become disgusting   disgraceful tyrants and absolutely destroying what was once a great platform!
I keep telling myself all this insanity isn t sustainable.  seems more voices are being added on our side and looks like we have a good one in melonie.
happy to be one of the first 10.000 subs! us who are allergic to cancel culture gotta stick together.and its fine if youre still finding your bearings  new channel and all. hope you get a lot of inspiration for new content in the future.
jeremy sent me by and you dont disappoint. love your attitude  openness about your faith  and courage to speak your mind. there is a parallel economy being built as we speak  eventually that will spread to gaming -- you are exactly the kind of person I hope is a big part of it.....you are super cool.
Im stoked jeremy sent many of us your way. keep up the great work  and Im stoked that you get your strength from the Lord! I also went through a  long  rebellious period of my life  punk rocker a zillion years ago  but was saved by his grace. still a work in progress  but get inspiration from among other things  seeing young folks like you being strong and not being a woke fool. God bless you young lady!  and I can call you that I hope  because Im old enough to have played intellivision when I was an early teenager before going full punk in the early 80s . cheers mate!
Im so happy to see your channel growing so fast. you have a dedicated group of internet friends who will have your back no matter what because youre a good person and everyone knows it.youre undefeatable.
first thanks for not folding and caving under the woke mob. secondly your comment when you got the youtube premium prompt is exactly what I say to myself every time. 3rd I did come here from the quartering but not because of my being fan there. more so because Im not a fan of anyone being victim of  cancel culture  on any scale that is unreasonable. which most times it is very unreasonable. so I will continue to support these people such as yourself particularly if there content appeals to me. this is first video Ive watched and so far I can dig it. look forward to see more and see your channel grow. as far as the email goes and being gainfully employed in gaming or entertainment space. I probably dont need to tell you but there are a number of places that Im sure would gladly have you.....maybe not g4  but other places. plus if your like me it does feel lately like the tides are shifting some and more people are starting to get fed up with this bs. whether it be in gaming spaces  other entertainment avenues  or other social justice issues. so glad you are seemingly keeping your head up and you have our support. God bless and have an awesome day.
so refreshing to watch someone who is so  based  in their content   perspective on things  so happy jeremy recommended you melonie!
they re modern day pharisees.  there s nothing righteous about them.     awesome take.   earned my sub.
its unbelievably important to stand up for yourself and be happy with what you do. these online crybullies have made everyone miserable over these years. and of course they always play the advocate only when in benefits them later. which isn t advocacy. great job standing up and speaking your truth.
so glad the quartering recommended your channel. to have someone like you who isn t afraid to speak there mind in todays world is very refreshing. I definitely enjoy the call out to the scriptures in each video. thank you for your courage.
I was an immediate fan from the first video I watched. there aren t that many conservative female gamers out there  so youre a breath of fresh air. a kindred spirit!
I completely get the isolation feeling. this whole c-19 stuff has really brought out the crazy extremes and people cant see past what the media tells them no matter what kind of calm facts you bring to the table. thank you for making this channel and discussing these topics!
hey melonie  Im sure you dont need to worry about people wanting to have you as a commentator or host. I feel youre going to get so many more opportunities than you would ve had with any of those woke groups. like rippa says  we re building up our own parallel economy and wonderful people like you are going to be in high demand.
from a random south african who heard about you through jeremy  you ve got a new fan in me. dont ever give an inch to these pyscho  wokists . you seem a lovely genuine person and they can go to hell for trying to hurt you. keep being yourself and dont let these weirdos try and change you one bit. what is so sad is that you shouldn t even have to worry about any of this or ever have gone through any of this in the first place. peace and strength to you
you do you....to hell with the outrage mob and cancel culture. no sweat from the normal folks  but the trolls will come...give them time. just ignore and keep being you. you are a bright and sunshiny person  so I think that you will do well. and btw  g4tv are in desperate need of credible gaming hosts  but I doubt that you would want to wade into that cesspool of wokeness.
15 51 this makes me think of an interesting experience I had in college with the kids in the school. I wanna say they were popular in certain cliques but they weren t like jocks or cheerleaders or the usual  type of popular kids.  one thing I noticed is they did dictate to you like.. I remember jumping into a conversation with some kids standing nearby and they re like  who gave you permission to join this conversation   and like its like youre not allowed to talk to them unless they give you approval first.. the reason I say these aren t the typical kind of popular kids is because they were more nerdy  and so these are the type of people who I see as the precursor to the woke people of today who think they can boss you around and dictate who you can and cannot talk to and what you can and cannot say.
been following you for close to a decade. Im really glad youre finally able to express yourself to the fullest. being based on twitter is great but it ain t 20  minutes long worth of venting  d
feel kinda spoiled with 3 videos in 2 days! so glad to see you speaking out against the mob. you  jeremy  and colin moriarty are my anti-woke trifecta!
never change melonie. stay strong  we love you and support you.
first gothix  now meloniemac ... its all coming together in the gaming world.
congrats  melonie! I actually knew that you started a new channel  no duh right   but I wanted to hear his side of story too.all I can say is that I got your back. maybe I could join you in some games  maches and stuff. plus I still have that phantasy star online voice role if you still want it. especially when the character ends up seeing a one of the creatures I fight  but its a baby. after you seeing you giving ray charles a second chance  I figured that part you would be perfect for.
Im glad jeremy sent us your way chica. youre both adorable and entertaining and I hope all of your platforms continue to grow.
bro thank you for being willing to share your faith publicly in such a  normally  hostile place! its super encouraging and shows that there is still a place for it in the public conversation.
I think we all forgot that you dont have to 100  agree with someone to respect and like them.
advice for the future  no matter what  never appologize to someone who wants to destroy you. even if you think you did something wrong. they never have forgiveness.
Im glad the yt algorithm brought me here. its refreshing to see someone express the joy of freedom. you continue being you and youre rather funny btw
the woke mob exists for one purpose. to make sure your middle fingers are always in shape.
dont take criticism from someone you wouldn t take advice from.   you will always have a fanbase  no matter where you go.
the woke mob mentality is what put the final nail in the coffin that was my dream of becoming a professional musician. itsucks that nowadays you get judged more on what you agree with and how many people you agree with than the hard work you put into your passion. thank the Lord I have my dad who pulled me out of a dark place and right into a gym  those 2 factors damn near saved me. wishing you all the best from south africa and looking forward to more of your inciteful commentary.
very cool that you have the confidence to be yourself rather than to take the path of least resistance - I also salute you for not feeling like you have to apologize for  or downplay  your faith. I find free thinkers fascinating and have subbed to see how your content develops.
here s another love bomb comment.  keep up the great work.  and I agree  all of the male feminists Ive ever run into was super creepy  itseems they were using the talking points as a back door to date the women as their direct approach got them friend-zoned.  they seem to be waiting for an opportunity to try and date the women.
in a world of cookie-cutter personalities  its good to see people who are authentic. youre appreciated!
having melonie on g4 is something people would actually watch  but leave it to wokeists always to tie themselves to the mast!
amen
never bow to the woke crowd for any reason. well done. very impressive.
I came to this channel from jeremy and Im so glad I have. thank you for being so uniquely you   not just what others want you to be! keep God at the center of your life   you ll never stray far from his best life for you!
jeremy sent me here as well.  lol  dont sweat the subs you dont owe us anything Im mostly here to see what this channel eventually morphs into.  I enjoy being able to follow and listen to a female content creator that I can somewhat relate to.    I also like how youre able to transition between whatever youre talking about and your faith  and youreach people in such a fluid and natural way without being heavy handed or condescending.  I was initially worried people would come at you after hearing the first reference you made to your faith  in your first video  but Im glad that hasn t happened.  just hearing you speak like you do about your beliefs and your experiences is refreshing.
love your strength.  just discovered your channel this week and catching up with all your videos.  fly straight and let none kick you off the tightrope of life  its how we handle these experiences that we shall be judged upon in the hereafter.
I know the feeling... keep your head up and try to stay positive and use your voice how you feel comfortable.  I worked in a field  we ll call it health risk communication  and I haven t been able to interact with family and friends on social media because everyone constantly wants to drag me into arguments about masks  pokes  etc.  Im sick of it.  basically  everyone I know in the field keeps their mouth shut and even in our private  areas  on various platforms  we are limited to memes and basic hello s  we re getting stationed in x location  or jobs available in this area.  we cant talk legit work anymore... we cant answer questions because it doesnt support certain narratives  etc.... we basically have to pretend we dont exist and most of the people still doing the job just bobble head at consults when they are up there with leadership... and try not to contradict them.  its really sad.  everyone is afraid to do their job and offer guidance now.
melonie you are amazing and I love you  Im totally here for this kind of content. Im so sick of keeping my mouth shut on a lot of issues  and where Im looking for discussion Im often just met with anger and insults. Im called so many names that all contradict each other I cant keep track anymore
here s another verse for you when the mob comes at you  or jeremy   isaiah 54 17 --  but in that coming day no weapon turned against you will succeed. you will silence every voice raised up to accuse you. these benefits are enjoyed by the servants of the Lord  their vindication will come from me. I  the Lord  have spoken!
just stay strong  thatsheet really wears you off no matter how strong you are  all we are humans and attention to negative interactions is part of our survival instinct. youtube rewards you being constant  that may be daily uploads  or multiple per day like jeremy does   two per week  weekly... as long are you are constant in the period chosen and video length  the system wont bury you in the depths of the unknown. best of luck!
honestly just do you! and never apologize!  looking forward to more content from you!
if I was on the socials  I d spread this around as much as possible.  keep fighting.
saw a video from thequartering bringing up your situation. I watched all your videos  3 at this point in time  .  . seems like you have a great head on your shoulders and I look forward to hearing your social input.more than anything  I love that you have a spine and are willing to stand up to the crazy people who want to control and dominate others.edit  btw  great ending song!
we love you mel! keep doing you girl and dont let these haters get to you
I originally came to your main channel after seeing the quartering s coverage from the male feminist incident years ago.  loved all your content ever since and really looking forward to this channel too!
I think youre going to find your path rather quickly on a video platform  whether it be youtube  twitch or wherever. you have a lot of support.
its normal and constructive to have videos about yourself and your experiences at first  its the best way for the new people to get to know you and see how you came to be here!
we all love your opinion melonie!!! this new channel is growing proud of you!!! being outspoken is what people need to understand in this age. preach on and yes God will always have your back  and so will we fr!!!
yaaasss queen! what a refreshing take! stand your ground  dont bend the knee  these weirdos think they cantell us how to live our lives. I would never tell someone who they can and cant be friends with  the absolute audacity.
hImelonie  to be a successful youtuber just be authentic  genuine and talk about what you feel passion about and you ll see that your channel will grow pretty fast. people are tired of the mainstream narrative and why independent creators are growing faster then they are because the normal everyday people wants something that is grounded they can relate to. the small step advice I can give you is that learn to use video editing tool for cut and paste  work on your theme for your channel  change microphone  shorten your videos to 10 minute mark  work on the consistency and flow of your video  find sponsors and partners  for example ask jeremy from geeks and gamers if you can be a guest for their friday night tights podcast   at least do 3 to 4 videos a week. do these first steps and you ll make a good living out of this. you are natural at this and I wish you all the luck for the bright future that awaits you
do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.  - matthew 10 28
your good mood is infectious! I wish you all the best for your new channel.
amen!!!!
Im so glad that jeremy gave you a shout-out  otherwise I doubt I would ve ever been able to find this.  loved the content and looking forward to more of it.  I especially loved the scripture!  it takes a lot of bravery now a days to profess the glory of God.  really awesome stuff!
I subbed yesterday and have been watching your videos and absolutely love you. thank you for being genuine  especially sharing your faith. even if someone doesnt share the same beliefs as you  its not offensive in the least to share that part of your life and how it helps you get through hard times. most people probably agree with most of the values taught in the Bible if they took the time to read it. but outside of that  keep being you! you have a great personality and perspective that is refreshing and relatable. Im here for the long haul!
I listen to you because of jeremy and will continue to support you as long as you continue on this path. I even listen to the commercials to help you out. good luck on the new endeavor and I do enjoy the verses.
in my own experiences those who cry the loudest and point the finger are the biggest offenders I have ever met and seen. loving the videos!  excited to see more
got your back 100  hun  3  what you went through   I swear its enough to break someone completely   you have the strength of a thousand men also that pk person sounds like a wannabe mobster lawl freakin keyboard Godfather xd
checked you out because of jeremy  which youre probably sick of hearing at this point  lol. however  Im sticking around because of your genuine takes  and the sick tats! . its always admirable to see someone actually stand up for their beliefs and friends instead of crumpling before the mob out of fear.
Im with you on how the mob being so loud can feel isolating. just note that if you ever get really big  then youre more likely to get criticism too and I get the impression that there s a lot of pressure for big youtubers streamers to cater for an impossible amount of people that feels overwhelming. for now enjoy the ride. its been nice to hear someone be more genuine. I feel like a lot of people just end up coming off as fake  and this is unfortunately probably more successful.
excelelnt vod  mel and congrats on getting 11.8k subs in under 2 days! this channel is gonna blow up! it is getting great views and growth for a new channel! I see the channel getting at least 100k subs this year but I am sure it will be much more. I am super proud of you  besto friendo!
so you are such a relatable and normal person. your commentary and perspective is so down to earth.
Ive followed you on fb for quite some time. and always see your posts just in passing. you just made a fan out of me. I ll be hitting that notification button and watching these more often. fucken outstanding. get these poster to spotify too.
congrats on the sub count! that is really amazing. I enjoy channels where we can be civil and still disagree. we need people to speak against the narrative if it is wrong. the woke mob only has power when no one speaks against it. please speak on whatever topic. I still go to channels that I dont agree with and comment on them even though I know they will use personal attacks against me instead of trying to argue against points. I learned that I dont have to name call but just laugh at their poor arguments. one thing  I really enjoyed about your videos is your professional history in the industry. we dont hear from those who have to be quiet to keep their jobs. it will seemed that everyone in hollywood agree with  the message . anyways  I look forward to other subjects.
keep it up girl we got your back! glad to see youre doing this type of channel.
it is cool to see you trying to live your life whole and not chopping off parts. keep up the good fight. life is a journey. run the race to finish it.
great social commentary! sounds like you have a good head on your shoulders. hope your channel continues to grow.
I ain t gonna live my life  afraid. -melonie mac. hell yeah. we gotta stop letting these people run our lives into the ground through fear. I dont even know who you are at this point  but I ll consider you another individual who is sticking up for her own opinions  and that  earns my respect  and a subscription to your channel. let s get on with life.
I also found your channel thanks to the quartering.personally I think a lot of people were never able to grow out being a child. forming groups and excluding people from them just because they talked to the   wrong person  type of person  if very reminiscent of how I remember grade school being. it is very unfortunate that there are so many people like that now a days  especially when they have obtained positions of power.
enjoying your new channel!!! look forward to watching more of it!
Im excited for your channel. I hadn t heard of you before today until jeremy talked about you on his channel. I cantell you ve got a good head on your shoulders and that you could be really good at making this channel fun and interesting. I look forward to all your future content. I also like the Bible verses. there s a reason that book has guided people for thousands of years.
this video was very refreshing.  thank you for speaking your mind and beliefs in these trying times  and best wishes and blessings to you.
I love how youremember scripture and are so confident about sharing! refreshing
love you girl  thank you so much for being there for me
its like what the other jeremy at g g says  he can give out all the shoutouts but its up to them to be able to retain them.
I d heard of you in the gaming world before but never followed you until jeremy sent me over.I like the channel and your vibe.this is pretty cool.thank you melanie.
Im glad you have the courage to stand up against the mob. its super motivating for others to see. keep it up.
the more they threaten you to not flaunt your friendships  the harder you should do it.consider the case of what joe rogan is going through now. he s interviewed and made the careers of hundreds of people. yet very few are coming out to support him in this trying time.as the saying goes  when youre under attack  its not the shouting from your enemies that hurts the most  its the silence from your friends.so do what you canto support others  and they ll support you back.
not a gamer  but my kids are. I ll tell them about you. I came over from jeremy as well. I support anyone who canthink for themselves  isn t afraid to speak their mind  and doesnt take shit from anyone. keep going forward  never look back. those false friends aren t worth the time.
I find it very sweet how religious you are. Im only mildly religious  but I respect how comfortable you are expressing your faith within the kind of content you make.
learned about your channel from tq but absolutely love your authenticity  faith and just general  baseness  ! also just love your personality and voice lol. keep it up!!
jeremy sent us your way.  just keep being yourself.  happy to say I joined when you were at 7.9k so I was pleased to see a crowd had already beaten me here.  let s gooooooooo
jeremy doesnt leave his friends out to dry  he always has your back. he always calls out real injustice when it happens.
stay busy  digging the content.
you are off to an amazing start!  you are right its always hardest at the start  bug you are doing awesome and I cantell already that you truly want  to make a proper  go of this      just keep that attitude  and you will do fine  its time to cancel the mob!!!
you seem like a very genuine person that doesnt deserve to deal with this kind of bullshit but thats what public life is now unfortunately.regardless you do great work  best of luck to you on your new channel!
came for the quartering  stayed for you.  best of luck  looking forward to more content.
youre an attractive woman that a lot of people on this side of the culture war actually dont mind.  you ll never have a problem finding an audience here  especially if you ve got your own unique opinions to share.  I hate when I go simp but I subbed so I know what I am.
the quartering led me here and I am so glad because you rock!. youre speaking to what way too many people are wary of. having an opinion of their own.  this is going to be great!
the concept of  cancel culture  gets me so pissed.  the audacity of some random worm to try to impact someone s income and general pursuit of happiness is beyond cowardice.   obviously there are some heinous criminal acts that are probably an exception. I generally have a three word response to these people   itstarts with  go  and ends with  yourself.   that being said I also dont have an online presence and understand that a little more tact generally needs to be taken.  I suppose the only bright side is that the people who support you for your point of view very likely outweigh those who are alienated by it. the old saying  give them an inch and they ll take a mile  is definitely relevant here.  you will never ever ever ever do enough to please these people  so best to spend your energy on the folks you care about and those who care about you in return.
I am very glad that you are putting out this kind of content. but like jeremy from the quartering and jeremy from geeks and gamers  create parallel accounts on alt media platforms. do simultaneous uploads of every video. include links to all of those in the description section for each video. Ive seen youtube come for people way too many times. it usually starts with demonetization  and eventually winds up as strikes and bans.
I knew jeremy would do a video about you coming to youtube.  thats the kind of guy he is.  he sticks up for his friends and helps them out.
so true about the kids who would try and tell you who you could or couldn t be friends with. I have my own experience with that... it was kinda traumatic.
youre awesome  melonie. keep up the excellent work.
you know jeremy is a good guy when psychopaths are trying to tear him down.
this is awesome!
solid point made there with how the woke aint actually for any group since anyone from that group gets ostracized for speaking out.  Im gonna use that one.  melonie we need people  especially white women  that will speak out against the woke mob.  they wont listen till enough people that look like them start doing what youre doing and saying how crazy they are.  keep doing what youre doing and you will have many more people showing up and willing to support you and your message.  you ll be huge in no time.  watch.
atta girl! Im glad jeremy directed me to this channel  it is so refreshing to see someone willing to speak their mind freely.
I like watching jeremy s videos. and you are a awesome person too. forget those losers who think they control everything and like to play God. let them be stupid. you are best as yourself anyway not being fake and plastic like most of the woke mob truly are. be you cause we like you being you. keep the videos coming. love the Bible references too cause it fits the subject to the video too. hit them with truth and soon they will scatter like flies.
that is a wonderful verse. thank you for the reminder. God bless you and you channel! glad I found you through jeremy.
glad to have met you through jeremy    good luck with your channel! will be here. everything you said is spot on. and I ll leave you with romans 8 28. these morons will continue coming after you  with the friends you ve been blessed with  you have good ground to stand up and give them a good beatdown.
love the Bible verse!
I just wanna say good for ytou melonie. so proud of you for speaking up and refusing to comply to their woke ideology. you just keep doing you and being who you wanna be. we love you just the way you are!
I love you because you actually ain t scared about saying the truth. keep doing your great work!
keep up the content and we will watch and send more subscribers your way.  we will stand up and keep you from being cancelled
mel  what you do is vital.this world needs more of you to help destroy the lies of the woke mob.no real gamer would accept their views because real gamers are smart  insightful and intuitive.we are the chosen undead  the ashen ones.  the wokescolds are the hollows that infest our world.  they can never  git gud  the way we do.onward  Christian soldier!
amen sister!! made me even happier for subbing!! cant wait to see more!
you are so happy it make me happy too!
wish more people in gaming were more like you
glad to see more voices against this craziness. and if they threaten you then they fear you. you have a strong voice and people are scared you may wake more up. keep up the fight.
I have followed jeremy for a few years.  Ive watched him grow and there is no one better to have in your corner.  I ll be honest  I dont know I want to hear the Bible verses and messages but then you get into it and Im like yes!  so please keep that piece.  loving to see you grow on this new channel  even though Im new to you.  I look forward to you finding strength in your voice mel.
thank God. we need more people like you.
hey no letdowns here...just keep be your authentic self and you ll be a force. our culture needs more people like you willing to share their experiences and understanding of the world with each other if we really want affect change. jah bless  mm
stand your ground  dont back down  push back! I love that and many will do too! you have made a fan today  you keep entertaining and giving me something to thing about then I will keep watching and suggesting other s to do so!just so you know  I am an atheist but I respect your religious choice and appreciate the examples you can give me through your faith. thank you  if we were all the same and we surrounded ourselves with people of the same ideals life wouldnt be worth enjoying!
you wont let us down. we like open-minded people  and we dont need to agree on everything. but your commitment to civil discourse sets you apart. so I am not just a sub and forget. I will be supporting your uploads too!
btw I stumbled upon you on my own.  must have missed jeremy supporting you.  lol
we got another youtuber with a brain!!!!   grats on the channel and thanks jeremy for the recommendation.
my wordddd what a pretty human being. both outside and her personality. smart  confident  speaks her mind. the woke mob usually calls thatstrong waaaahman who dont need no man  but only if you have the  right  opinions. keep making content  I respect and like jeremy and Im glad I stumbled across your channel
I just realized that the first video I saw of yours was the  male feminist ally saves the day . I thought it was really funny and had to show my wife back then. really happy to have been reintroduced to your content!
thanks to the quartering  new sub here. its always refreshing to find people who have similar viewpoints to your own. your inner strength and faith in the Lord make it clear that no matter what happens to you in life  you will succeed. bless you.
you just keep being you!!! good people follow good people  even if we dont agree with each other. difference is what makes us interesting. I am a qutering viewer  I dont always agree with him  but have never found him offensive. I know you from gaming and think that you are good people. not sure what others are talking about. you guys have my support. woke is treating everyone well  not canceling them because of a difference. you will do well.
crazy refreshing when reasonable people start speaking up. subscribed
they re always a reason that there are more of us than are of them! we want more like this speak out and never bow to the woke mob. let s do this and hold the freaking line!!
saw you on chrissie mayr s channel too. youre awesome. best advice  honestly be you. the more you be yourself on the camera  the more people will like and flock to your channel.
basically what the crazy  karens  do irl.they want to dictate every facet of your life.greetings from the philippines.
the controlling element is what bothers me. it goes beyond criticising someone to outright blacklisting them and shaming anyone who associates with them. if youre going to criticise someone then you have to give them space to accept or reject that criticism  and if they accept it  learn and move forward. nobody is above anyone else and nobody has the right to wield their opinions and criticism as a weapon to harm others.
jeremy s a great guy  cant wait to see your channel blast into the stratosphere  d
you are an absolute rockstar mel. keep going.
congratulations on the strong start to your new channel !!
hey melonie how are you doing  I saw what you have been through after the quartering posted that v deo. every individual is free to befriend whoever they want to be friends with. same for you. dont let them take you down. let us know you better by being yourself. I wish you the best in your endeavors. here is my sub with good vibes. a lot of love from brazil       as drunk3po would say  welcome to the rebellion  mel! fight on!
not to name drop or anything  but jeremy sent me.  continue what youre doing.  you have a unique perspective on things and the channel is off to a great start.
I got no more heck s to give anymore! yes!!!! this gal has a backbone and I am so proud to see her taking a stand against stupid people! stay strong  sister! you got this!
I find people have forgotten that you are aloud to disagree with people and still be friends  if we all went along with the exact same thing the world would be a boring place.  talk to who you want  like who you want  be friends with who you want.  but always know we can always walk away from who we want as well.  great channel great in-depth things you go into liking the channel.also very nice ink work you have is it all black work
Im coming over from the quartering after seeing you on drinker s happy hour stream. really looking forward to hearing the girl gamer voice and perspective! best of luck!
good video. there are so many phony controversies from gaming press that its exhausting and you have incredible courage to stand up to it. more diversity of thought!! the woke types are so stifling in how they demand total conformity. this is my pseudonym  Ive interacted a little with you with my real name on twitter  Im on of the autistic nerds who has no idea how to compliment pretty ladies without being weird. you have beautiful eyes!! rock on  you got this.
gosh  ya just wanna give melonie a big hug. she s so lovable
jeremy has good taste  he s directed me to many of my favourite subs. really enjoying your channel.
I subscribed because of the quartering. I support free thought and the freedom to have your friends be whoever you want them to be. screw the echo chamber  it rots your brain.
your great personality  insightful humorous views and discipline to keep fit and healthy will bring you great success . keep at it!
thanks for being a huge voice of sanity out here!
I think I know who you were talking about when you mentioned the insider who called jeremy the worst. its really weird how left-leaning insiders have a total green light to just insult and shame anyone not on the mob s side with zero repercussions while we see the mob try to cancel someone new every other day for the most innocuous or old comments.
new here from the quartering s channel as others are. looking forward to hearing your thoughts on things. Im an old guy but not a boomer so I like to keep in touch with what the younger generation is thinking these days. just be yourself.
I love that youre a fellow sister of the faith.
Im new to your content... youre so refreshing. love your attitude  youre honest and youre right...God is on your side. keep the faith.
came over from the quartery after seeing you  subscribed and I could definitely tell you I love your attitude I love also you share a scripture. youre a very faithful woman and youre also very beautiful but also I enjoy your content so far and hope to see more. best luck to you.
Im loving this channel so far  keep it up!
great video  fingers crossed your channel can grow more. Im here to cheer your channel on and help it grow!!
I hope your channel go boom mac. keep doin you and let the weirdos get mad and cry their little baby nuts to sleep in their safe place every night over it.
I subscribed! I follow very few female youtubers because its hard to find really balanced perspective. also youre outspoken like I am  so I respect that! lol  ps  gotta help out a fellow Christian!
the comment about the mob being modern day pharisees was on point. great channel keep up the good work
here from the quartering.anyone who is hated by the cancel mob is doing something right.  Imean  the lawd forbid  you being friends with someone!  and thank you for sharing that verse.
I  too  wandered over after seeing jeremy mention what happened.  glad to find another voice in the crowd.
you want to have your own opinions   youre not allowed to have those. you should just sit there and look pretty its great to see someone who is not willing to tow their line and not allow them to control you or who you are friends with. Im sure Im not the only one who would be happy to go out for a beer with you and jeremy
check your cable layout. it can sometimes be something as simple as your xlr  from your mic to your interface  passing by another piece of equipment like a power brick. or your interface plugging into a usb slot thats right next to another usb connection. this is why sone voice over artist go so far as to route the mic cables in a completely seperate direction from any other cable. thats an easy possible fix before buying another xlr cable. also  if you get a tonor t20 swing arm you get a free pop filter. they re also pretty cheap  you can even make one with a wire clothes hanger bent into a circle then a black stocking put over it.my personal set up as a vo is a nice worker bee mic  unique mic with bee themed pop filter   a scarlett solo interface  and a separate refurbished macbook. my cables stay well away from any other electronics because I have heard this exact whine get picked up in an xlr cable running by a cheap lamp.
love your attitude and love this channel! keep it up! wokies can gf d!
good for you melonie! you just be you. we got your back hahaha
youre gonna do well  seems like you got just the right personality for this. I like different opinions   most of us do   -
I watched the video where jeremy recommends you but I didn t seek you out. a few days later you popped up on my recommended page and I clicked. now Im subscribed. be friends with whoever you want. as long as you stay cool thats all that matters.I now want you two to meet and take that pic for real!
cancellation is a badge of honor that only champions carry.  good job joining the ranks melonie
I have to say I 100  appreciate your Christian faith and I am glad youre standing on those principles. continue to push against it because the moment you give in  they surround you like sharks.
jeremy is a good guy and his recommendation carries a lot of weight. Im definitely willing to give you a chance and the fact that I liked your last 2 videos  looks Imight be her to stay.
23 04 the start is the hardest part   but you killed it man. you put that first video out and then the next one and then the next one.. thats awesome. keep killin it. I wanna do soemthing like this but I just cant right now. I dont want to get into it but I want to make sure I appear congruent with myself and everything I want to talk about and right now thats just not the case.
does anyone keep trying to make out the collection in her room  lol  love your nerdy style melonie! that needler let us cool
I dont game or anything...I just do my music thing...I checked out your channel based on jeremy s recommendation... youre cool. hang in there and keep speaking truth. the Lord will keep watch over you. have a blessed weekend.
stay strong! you got this!
it takes real strength to go through all that and come out on the other side  still sane !!  okay  maybe stretching it  gj rolling with it.. you got a thing here  and this channel can be a thing.. why youtubes tho  rumble has a lot of things for new channels to help them grow.
great channel  keep it up.  thanks to jeremy for directing me here.
hey  that mic issue might not be bad equipment. if an audio cable and a power cable are near each other or touching side by side  you ll get that noise. you can cross power and audio cables but not keep them next to each other. remember     bad      good. give it a shot!if that doesnt work  make sure there isn t anything magnetic nearby. trying a different cable could help too  especially gold conductors with good insulation
just do you and dont worry about having to meet somebody s expectations.
tell em melonie! this response is fire. Im glad I followed you on twitch and here.
consider yourself uncanceled girl  as a former gamestop employee myself I know how crappy they treat their own.
twitter is a giant dumpster fire  ms mac. you have support  so do what you do and enjoy life in your own way.
this is totally true melonie and right on point with everything you said
let s hear it for the freethinkers  Im here from the quartering. I really dig your channel  love your confidence keep killing it
I dont comment very often.  even on the quarterings.  but mad respect for putting a foot down and claiming your ground.
if you have a good heart you have nothing to fear from good people let the rest eat each other alive hope you do well and there are no end of topics to comment on in this ridiculous age we live in Im listening to jeremy years and if peeing in your basement in an emergency is the best the mob can come up with well its pure jealousy and resentment.luv from dublin
are you gonna start a paid membership for this channel as well if you do I ll join it in a heart beat you deserve all the support in the world your a big help.
the quartering   chrissie mayr brought me here  I think you are awesome and Im liking the content so far dont plan on unsubbing from you anytime soon. you and trillium  another quartering recommentation  are the most bright  positive  and easy to listen to voices on this platform.  p.s. you look nothing like thirty five you look like late twenties early thirties in my opinion
really liking the content to be honest  as a cis white hetero Christian professional in southern california  on the high end in the company  I can relate with just how you feel. though while you have escaped I have not yet  my company is very  very progressive. they are all in on poke mandates to the point where they just canned a slew of people for not getting it and while I love my job and the people I work with I cant be me because I know what would happen if I did.speak the truth  spread the light and give people the courage to stand up or to find their way out. seeing stuff like this gives me hope for the future and I welcome it entirely in my feed from now on.also I d love to see your take on the trucker freedom convoy in canada and the media slant on it.
the mic level was good today  until you get your next one set up.  I dont know why people get so riled up by jeremy !   but your mother gave you great advice - the control aspect of the mob does make it a bit of an abusive relationship.  I think I was lucky growing up when we only had dial up - it would have been far too expensive to stay hunched over a computer all day trying to find something to be offended about!
thank you for being decent human beings....setting the bar there
when you succeed so hard you kinda panic for a second  thats a good sign I guess lol
subscribed on recommendation from jeremy @the quartering. I look forward to hearing what you have to say  Im stoked that you were able to gain a ton of new subs! good luck  keep it up   take care and keep up the food fight!
youre spot on they do act like an abusive partner its disgusting
welcome back to sanity  melonie.
hey melonie. here from the quartering and love your content so far. you should look into a collab chat with gothix. you two seem like you could have a good conversation. also Im sure she could give you some hints on how to grift like a pro!
well  we trust jeremy s judgement. glad I took the time to listen  I like what you ve got to say.
dope happy you got hooked up with the subs...also according to the woke your not allowed to decide anything you do or want...deff another dope channel though
been subbed for a couple of years but Im really loving this format.
mass formation psychosis  or mass hysteria  its shameful to see the degradation of my kin. stockholm s syndrome tends to be when a person develops an emotional dependancy towards their abusers. in the woke mafias case  they are constantly abused by their leaders and they love them for it. itseems as though their preoccupations with their own self interests have depleted their ability to conceive any notions of abuse from those same leaders. that may also fall under a category of narcissistic behavior.  you cant see the forest for the trees.you cant smell your own sh t on your knees.  -marilyn manson  not my favorite artist lol I kinda dislike his music a lot actually but the quote is relevant.
keep on rocking! cant wait for every upload!
it would be hard to disappoint. you seem level headed type of person so as long as youre trying to stick true to yourself and you dont put on a facade like many on the left do you wouldn t disappoint.
you rock melonie ! keep on keepin on !
liked and subscribed. cant cancel rational thought. thanks to the quartering.
first off  you seem like a cool girl with her head on her shoulders.  so just keep doing you.  maybe you should see if jeremy would like you to put a fitness plan together for him!
new subscriber here. youreally got me with the Bible-verse sharing. thanks for freely speaking your mind
this is your little corner of the internet so build it according to your goals. its very refreshing that you are taking an unapologetic stance about your choices. more people need to have this strength of character. no one should be intimidated by veiled threats or be scared of the  mob . you are being your genuine self I really admire that. no one should be afraid of being ostracized because of who they choose to associate with. your personal choices should be made by you  not the mob. dont give them that power over you. too many of the  woke  people feel some sort of entitlement to make decisions for other people and its disturbing. they ve gotten to bully too many people without any opposition and they ve gotten comfortable with the little bit of power they get from forcing people to comply. but when people dont bend over backwards for them they suddenly realize they cant always get their way. and thats when they throw a fit on twitter. but twitter isn t the real world. I hope you continue to stand tall and just be yourself because you deserve to be happy. if you want to discuss a Bible verse or some scripture then do it. I am not religious but I respect you for holding that belief. and if it makes you happy to discuss those things then thats exactly what you should do. your community will grow here to share in your values and those that dont can go somewhere else.
youre having a grounding issue most likely signal ground but could be a chassis ground in your equipment. check on your audio interface or what ever equipment you are using and see if there is a screw or bolt with a weird symbol  it will be the only one  sometimes they are labeled  in letters saying   signal ground  or a symbol. either way you cantake and find a screw that is fastened to a aluminum part of the frame. unscrew it a little bit and find some wire and tighten the wire down to screw you loosened so the wire sits under the screws head tightly and find the negative terminal in you mics  input and some how get the wire to keep contact with the mics negative terminal. if that doesnt work then try the negative terminal on the output going to the computer. if that doesnt fix it then take it to a repair shop or get  a new one bu teither way the buzz is a ground loop in the dc side finding its way to the ac side of your gear.
who do these people think they are to tell you who and can and cant be friends with  keep being yourself and ignore these hypocrites
yes please keep up the Bible verses  literally no one I watch on youtube has the confidence to do that or doesnt live that way. its refreshing for me!
you are doing great  never give up or give in  and absolutely never give up to the woke mob.
well... ironically  unironically  you go girl
congrats on the new channel melonie  and I enjoyed the vid!
good to see more gamers with common sense. everyone should be able to think and speak freely without repercussions regardless if you disagree.
your doing great. love the scripture. you got our full support.
these people think they are justified trying to get people fired because of different views on life. it is truly scary how immoral they are.
they actually believe that morality goes out the window when they are fighting against evil.  so they believe it is completely justified in acting as horrible as they want to  if youre perceived as the enemy.  this explains why they feel completely fine with acting like horrible people.  thats how they avoid cognitive dissonance.
just keep it real and you ll do great!
you go  girl! mm leveling up!
I found you through the quartering and now I ll support you 100
the mob is all about diversity of everything... except thought.edit   and I love that you dont hide your faith!
Im a fan of the quartering and saw his vid and the bs you were going through from the woke brigade.well now you got a subscriber
here because of the quartering. gonna be staying because you keep it real so far. keep it up!
being yourself   being controlled  also good Bible verse choice! keep it up dude!
we back our friends. jeremy has and is there for us  we re here for you. stay the course  lead the way.
I never really thought about the separation of the two sides  but when thinking about it the difference between the two sides is with group a  when someone they follow says something they disagree with they just grin and bear it if its someone whose content they enjoy.  if they say something actually alienating  then they just stop watching that person s content films etc.with group b  if something is said that is off not just their definition of straight and narrow  at this point its a thread   they must rap your knuckles and set their insert appropriate  ist  here tendency  when most likely it has nothing tovdo with that.  when they say something benign though to group b it alienates them because its not lockstep thought  then the person must be corrected through cancelation.its crazy how many people dont see the differences in that and come to realization that one side consistently takes bad take after bad take.
didn t know you had a youtube! sorry about all the garbage happening to you. keep up the good work!
youre not the one in the wrong  so girl you stay strong. dont stay frosky  stay frosty!!!
always stay true to your self  and always stand by your own integrity I think its called  no matter what other say  dps am not a beliver but  as I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will not fear this industry  d
love the video  great content  keep them coming.
congratulations and keep fighting the good fight!
be yourself. Im all about gaming  trends  news and Christ. my wife is slightly center left and Im much more conservative  but we would never cancel each other. lookin forward to your channel. the woke mob can cancel themselves.
thequartering is not only the one who turned me here  but for one constant  he always back his friends! and with that one he s winning with the crazy woke mob!
hey I can here from thequartering and Im loving the content so far! for audio  make sure your wall outlet is grounded and it might help to plug your audio interface into a different outlet than your pc.
got to say im glad I subbed to you  keep up the great work
I cant believe thatsomeone had the nerve to try to threaten you like that
our pasts are what mold us into our futures.
here from the quartering  subbed because its refreshing to hear  and see a beautiful woman who isn t woke  and has some sense! Im all in mel.
came for jeremy  stayed for mac!
freedom is popular! really encouraging to see more young women voice their opinion on the impact of authoritarianism. keep it up!
I feel much of what your saying.  checking out your vids since I saw jeremy give you a shoutout.  keep up the Bible verses  its always good to have God s word out there.  Im going to check out your gaming stuff as well and maybe add you to my long list of subscribes.  if you get on rumble  say something and I ll give you a follow there.  playbutton tube shouldn t be the only game in town.
at the end of the day  when all is said and done  you ll have to be able to live with yourself. just stick to your beliefs and do what you think is right.
it will be worth it to be subbed here you have principals and stick to them. that is worth its weight in gold.
the sub count is because youre awesome. you always have been.
subbed after jeremy s video  liking itso far  hope it all goes well for you.
you know... your explanation of your experience gave me serious church of scientology vibes. cos follow some very similar patterns where you are not allowed to communicate with your own friends and families that dont align with the church  etc. being how wokeism is a literal religion now  it kind of makes sense. it also makes sense because cos is a total california thing  and I feel like california is where this woke crap started taking off. coinkidink
when the government s  or the mob s  boot is on your throat  whether it is a left boot or a right boot is of no consequence.   gary lloyd
and you got a new sub. speak truth and keep the faith in my boy  jc! isaiah 54 17 is what I say to these people.
as the saying goes  those who virtue signal the loudest  have the most secrets to hide.
I was sent to you by the quartering but I really like what Im hearing keep up the great work you ll go far!!!
youre not gonna let us down chick. it doesnt matter if you fart in a coffee can for 5 videos  as long as you have a million subs  and antiwoke channel bio. thats good enough  and you ll get there  because like I said. the huge majority of the world has a somewhat reasonable disposition  and the capacity for individual analysis. in other words  not pure idiots.
fantastic that you are blessed and your inspiration comes from the Bible. appreciate your tenacity.
more luv  to come from all of us. you got this  100
if you stay genuine your channel will do well.
never give them an inch. congrats on the subs  you got a new one from argentina. cheers melonie!
they re modern day pharisees . I refuse to say anything as cringe as yas queen but I came damn close when I heard you say that  so hope the sentiment translates anyway.
good show  keep it up. ignore the intolerant people who cant handle any opinions other than their own. its a sign of their mental weakness
love your tattoos.  you were highly recommended by jeremy.  anyone who opposes the wok crowd is a hero.
force can only be applied  when you give them a tool to wield it. shame  guilt and fear are only effective  when you let them destabilize your personality. nice that you have the courage to express your independent thoughts and not some dumb tribe slogans. it can be pretty epic  to freely share ideas with fair feedback.
I feel left out that no one has ever asked me to go up to their hotel room to take my picture in lacey undies!
all we ask is honest opinion and good faith in your presentations. no more  and no less.meet that with a grin and some good humor  and you ll have a dedicated base. here we are  now go gettem.
there will be people who will hate your ways and a much more audience who will support you! just be yourself!
Im loving the scriptures! adds a much bigger picture to the story  world atm.
from 32 to 11.7k in 2 days! quite impressive for a new channel!
excited and stoked you haven t been able to get such an explosive start... might even say its  go boom
even if jeremy did something wrong that doesnt mean he should be canceled forever. and youre right  this is play ground bs.  you cant be my friend because you talked to that person . people need to grow the heck up.
I love this. you are what frosk thinks she is in woke world  but you speak your mind against the grain instead of being a shill for the gg mafia world.
good job on the 11k!     hope youre doing well.
glad to see you on critical drinker happy hour what a great conversation. and you a former military brat. where I live there not that many military brats close to my age here. everytime I say germany is cool and they ask how did you live in germany and I say my dad was in the air force and they will say oh you were in the air force I have to remind them no I was a air force brat.
okay now my day job is boilers and chillers at a university my side gig is photography. published several times books magazines and like as well as shooting weddings even though I detest doing that. photo shoots are set up with makeup artists lights and plan ahead with model releases and everyone knowing what the images will be used for. you dont ask strangers come to my hotel room for photos. that ends with somebody face down the ditch somewhere. so that creeps me out
congrats on the subs. welcome to the culture war
mic humming might be  dirty power ... I haven t seen that with a mic before... but it happens with speakers a lot.  the way a mic and speakers work are pretty much identical  so likely the problem to fix this you need something to smooth out the power of what ever you have the mic plugged in to  so it is getting a nice even stream of power with no fluctuations.  a lot of power supply units  psu  have this built in and you get the added benefit of battery backup - if anyone knows a good one for high power and still affordable let me know
subbed. now its time to get you on friday night tights !  other geeks and gamers  leave comments and message jeremy and gary and let them know .
dont trip  just do what you have been doing. we ain t that hard to impress. jeremy gets a haircut and we get impressed  much wow. xd
just be careful you dont get roped in by grifters because there are a lot of grifters in this space.
finally  a fellow Christian! please keep quoting scripture  its so refreshing!
atheist here  I know I did most atheist thing ever  following you more than 3 years  and now I like you more    keep up good work and grow this channel more  hope I see you on simpcast  I think chrisssie mayer suggested to you to participate there
hImel  long time subscriber that didn t know u had a new channel until jeremy pointed it out. please make sure the followers of your original channel know about this one.
take no part in unfruitful works of darkness  but instead expose them  ephesians 5 11... you are definitely on the right path...
as a follower on other platforms  different name  youre great so a channel should be a cool venture.
Im agnostic but Ive read the Bible a couple times  found a lot of wisdom in it. nothing wrong with throwing out a verse every now and again for us heathens.
they say that the eyes are a window to the soul. I rarely subscribe to ppl but jeremy s one. on his recommendation  Im here and have also subscribed. keep up the good work  and keep on with your scriptures. God bless.
youre ruined now.  - basically blockbuster.
we should support our own  and give a chance to a new content maker.the rest is up to you  and many other viewers.
love your work.
good to see you posting more often on yt   .
in the words of fmt  hail melanie mac I look forward to your content!!
not sure if Im subscribing with expectation to hear more bad news that raises my anxiety and blood pressure  but I ll gladly give you my support.
she has the power of God and anime on her side
greater are they that are with us than those that are against us.
amen to that Bible quote Im the same way I refuse to live in fear
that electronic buzzing is caused from the ground in the trs connection. get a ground loop isolator to get rid of that when you turn the pre-amp up. most pre-amps even higher quality ones can have a buzz or hum past a certain percentage of volume or gain.
hImelonie thank you  so much forsharing these very important things you wanted to get out.Jesus is helpingyou throughout letting you know.thatnot everyone will get along thats why weare humans.these people you are talking about Ive never herd them before.I really dont like people pushing shoving censorship.again thank you so much forgetting this message out.my bf was military brat aswell he may not of livedon military bases bug his dad was ateacher for military.these people you are talking about is like really bad religion cult.I hope you know whom Im referring to.your the best melonie I know thischanel is new but Ive  it for you aretalking stand for something. takecare melonie
if everyone is thinking alike  then somebody isn t thinking.   gen. patton
you got that yall. love it.
keep up the good work  followers will come
I saw thequartering youtube video. your youtube channel is very good. keep on making more and more content. I hate woke myself. there is a reason why get woke go broke happens.
love your channel  youre awesome
seen your happy hour with critical drinker now I know more about tomb raider then I ever thought I wanted to know...awesome stream
be friends with whoever you want. its no one else s business.
you need to be fearless  use common sense and care about the powerless. too many people in this world are the opposite - fearful  overthink things and make power an idol.
you owe jeremy big time. Im proud to be one of the first 3.2 k subs.
majority of people shouldnt be moral compasses to begin with.I also came from the quartering channel. enjoyed his content and here to check yours out
let s talk about things  and or  do you think I care   could be a good titles for segments in some of your videos in the future. have a great one.
great Bible passage. we all need to keep that in mind everyday
love the yugioh card for the verse. a good one I find works for the male feminists   pull the log from your eye before pointing out the splinter in another s . I dont remember the exact book passage but its a good one.
hI again! love your content so far. keep it up mac!
Christopher hitchens has the best quote for the woke cult   those who are determined to be  offended  will discover a provocation somewhere. we cannot possibly adjust enough to please the fanatics  and it is degrading to make the attempt. he wasn t talking about the wokes specifically  but its very appropriate.
we re really glad to have you on  our side.  welcome.
here after seeing you on the quartering.   great channel  good luck melonie!
Im so glad Ive never created a twitter account.
jeremy s recommendations have yet to fail me. happy to support.
I cant even believe to imagine the pressure  but the pressure exits heavy handed on the successful many times over  take it as a bitter compliment  you know it and the ones smart enough to know youre in that pickle from that fact of your own success.
true gamers stick together for the squad
exactly as the mic is too quiet part  I was attaching a speakers so I could move about. gotta love the timing.
when you pass through the waters  I will be with you  and when you pass through the rivers  they will not sweep over you. when you walk through the fire  you will not be burned  the flames will not set you ablaze.isaiah 43 2
congrats on your new channels success!  d
youre amazing melonie mac!
best wishes  here to support your right to freedom of  speech. jeremy is very fair man  also for what I have seen from you  your also. its ok to respecfully disagree and have conversations about it.  honesty and transparency  are a jewel dificult to find nowdays.
dont change and you will be worth it... dont bend the knee and you will be fine   ps. and backup your work on rumble or other platform just to be safe from yt xd
you dont need a pop filter or new mic  itsounds great
we got you fam
I am shipping her and the quartering so hard right now!
you were at 258 when I subscribed! well done mm! onwards and upwards

hey  mel. curious about something  are you going to do gaming content on this channel  too
you are awesome  beautiful inside and out. keep up the great work.
there are different reasons for any kind of feedback or interference. sometimes its noise from the usb port. sometimes its because the interface is too close to the computer  or unshielded   poorly shielded cable.
keep going  keep speaking!
melonie  hey jeremy sent me over. your going to do awesome.  start with the xlr cable first cheap fix and go from there.  great content keep it up.
I had no idea any of this was going on until I witnessed what happened to gina carano. I then found drunk3po and jeremy and the force of light girls and hear about all this nonsense. the world is evil. all of you are great people. dont listen to the haters. God has a purpose for you and itseems like you have found it. keep speaking truth.
that tweet was 100  a threat.  woke is crazy
found you from the quartering.. looking forward to more videos.. awesome channel so far
you do you and keep moving forward  never look back.
you are amazing. keep strong
I subscribed  from jeremy page  but the reason why I clicked the subscribe button is because of your faith! I love the word of God spoken - point is  be you and dont be afraid to say the word of God!!! people who like it will subscribe to it and youre viewership will be of people who truly want to follow you!
she gained like 10k in 2 days.
quartering crew has your back. keep going friend and let the haters blah de blah.
Im sure hateforprofit has a lot of deep meaningful friendships.
great video!! keep up the great work.  already waiting on the next video to see what you going to talk about.  love itspeak your mind.
awesome new channel melonie  subbed for sure!
melonie low key flexing on us with those abs.  not complaining though.
jeremy s shoutout sent me here and I couldnt be happier! looking forward to more content!
I was thinking the same   I have had this issue b4 but it was a cable laying to close to a power cable. I currently have the sm7b with a rodecaster pro and have not had the issue since. the mixer before was a yamaha mx10u.
keep away from people like that melonie   3  if you go  self employed your the boss and leader of your life    captain of your ship    the exercise and eating diet thing sounds a good idea   multiple incomes
subscribers went past expectations! thats a great thing!
the pharisee analogy couldn t be any more spot on. full of dead men s bones. nice.
love you work mel.
I dont follow the woke crowd and I am better for it  say what you want when you want....love your new channel melonie
game development and media got taken over by freaks. time to take it back.
way too much woke shit in the gaming industry  I agree. I hope one day I find a company thats not so cringe.
sounds fine! more puppy walking around in background please!
great video lady  keep them coming  I clicked the bell icon  I want you to flood videos
my past is part of what made me who I am now! and these people screeching about other s past like to pretend they shit rainbow sherbet.
an enemy of cancel culture is a friend of mine.
keep speaking the truth!
Im a secular person. but I dont need to agree with everything about a person to throw them support. glad to see others subscribed.
wasn t that the creeper  photographer  that many female cosplayers had problems with
Im a musician and have worked with pro audio equipment since I was 12 currently in my 40s  so thats my expertise on this. and Ive never had any audio issues in my streaming setups like ever.. coz thats my thing. those are my credz heh... so my advice  usually hums are from interference. the only way Ive been able to completely get rid of that is to use the really expensive cables that a lot haters will say are bs and just overpriced junk. mogamImakes the best microphone cables.. you ll pay like  60 for a 6 foot xlr mic cable but you wont have any of those issues.. but what might still be an issue are cheap electronics like.. I dont know anything about the rode thing that you mentioned but for example  the magewell usb capture plus has an 3.5mm audio output on itso that you can output the audio from the hdmI source but its extremely noise and you will hear all kinds of hums and hissing and interference.. a lot of those things are just garbage.  magewell obviously very good for video capture but the 3.5mm audio on those small electronics are trash  .. I would recommend a professional grade thing to plug in your mic to. I use a goxlr but other people use mixers and elgato has the wave xlr etc. etc. just avoid cheap shit that will just not give a good signal.I use a mic splitter to split my mic into two so I can use it on two computers and I did a ton of research on that because its a small box  to make sure its not going to cause any interference or any latency. but I would bet that the xlr cable is the culprit. I would get a mogamI cable and do not use any adapters or any kind of things that you plug in between the devices  1 4 to xlr convertor jack etc.  those things will cause weak points in the signal and introduce interference.
just ignore them  treat them like the invisible people they are
well said melonie!!!  stand up against the oppressors. I assure you that you are not the only one! keep up the good fight!
Im glad I was told about you channel looking forward to the next video.
new channel  nobody start s this party without me!!
I just wanted to say...  since most of your comments are from people sent by thequartering  that nobody sent me here haha. followed you on twitter for a while. Im not that into watching streamers as I d rather be playing the games myself but when I saw you had made a channel to talk about our battles against the wokesters and other important topics  I was happy to sub
if youre using a cloudlifter  that is actually good but you will want to spring another  40 for a really short mogamI cable.. when it comes to audio you want to go premium all the way. none of that  live wire  bs they have at guitar center  some other advice is if at all possible keep power cables and audio cables away from each other  if it absolutely cannot be helped  make sure they are perpendicular to each other at a 45 degree angle. following this along with mogamI cables  avoiding using small metal box electronics for analog audio  and cable adapters that go in between cables will solve all your audio issues.
quartering gave us a heads up  the woke will be crushed. hello from australia
I hope you didn t click that link in the email  its most likely a phishing link also  being non-religious but spiritual I still appreciate the Bible verses. there s a lot of good parables and allegories in the Bible that have really great messages. its not really the messages that religious extremists twist and use against people they hate. its their own uneducated interpretations.
congrats on taking the new step in your career life. and yes  we can all have our own beliefs and faiths. it what makes life interesting. that being said  there is only one right opinion on which form of potato is best  and its the hash brown. yes  Im a potato supremacist. hash browns are the superior form of potatoes. any view different to that is completely unacceptable.  again though  looking forward to seeing what roads this takes you down in the future. but seriously  hash browns. they re superior.
that wasn t a veiled threat that was a full on threat lol.they do not like anyone thinking for themselves.
Imean I ll never cancel you for who you are friends with. but being a steelers fan is unforgivable
old school lara croft is the best lara croft.
you deserve many more subs!!
since this channel is new it would be a good time to also start up on rumble or bitchute  youtube isn t our guy.
oh  youre a professional photographer   a what  now
hI I just came over here from the quartering.  Im not really a gamer.  I used to play janes wwiI fighters and il-2 sturmovik.  I appreciate honest people who have an upbeat attitude.  I live in a small camping trailer in the mountains of northern arizona and I wander around in the mysterious and deadly superstition mountains looking for spanish treasure.  you kids make sure youread the mysterious and deadly part in a deep announcer voice with lots of reverb.  when the nights are still  I can hear the voices of dead conquistadors softly calling my name in the pale moonlight.
damn this girl is fierce.
Im here from the quartering. jeremy has good taste! ignore the haters or just embrace them
you should reach out to tim pool about being the video games correspondent for his company.
never apologize!
best of luck on your new channel  I know I ll be a returning customer  cheers.
audio is great! also  just be you. dont try to appease the audience. hate pandering lol
well done for standing so strong. go boom
we love the quartering and he says youre solid.
the quartering crew stands by their friends.
I love the Bible talk
you could try using the creative sound card thats if you dont have a sound card in the system they do help clear a lot of chatter in your microphone also you cant be everything to everyone so just be true to yourself pick your own friends I had people try to tell me who I should be friends with and who I shouldn t be friends with and it drove me nuts and as for the cancel culture and the woke they just like nazis.
all right so let s start this speak your mind and have some fun. thats kind of what we re all here for. it ll be a journey as it gets better and better. you might look to sydney watson and daisy cousins for ways they do it but not necessarily what they say cuz we re interested in what you have to say
no humming or  iiiiiiiiiiiI  noise on my end  sound is all good. now just make sure you do you  so far I enjoyed what I saw. keep up the good work!
its just like I keep telling everyone  if you dont like someone or their content  then  just move along. there no sense in wasting time on trying to destroy someone or ruin their lives because you dont like what they have to say about things. just move along. just like I have friends thatsome of them like joe rogan and his content  does that mean I should tell them  I cant be friends with them because of liking his stuff   no  because its their choice and Im not going to stop being friends with them because of it. optimus prime is quoted for these words of wisdom    freedom is the right of all sentient beings . meaning that we have the right to choose what and who we want to like. so  no. I am not going to stop being friends with anyone including melonie because they like to talk about things and people they talk to just because I dont agree with what they say and do  its their friendship with me that matters more to me than anything. this is why we have a democracy  democrat or republican or conservative  all sides have an opinion about everything. are we being forced to agree with them and their opinions   no  because its our choice and our right to choose with who we agree with or what we want to agree with.we are God s children  if he wanted us to all be the same he never would have made us with our own personalities. if he wanted us to all be the same  we would be no better then being robots all programed to be just like everyone else. make your own choices and stop thinking you have to agree with everything one person or group says. if you cant handle melonie talking to this jeremy person which I believe he goes by the user name yellow flash  dont quote me on that cause I am not sure it is the same person. the point is  if you cant handle it  then just move along. dont waste your life just trying to make threats or whatever to someone. life is short  shorter than it has ever been  get out there and live it up. enjoy everyday you have  enjoy time with family and friends. forget trying to be apart of the cancel culture trash mobs and live your life.may God s love and wisdom be with all of us cause no matter who you are in this world  at the end of the day  we are still all creations of God and he will still bless our lives with love and joy in order to overshadow the hate and anger. live life and love it.  let go of all the hatred and anger and just live.
omg youre so awesome!1 loving your channel so much so far!  3
jeremy sent me here! you are so great  I look forward to your content
smart  and strong without being the least bit hateful.  all women should be like you.
no hum  but if youre hearing hum  there s a chance your power outlet might no be grounded well. you can get a glI ground loop isolator to put in line on your xlr. they re like 10 bucks
they are freeks-!! ignore them all ! we got your back ! just sub ed cause I like your style and attitude !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  just do you and all will be golden !!!      I promise !!!!
I seen  the video  jeremy  did on the quartering. Im  here to support  you and go against the  woke mob. never  surrender to  them or bend the  knee
give em hell melonie!!!!
the quartering sent me  but your attitude made me sub  never give up  never surrender!    by tje way  hit up gary at nerdrotic  he d love to have you on as a guest
wow she knows the the pharisee and the tax collector  luke 18 9-14  passage I totally agree these mobs are nothing more than the modern day pharisee.
if you hope to join the hivemind ever again...
we support people people like you who are victims of prejudice and hatred....
ohhh you arent scared..you are one of those!! this is going to be a fun channel. herer for it!!
nice verse!  creepy like the neighbor from jingle all the way! cancel you because youre cool with jeremy !  how about that time their president said the eulogy for a clan recruiter!!!
nobody is more underhanded and sleezy than a  male feminist . I dont remember who said it but I remember hearing someone say that they are the type of men who go along with these new feminists with the sole intent on getting laid. this person also went on to say those are the same kind of weak minded men who resort to sexual assault against women when they dont get what they think they deserve.
Im glad I was pointed to here. Im looking forward to your content.
in the process of pushing you out they gave you the last escape pod of the burning ship
just  dont be evil  and I ll watch what you got
the high pitch noise could be from electrical line parallel with your audio line. they can run perpendicular  but shouldn t run parallel.
the quartering recommended you and so far I am very impressed
2 49 love this channel so much already haha
I was going to say  if you need help with background noise without buying anything lmk! it can be edited out in a video editor!
shout out to lara croft holding it down in the background
sm7b   cloud lifter audio interface! you doing great!
stop censoring people and we ll talk    this comment added your videos to my regular watch list.  glad you ve decided to stop silencing yourself!  looking forward to future videos.
I have tinnitus so I cant tell if the mic is humming or not lol
if you have a compressor it could be the raised noise floor from turning up your gain
here to represent the accepting and tolerant group
I love the content so far  as I love honesty.  I like the Bible verses as well.  my favorite is joshua 1 9
jeremy is a king maker....well in this case a queen maker. 12 000 subs in 24hrs. nice!!
love yeah stay true to yourself and you will be happy we all love yeah!!!!
I love how schlocky the thumbnail for this video is. it looks like one of jeremy s.
as john cooper of skillet says we dont want woke cookies .go boom
hey now. they dont want you to subscribe to everything they do. however  if you dont agree with something they care about  thats when youre in trouble.
jeremy was right you are worth a fallow. good job!
preach it!
I was going to sub no matter what. I genuinely have always liked your content. Im just surprised I saw it on his video instead of one of your social media accounts first. youtube just doesnt like updating me on people s posts.as for this person they are genuinely stupid. if I knew better about my streaming and video editing I would 100  want to join in or invite you to discuss and game together. far lefties like to act like they have the gaming community locked down but they dont. if game developers dont want to support us we can buy  play  discuss  and review games ourselves. be itseparate or together.
lol same.
subscribed. hope to watch more contents upload by you.
you dont really need a pop filter with your windscreen over the mic anyways. you sound great though!
I always thought a lot of these male feminist types were secretly slimeballs  but to actually hear stories about what some of these people do is disgusting. and to send a threat like that to someone and not realize that you sound like a villain demonstrates a total lack of self-awareness.
since you said it  I cannot hear anything but the whistling
Im here to stay  you seem chill  cool and your easy on the eyes. keep grinding and stay smiling.
14 23 this is usually how it is. Im gonna hold the rest of my comments until the video is over.. question for everyone here.. do you think what Im doing now is fine with just commenting on individual things  or should I hold everything for one comment about the entire video  I just dont wanna write 1000 comments. lol
and she quotes the Bible. Im glad I subscribed.
any thoughts on how the tomb raider series can be fixed or where itshould go
glad you still streaming  happy luna new years...during my second year of nursing school our professor gave us a quiz.  i breezed through the questions until i read the last one    what is the first name of the woman who cleans the school    surely this was a joke.  i had seen the cleaning woman several times  but how would i know her name   i handed in my paper  leaving the last question blank.  before the class ended  one student asked if the last question would count toward our grade.   absolutely   the professor said.   in your careers  you will meet many people.  all are significant.  they deserve your attention and care  even if all you do is smile and say hello.   Ive never forgotten that lesson.  i also learned her name was dorothy.
I saw you a couple of weeks ago on the drunkler s channel  and I could not believe you are as  old  as you are. so I wanted to try that diet too. I have been a gym rat for a couple of years now but after all those years I still cant get that 6pack. but when I tried it  I kept being sooo hungry. what do you eat in a day and how many times do you have a meal  I normally eat 2 times a day. in the morning I eat some greek yogurt with a banana and a little bit of granola. and in the evening I eat chicken with vegetables and 3 eggs. and when. I tried the carnivore diet I did 3 eggs in the morning and 2 steaks plus 2 ground beef patty s in the evening. but still I was hungry af
melonie mac is kind of a badass.
nothing makes male feminists more petrified than a strong  free willed woman. good for you for speaking up.
talk to  em  mac!
no weapon formed against you shall stand
sounds like induction in the cable. never use any cable besides mogami. I have a r de procaster into a cloudlifter then into a focusrite and had the exact same whine. I was using amazon basic xlr cables. switched to mogamI  arguably the best cables on the planet  and boom! solved.
the thumbnail lmao
I like the addition of the Bible verses.  good on you !
if the nuts are going to continue changing the definitions then they need to be required to send out a notification listing all changes at least three days before the initiation of a debate
thats an excellent Bible verse!
I guess you could call your followers  mcrebels .
thank you!    honestly I think first priority with carnivore is to get adapted  so dont deprive yourself. eat when you are hungry  however often that may be. as a general rule it helps if you track your protein  make sure you are getting 1g per 1lb goal body weight minimum. hard to feel hungry when you are getting all that protein in.if weight loss is your goal then you will want to moderate fats  but I say at least for adaptation in the first month dont even worry about it. eat to your heart s content  just make sure you are getting adequate protein. also I recommend electrolyte mixes  because carnivore and keto are a diuretic  it flushes a lot of water and inflammation out of your system and you may lose some electrolytes in that process. so drinking a glass or two of electrolytes helps a ton with adaptation and helping you feel your best.its definitely a shock when you aren t used to it because your body is changing gears to fat for fuel instead of glucose. so after adapting you can figure out your food intake balance. when I first did carnivore I ate like 3 meals a day as usual  but now over 2 years in I usually eat just one meal a day or one meal and one snack. I just make sure I get 130g protein minimum in that meal to meal and a half.
@melonie mac go boom  waaw only one meal   and not feel hungry thats would  be great . my goal is to lose the last little bit of fat so I finaly can see my 6pack atleast for a time . btw do yourecomend going true the prosses of going from vegI s and meat to onlt meat a day after you got a big tattoo   of will this slow the healing prosses   and the electrolytes drink   would be somekind of sports drink   thank you for the reply!!
the salt must flow!!
congrats on getting to 10 000 so quickly.  Ive been struggling for a couple of years to just get to 350.
you have found your people  welcome home.
I have a helpful hint for you also  get on alternative media asap  and start making alternative media exclusives. youtube is not your friend. keep your eyes and heart on Jesus no matter what! never back down.
I tried to do the one comment at the end thing but youtube s textfield is broken. it only will comment the first paragraph  first comment  and ugh. if bigtech spent as much time not breaking their shit or fixing their bugs as they do censoring people they would have the most bug free code the world has ever seen.
love the biblical verses
gamers are notorious for helping each other and being inclusive. want to get a round of d d going  no problem 50 guys show up.
came here from the quartering  you seem like a cool girl. going to check out some of your videos. subbed
I d warn you to put on the breaks a bit before being grateful for a sub like me hahahaIm quick to call out bullshit and dont care what people think of me. only reason Ivenever been cancelled  that I know of  is I dont set myself up for it. well thats not true.I really really do set myself up for it hahaha I just dont care what people like that think.in 2022 my phone is a whole lot quieter  which is cool hahabut yeah  the jeremy thing is stupid. I dont sub to him but he s been a voice Ivelistened to for a long while. I wouldn t even know what gamergate is if not for him.I probably would have found out but back then I was being hit with so many differentmessages regarding it and I knew what zq did. he was a great help   he didn t deserve being punched either  . any way  just be you and stay you
hey! Im here because of jeremy s video  but Im happy to be here  I ll definitely stick around. cheers!
think you ll do great.  my only advice for you is to be your honest self.   God bless.
never bend the knee to the woke mob  good on you for speaking your mind
these are evil people  and they will get their punishment at given time. call it karma
please keep reciting Bible verses if they fit the topic at hand  its a nice addition
how dare you not subscribe to the wokeness !
I know its a bit past-tense maybe not with joe rogan currently   and Im sorry if Im being ignorant to your views on the topic  but I d like to hear your opinions on things like pewdiepie and the apologizing culture in general. do you think its warranted  what do these apologies do to alleviate the situation  if anything  and in the case of rogan  does he gain anything by not switching to a platform like rumble who has offered a matching contract
Im glad your sub count rocketed. its a smack in the face to the lunatics.
you better earn this sub!!!
you know how to make God laugh      make a plan.... we think we are in control  but really he is....I appreciate the fact you freely discuss your faith.....
good stuff keep posting!!!!
any friend of jeremy is a friend of mine  subbed
you should make a commentaries on the pharisees   a dive into the hyperlinks of the Bible.
damn   she s cute.  the way she talks and thinks   too.
be yourself  ignore the haters. im always open to a real conversation. I dont always agree with jeremy  Im sure I will not always agree with you either  but you should never be silenced.
screw those people you got new fans now just be real and we got your back you
love your artwork on your arms.
it has been totally worth it almost a hundred k now congrats
I dont hear any noise at all in your background sounds perfectly fine to me
might be a little more far-fetched for your tastes  geeks   gamers might be another good place to reach out to... they tend to be a little more  blunt  compared to quartering  but effective.
I did stop by your channel because of the quartering but I subscribed because I wanted to. stay cool and be real.
shout out to thequartering. glad your thriving now.
let s have a few more lara croft s and a few less abby s  from last of us 2. a tomb-raiding badass who works out in the gym.... and the library! up yours  hivemind!we ve got your back  mel.
gee...new sub here...great job...I wonder what happens when cancel the cancel bullshit hits the fan...yes jeremy recommend ya...
thanks for upping the volume
I came from the quartering and so far Im liking what I see
that would be cool of you made it a point to share a Bible verse at least once a week or so that you like and think people can apply to their life.
just level up the thumbnail game and youre solid.
keep being you!
why not throw in some nutrition and fitness advice for gamers maybe tied to video-game characters like   when lara croft is running up the pyramid steps  she has ridiculously cut calves  amirite thats her gastrocnemius  guys  and its great for flexing your kneeand helping blood get out of your footwhich is especially important for diabetics so their feet dont fall off  and then recommend a gastrocnemius exercise.
jeremy sent me.youre a reasonable person.new sub  cheers!
those that complain about jeremy and you are not your followers.
well done for not throwing your friends under the bus just because the woke mob says so. your opinions are your own and you can make your own decisions. dont let them influence your actions or opinions.
spot on video!
it was jack murphy who sent the email! hahahha
holy abs...! that takes some work.  Im mostly commenting for the algorithm...  cheers!
epic thumbnail!
yo keep it
heh  you thought being freinds with q made them mad.   you just said being victim of their cancel tactics made you a better person.Im imagining their heads just exploded like in a cartoon.   hahaha
already worth it!
come to gab as an anon account and interact with folks  being an anon is great.
you do you. thats why we re here. 07
just throwing this out there  tim pool is looking to build culture and hire journalists.  you ve probably got a lot of mutual contacts...
microphone proximity to your computer monitor can pick up interference.
damnit I only can hear the hum since you mentioned it and now I cant unhear lol
God thatsleeve looks amazing.
its ok  Ive been disappointed by all my relationships  so...edit  also  as a Godless heathen  with the exception of faiths thatstill require stonings  I really dont care anymore.
so happy the quartering brought me here. once you sacrifice your spine to the woke mob you cant get it back.
you d make a way better host for g4 than their new hire... God  is she scary...
you can pick your friends  you can pick your nose  but you shouldn t pick your friends nose!
yes thank jeremy
7 41 hey  them gummies you made though...I feel like you could somehow make bank off of that or something somehow.
never be ashamed to share the gospel. specially if its on your heart. remember isaiah 55 11 so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth  itshall not return unto me void  but itshall accomplish that which I please  and itshall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.  you just never know who needs to hear what your saying.
sure the quartering got me here but Im staying for your honesty and because combating the hate from the woke mob is everything. stay you.
welcome to the cool kids club.
lol I love how those woke mobs are threatening people and harass them. and then they cry when theyvget exposed and call you sexist etc cause they are the  good ones
new sub here. quartering sent me. he we got your back chick. by the way  by  we  Imean the vast majority of the twitter handle lacking world!
awesome how you just matter of factly bring in Bible verses in every video so far
12 07 couple years ago huh. only 2   lol. you probably outed them right there even though I dont know. I know exactly the event youre talking about and it was like lono  the guy that used to run opg  wgrates  warwitchtv  but of other dudes that most of  em just all out vanished as a result. the guy that ran opg was one that really got a response out of me because literally the week before it happened we got into it about blm and he blocked me for being a bigot. and then next week it turns out he s telling women to sleep with him to make them famous. I got a real kick out of that one man. such a great example of how these woke people have some of the biggest skeletons and are some of the worst people in reality.
hI  liking your content. the quartering promoted your channel.
how about your perspective on a specific game  if you have played  battlefield 2042. I have played it long enough to say categorically my opinion and assessment of that game.
aaaaaand subbed! keep at it!
Ive watched jeremy s content for years and although I dont always agree with him and there are occasions he exaggerates things  he has never ever said anything that I d deem offensive or controversial
youre hot and seem honest. youre already ahead of most.if you keep it real  people will stay. if you dont  simps will stay. not nuclear science here.keep it up
you said its 11 000  but your actually on 12.1 000! ha! suck it!   congrats lady
nothing explains being woke in 2022 more than a random guy yelling at a women for having her own opinion and trying to be more than just eye candy.
just be you. they justify the double standard by deciding you are not human - so its not really a double standard.
youre such a dime
nah youre good. this is america  freedom of speech included. Im atheist  but doesnt mean others dont deserve respect  so dont be afraid of sharing your opinion  or belief  on things. Im glad youre building a community of people  who at least appear to be adults.
let s freaking go indeed!
sorry melonie  if we ve overwhelmed you. jeremy said you needed some love from the sane people !
I  dont even game anymore.....just here to support.
personally  I despise quartering. but I d never judge or condemn anyone for liking or being friends with him.
stream having a lunch with jeremy for no other reason than to make the woke mob completely lose their fragile little minds.
the yugioh card edit
amen on the Bible verse
the quartering sent me.... love the content... subbed... uncanceled..
you can pick your friends and you can pick your nose  but should you pick your friends nose  I have just one bit of advice  dont let Jesus take the wheel  he doesnt have a driver s license  he literally walked everywhere. lol. all the best for you. I am patently waiting for more of your perspective.
my audience isn t threatened by people with different belief systems whether they agree with it or not . how about we just republish the Bible with that verse in it
I came from jeremy. youre good at this go figure. host of a show lol
I only speak for me in my following rant  I came over from jeremy and I ll just say  if you have different opinions from me  kool whatever.  disagree with me  sweet.  just please  please  please dont ever say I ever disagree with you or such because Im a  fill in the insult  and you wont let me down at least. low bar I know  but almost everyone keeps breaking itso yea. Im interested in your takes from the vids you posted so far and am excited to see more. I personally dont need you to bash on others 24 7 as I believe we need to build culture rather than just complain.  not to say you are  in fact the opposite  which is why I subbed. just continue to be yourself   talk about what you like  and you have my sub. best of luck. I really hope you go far
just put anything you want on here. we cant control you  good luck.
I hear no humming  sounds good to me. fight the power. I find your  fuck em  attitude very refreshing. I am not religious in the least and I wouldnt talk shit to anyone who is  youre free to believe whatever you like. hope this channel blows up for you im digging your outlook
I find it interesting that all the people who tell other people to disassociate from jeremy always cite the same misrepresented  or outright false  reasons. I know they believe they are righteous  but they also have to know that they cannot  in any real way  support anything they say. and thats generally not the making of a strong position.
its probably a grounding wire issue
the woke mob mentality worked for the nazI party  national sozialistische deutsche arbeiter parteI national socialist german worker s party  worked for union of soviet socialist republics  worked for people s republic of china with mao s great leap forward cultural revolution with the red guard and mao s little red book.anything short of child bad stuff and snuff films  the market decides for me what I ll indulge. lately Ive been replaying the original silent hill and metal gear solid trilogies on sony playstation 1 and ps2.
do what you want to do.
in my opinion everyone has the right to have their own opinion even if I disagree with them  because Im a firm believer in freedom of speech and anyone who tries to silence anyone is in the wrong  freedom means freedom not censorship and destroying people s lives
I dont want to be a token woman...  I dont think there s anything more sexist than hiring a woman just because she s a woman  meaning she s looked at only as a box to be checked. change my mind.
I think I have heard from other creators saying they use a yetImic.
funny the folks thatscream the loudest about all this injustice are the ones committing the most of the injustice. stand firm  you got a legion behind you now. let them come.
slay queen yasss
just joke yall just jokes
what if I told you ephesians 6  isn t talking about roman battle armour but gladiator armour.  think about it   a soldier doesnt need to be told to gear up.  the ones who failed that test are already dead.  but a gladiator   well  they were not only told to gear up  but what they would be wearing.the author if ephesians  was also a sports fan  there are numerous references and metaphors for competition sports in his writings.  from racing  wrestling publish...but look at the armor described in eph6   specifically the shield of faith  which  ...extinguishes the flaming darts of the enemy...   consider that the Bible often refers to the tongue as a flame  a weapon  a tool to create or destroy.now consider that a gladiator often lives and dies by the will of the audience.now consider what happens to a Christian  whenever their faith is revealed before the public.  woke identitarians being the worst  most cruel  of these.how like an arena no   they re all watching  scouring your every thought  action  word and deed for anything they can use against you.  any reason to declare your doom.gear up gladiator.  dont forget you have a sword too.
its disturbing that the far left - who control the narrative - view jeremy as  far right . its the label they give to anyone they disagree with.
16 33 whoa melonie about to go boom in 3 2 1     I feel ya babe.
its so ridiculous. I played in a band with a mix of conservatives  independents and liberals  and we got along fine. we didn t put our entire identities in politics. how sad for those who do. I have friends across the political spectrum  and only a few got all bent like little girls and broke the friendship because I held a certain view on a topic. good riddance. they can go live in their echo chamber and be bitter souls. I ll never unfriend someone for their political views.
et voil ! thank you jeremy !   from france
g4 should fire everyone they have and hire you right now.
I am not a religious person  but I am not a woke acolyte  so Bible verses are not offensive. in fact  jordan peterson has gotten me to at least appreciate them.
Im sure you will get a few nice microphones.
well  I am not a beliver  but the Bible has lot of wisdom in it.
look at the camera  aka audience more.  connect with them that way.  also  looking away is a tell for being untruthfull.  you dont want to give that impression.
feminism in action. we all need to push back. way to go melonie.
cancel culture  is nothing new and is not exclusive to any one political side or party. growing up in the 90s  I remember religious right wing nutjobs freaking out over artists like korn  marilyn manson and eminem  wanting them removed for being  satanic  or  demonic . I remember in the early 00s when the dixie chicks were kicked off radio and had their cds burned by  patriots  because they spoke out against george w. bush and the iraqI war. I remember them wanting to ban and burn many different books by many different authors.
are you ever going to join the cast of geeks and gamers
dont worry about the haters...the silent majority is getting extremely fed up with the woke mob...you do you! scouts out and airborne all the way kiddo
isn t thta black thing a pop filter  Imean it also filters out wind noise but its supposed to help with pop..
there s potential for a non-woke gaming channel to rival the dumpster fire that is the g4 reboot.  just because the  woke  gaming industry may not be an option  there might be a hell of an opportunity here.
Ive seen more people lean on the book in the last 4 years then ever in my life. people out here are confused and find solace in the book both believers and non.
I came from the quartering  and stay for the eye candy... holly fugde how do you look this great at 35.. I need to work out haha
wait a minute - are you trying to say that a Christian  outspoken  not woke gal  or anyone really  will have a hard time getting a job in the gaming industry ! shocked! I am shocked!
the quartering sends its regards
how dare you objectify this young lady!I only did it for like 2 minutes tops...
also  hit up the daily wire. they ve got the right idea. we  the non too far left  are going to have to start making our on economy. that includes everything  gaming channels and media content included. maybe you can pitch yourself as someone who can start the foundations of that. I can guarantee you that if nothing else  you come up with a pitch  they ll will at least listen. something to think about. oh  and yeah I dont give 2 damns if you wanna be a damn woodchuck  and identify as such  I dont care if you voted for hillary  granted thats pushing my limits  but I digress lol  I dont care if youre a democrat  just as long as yourealize that your backlash is stemming from thatside  so until the party gets some of its former sanity back  dont vite dem  but thats not to say dont try and reintroduce reason from the inside. my point is  we dont care! do you  but it d be nice if you could stand and fight with us  so we can do all we canto save this..... civilization  dont wanna limit it to geography. this is an all out assault on our entire civilization  not just one nation.
I d have thought someone who reads Bible verses on her videos would be considered far more conservative than jeremy.  how does this even make sense   there s gotta be something else going on.  something deeper.
did you see that lara croft statue on sideshow collectibles  I know you are a fan so thought I d mention it.
anyone with half a brain can see the woke movement for what it is  bullies disguising themselves as  tolerant  and  enlightened  people. I am so sick and tired of the type of  feminism  that thinks I should love characters who are undeserving of the praise they get. characters that did nothing to build up the  greatness  of themselves that the woke culture want us worship  except being born a certain gender and or ethnicity etc. characters that are rude and obnoxious to other characters around them who are betrayed as weak because they dont fit the woke idea of a  good  character instead of being gracious to them. characters that are unsympathetic  busybodies that can do no wrong  who cannot ever be unsuccessful in anything that they do and that every other character just like straight away without that feeling being explained in any way. respect is earned  greatness comes from struggle  knowledge comes from learning and friendship comes from kindness. anything else is just lazy writing and if you want diversity  gender etc. done right  it has to neutral. women cannot be elevated over men or it becomes misandry. there s no place for any of that crap in society thatstrives for real equality.
salutations from the quarterings...
we need more Christians in the culture. the only reason america was as great as it ever was  is due to the 10 commandments being the basis of the moral law. period. there s a difference between being preachy and being a Christian living your life and doing your career. there s no such thing as a private Christian. you are or you aren t. it is one of those things that everything else is built on top of. fundamental  to use a  cringe  word.
just admit it you talk to bearded men on the internet its ok it happens
you need to talk to the other guys from g g
worth it to be subbed  lol. youre so sweet and considerate! but clearly worry way too much
from the quartering....keep it up.

Im here from the quartering.  just fyi.
you are so intelligent!
dont ever kneel to the mob. I dont agree with anyone on every single thing because that wouldn t make any damn sense. I dont agree with you on every single thing  but thats what makes the world great-- we are all allowed to have differing opinions and the most important thing we can do is be kind to and tolerant of one another. always stay true to yourself  and if someone wont hire you or work with you because they dont agree with something you said or someone you are friends with  that is in and of itself a form of hateful and intolerant oppression. f the haters and power through!
came over from the quartering

best thing you can do about the mob is pray for them.  they need Jesus just like the rest of us.

jer-bear brought me here

its literally a cult. pretty amusing they are saying the same about us like minded individuals.
you will reach 1m  sub by end of the year.  road to hell is paid with good intentions. evil   deception.
its the cult of woke. what did you expect the cult part in the cult of woke to be
lets fucking goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
thats what happens when mid- jeremy shills for you. we must obey!
if male feminist were any more creeper they would turn green and start hissing

came from quartering.  note because he said so  but r because of the injustice you befell.
for the algo
its fine wih me that youre friends with jeremy from the quartering.  you could be friends with woke people.  I dont see why thatshould be an issue.

good people in you comments! peace
cult of woke
its a cult. the way the act and treat people is like a cult.
I dont hear a hum
hI  I come from the  quartering
so are you single
there are plenty of conservative libertarian gamers out there.  we are not all wokeies.
yes... let the misogyny flow through you. let it dictate your every action  your every video. use it... for power.
no anime stuff  only tomb raider nooooo halo gun nice
life s hard when youre a pretty girl
hey  Im new
that email was incredibly idiotic. if you have politically right or right leaning views  that isn t going to prevent you from gaining a job in this field. honestly I think gamers are getting tired of the woke bs. just because you are friends with jeremy  doesnt mean you agree with everything he says but even if you do  as long as you aren t spreading hate you will be fine. you are incredibly attractive and sorry for comment on your looks but let s be real  most guy will think  ooo...hot chic  let s watch!  I have seen a couple of your videos and I like your personality and look forward to what your future videos
yup  libertarian myself
@melonie mac go boom  Im more libertarian than conservative too.  I just wish politicians would honor the bill of rights.  I prefer a smaller government that allows its citizens to make its own choices.  basically  if your actions aren t hurting others  you should be free to do what you want.
so wait.  hateforprofitexposed  goes around exposing themselves for hating for profit   what weirdos.
based
liking your content but there is a little to much extra commentary especially in the beginning of the videos. maybe time stamp where you actually start or when one rant begins and another stop. cant wait to watch more. maybe you were a twitch streamer before. kinda sound like your used to that type of content  where there is alot of things that are included because it cant chop out the dead air commentary. also your background and the camera angle is why I assume your a twitch creator initially. no offense
speak your truth.  it is a free country.  1st amendment for a reason...
I realy wish you werre the host on g4 instead of the blonde girl they put in there...
would love to see you get in touch with gothix and eric july   btw.. I have a confession.  im a male feminist.I have the audacity to believe men cannot be womenonly women can get pregnantmen  cannot menstruate men should not be in women s athletics and should not be able to break records in women s sports
its the woke left
pheet wen
your are very fit. why do you hate fat people.
skipped around... how you gonna play photographer enthusiast instead of just be direct and flirt  thats not hot  thats lame n creepy. but I just do app hookups and flings so what can I say.
everything woke turns to crap.
11 41 ok here s the thing. cancel culture is bad. but you absolutely should out your haters  and anyone who says anything.. anything that they should not have said. itshould be screenshotted and you should post it. nobody should go after them and try to cancel them or get them fired. itshould just be limited to them being outed for saying that. thats it. because now there s someone who said something to you that is really wrong  and youre protecting them. and they re not your friend. if they re are your friend then ok cool nevermind. coz if someone your friend you should never put them on blast even if they do say or do something stupid. you should always handle it in private. but if its a hater  especially if its someone who s known  people should know what they did. and on the flip side. anyone who messages anyone anything should fully 100  own what they said and if they re ashamed if it ever came out publicly then you shouldn t be writing that message.
build your own damn platformsstop working for and with the enemyproblem solved
tha gaming community is full of sjw s be happy to be rid of them.not that I like jeremy but I do not have to be friends with him so who cares.
just keep being yourself  commies gonna commie. they are irrelevant.
I would offer you my platform  but it is too small. try to contact tim pool  lauren chen  sydney watson. and put on some weight  you are gorgeous  but too  skinny. mad prompts.
communism sucks  thats what this kind of thing is.  its a struggle session  glad you no longer play the game.
some terrible misogynist told me and his other mindless followers to arrive and worship.we hear and obey.that out of the way.make content. be good.
