the main reason the  liberal media  didnt like the joker story was because itshowed how mental illness can make you a bad person.  in their world mental illness puts you high on the victim scale and so you are always a good person.that is literally the main and only reason they resented the movie.
the tone and themes in the first film were so beautifully dark and unnerving. I was captivated from start to finish  so Im very torn. in my opinion  the only way a musical works for the sequel is if it takes place in the mind  like you said. I dont see people running around singing and dancing in the streets of gotham  not in that universe. with that being said  they could do some very dark things with song-and-dance in the context of a warped and twisted psyche. I will say that lady gaga can actually act  so she has the potential to be a great harley quinn. Im not mad at all at that casting  but it will all come down to writing. its a wait and see for me.
what a better  joke  on the audience then to say that  joker 2  will be a musical.
joker 3 should be an asmr  art project   joker 4 should be an action comedy  joker 5 should be an animated comic book
but why  the 1st film was great. who the hell asked for a musical as a sequel
little shop of horror s  great musical from what I remember as a kid  I am interested in how this can work as well. actually I really think it can. lets face it  joker has some music in him  and itseems like a great way to explore his mind and emotions. and as a  romance  it makes sense as music always sounds better when  in love . plus I have some trust after 1st movie
I actually really like this idea. especially if they use the musical angle to show how he see s the world and juxtapose it with the grim reality of it all. however it all hinges on the execution
you know it actually could be pretty good like a pink floyd the wall type film  really dark inside the joker s lunatic mind  throw in some animated parts etc and heck yes why not  otherwise its just another sequel  thanks again
it doesnt need a sequel. oh well  let s see what happens.
joker was the last movie to shake me to the core.  entirely too relatable  minus actually falling into being homicidal and both killing and murdering people.I do not envy the filmmakers their task of bringing thatsame energy into the genre of musicals.
I love musicals. you should check out little shop of horrors. that one is gold. honestly if they have it be a musical with the perspective of someone else s psychosis  maybe harley s  I could see that working. that being said  I dont have faith in anything coming from hollywood  so I wont give this much thought until I hear reviews from people I trust
I really loved the first joker movie. I think this new one being a musical fits in with the character. I think the music scenes wont be reality. Im looking forward to it. on a side note  are you not doing comments and Bible verse from now on  or are you taking a break  I really enjoyed those segments.
the joker definitely had left right messaging  and blended the lines nicely which imo made it enjoyable! but lady gaga I fear is going to screw that balance up!
joker doesnt need a sequel. my hope s aren t high  but it can be done well.
I honestly preferred it as a one off it doesnt need a sequel
the joker 2 being a musical actually made me go   hm  this good be a good idea!   just imagine a joker movie that is literally just him  and presumably lady harley gaga quinn  running around singing about being crazy   this could be hilarious!switching topics  no reading comments on past videos or a verse of the day  noooooo....
mel I agree with everything you said in this video ! well said
you know she s distraught when she skips the  what is up my boomers!   intro. cant blame her  frankly.
I love musicals   les miserables  the sound of music  the greatest showman and many others but the first movie was excellent  I really dont want such a drastic change.
I didnt think about it like that  it could work that way! not that I would necessarily care for a musical either way  but that could at least work
absolutely.
and the fact that the main character is a hwite male...
uh  I did not like the joker movie because the joker needed no back story. what happened to the villain just being the villain

@evacody124  I disagree  I feel like any character can be given a good backstory  if written well and some writers are extremely talented. I feel like the joker movie can be enjoyed with your viewpoint if you just imagine it being its own timeline which is something only acceptable to us comic fans. only exception is yoda  cant outright finish the story-arc that the mandalorian is exploring with delving into more about yodas species  but you can flesh it out a bit.
joker 2  jokes on you.

no Bible verse of the day either... I hope thats not a trend!
@sergio leone  me too. perhaps this wasn t meant as an official episode  just as a quick one off video she shot while this was on her mind.
@sergio leone  mondays posting also had no Bible verse and she posted nothing at all on tuesday she stated last week her family in town this week but she also talked about stepping back from social media could be the backlash is too great for her to cope with
@walter petruszak  I hope she knows how much she means to us.
I thought this was an unconfirmed rumor at this point  either way  a musical is a huge miss for me. not like Ive even seen the first joker movie yet  but still.edit  so I just remembered the one musical Im down with  cannibal! the musical  1993 . absolutely hilarious film. from what I remember its also probably extremely offensive to the modern left. made by trey parker   matt stone  who Im sure dont need an intro.
you nailed it with the delusional thoughts from joker and quinn dancing   singing in their heads.
I could see a musical being popular across the board in this case. like how everyone likes the nightmare before Christmas.
good points you ve got there! thats why part 2 might be just a disaster...and about that  pray  reaction  where you ve said that you dont se any woke staff in it...just answer what exacly makes movie woke and you ll know why so many  smell woke  from a miles now  its somewhat a reflex reflux now     1. do lazy forced in representation - this can include flawless female minority  race swaps  gender swaps  sexuality swaps and more    2. focus on left wing messaging over story    3. lazy writing - reboot  prequel  sequel    4. poor bad writing - they just cant write coherent and interesting stories about interesting protagonist  because of an agenda that have to take prominent place    5. white male bad  and straight is the worst  devil almost  and stupid as a shoe!   6. who owns the platform distributor studio.I think those are the basics  what if any did Imissed    so thats why most of us see wokeism just spilling from every second of this trailer.and thats why it is better to not to make live reactions  because trailers are made to make some hype  even from crap  so its better to give it time to put up reasonable  not emotional opinion.
the ending too the original masterpiece happens inside a mental institution. maybe this whole musical number are basically what there treatment is doing too there minds. wrapping them into another reality.
mel was dead on right in this video!
honestly I can see it working dont forget he had a relationship all in his head in the first one so I can actually see him having these song and dance numbers in there as well
maybe its not as crazy at itsounds. I keep thinking about movie dancer in the dark with bjork. it was a  musical drama  and I could see joker story shown in this way.
joker 2. . . . could work as a musical . . .if they can do it right. part of me wants to see the jet lI fist of legend as a musical. sounds weird  err. . . maybe. though in londonthey re literally making every movie classic into a musical these days - back to the future is among the latest
it could be like  sweeney todd. I want to give joker 2 a chance become I love the first one. even though I dont like musicals other than the one I just  mentioned.
hey melonie I just want to tell you that I am sorry for having this very late but I just want to tell you that I have seen the joker movie and I never heard of this being a musical program and so I just want to say that I think that it will be okay for this being a musical program and I think that people will enjoy it and like it too as if it was a movie  ok melonie. anyway I just want to make a comment on this post of this video  ok melonie. anyway hope you have a wonderful   great blessed day today melonie   have a great week too with your pets melonie.
I get the reaction to the  musical  announcement  but author was dancing in a bunch of the first movie s scenes. if we see a bunch of musical skits from author s imagination while he is murdering people and doing other joker antics  that could be interesting. he sees them dancing while they re actually stumbling around chocking on joker gas. yikes!I think that would continue the twisted brutality of the first film just fine. and casting lady gaga seams more like a gag casting just meant to rile everyone up. its hilarious to see people praise the choice right now just because they assume they think the direction of the movie will offend fans of the first film. I personally dont think juaquin phoenix would be involved if he thought they were pandering to anyone. I could be wrong of course but I ll withhold judgment till we at least see a trailer.
I hope all is well mel. praying for you daily.
honestly I d watch it if they do harley right and I wouldn t care if it was a musical. also I recommend looking for staler   waldorf reacting to lady gaga  it explains her fans perfectly.
its for me.  Im excited to see this nightmare.
thats a great point  the musical portions could just be his imagination. that would make the movie being a musical a lot less off-putting. but still  I definitely would prefer if it was not a musical.
imagine having so little going on in your life that yourejoice in the disappointment in fans because they liked a movie you didn t like.
I always hated musicals.and then  I saw  anna and the apocalypse .
Im actually kind of excited about this. I can really see it working without jeopardizing the theme from the first movie. also  we already know joaquin can sing  so at least there s that. lady gaga is a weird choice  but I wouldn t have thought paris hilton would be a good casting for a very dark musical either  and she was absolutely incredible in repo! the genetic opera. so with thatsaid  Im cautiously optimistic about joker 2
because warner needs musicals disneyverse
do youreally believe a musical featuring lady gaga will have any chance to be  offensive to the left   your example is an exception.
@ redacted   misreading the room much  my added example of cannibal was me saying this is the only musical that I ever liked  not that this joker movie will follow in those footsteps. though I could see how someone might interpret it that way  the rest of the comment doesnt exactly support that interpretation.why do you think I included the  93 release date in the comment  hollywood studios whoever cant make content like they did back in the 80s 90s any more. there s a slim chance if the joker 2 musical rumor is true that it ll be offensive  especially with lady gaga. c mon dude. do better.
would rocky horror picture show count as a musical    cause thats on my short list of such movies I can watch repeatedly.  that and chicago .
@falcon_by_the_lake  absolutely counts as a musical  well both of them tbh. and I understand people s like of rhps but it just ain t for me. chicago is an even further stretch. like I said  cannibal is pretty much the only one I could even sit through much less enjoy.
@cd5sircoupe  I ll have to find cannibal  then.  sounds like its... messy fun.
@falcon_by_the_lake  you probably wont regret it if you can deal with some offensive humor.I dont remember it being as bad as itsounds on paper  but I could be wrong. its been about 20 years since Ive seen it.
the south park movie is also a great musical.
thank you so much  it means a lot
hey! team boomer got you fam!
you are being spammed  you should warn your viewers because  you cant fix stupid
sweeney todd was excellent
I know a lot of men who love musicals but dont like to be open about it. my dad is one of them
I was thinking about this.  george lucas said that american graffitI was a musical.  it did have music constant in the background.  format the majority of joker 2 in the same manner.  have three original songs  one sung by joaquin phoenix  one sung by lady gaga  and then a duet with them both.  might be crazy enough to work.  wait where was the verse of the day
I really hope  musical  is some sort of a metaphor
its certainly a risky approach  but I think any sort of  conventional  sequel to joker would be a guaranteed failure. there was a story  and they told it  so to undo the conclusion or shoehorn in more of the same would not only be terrible but it would also diminish the original.best guess is some sort of insane delusional world  bright colours and happy songs  because joker and harley really do love each other and that presumably does give them genuine joy... and that contrasts well against the dark reality of the world around them and the things they re doing in reality.
to be honest I wonder if the musical bits will be in his head since the last time we saw author he was locked up so what if this is going on in his head
well.....so much for hoping for an  awesome sequel . guess we jinxed ourselves there!
Imean if its a sweeney todd style musical movie Im all for it. and if joker 2 is about him finding his love in harley quinn after the loneliness and despair of the first movie its a perfect fit. I trust dc to keep their franchise dark and interesting and not fall for the wokeism doctrine  that is now on its way out anyway. gen z is hella bored by wokeism  continuing it beyond millenials would be idiotic.
wait  this is real !
I do remeber them calling the joker like a  incel fantasy . basically they hate it when their side doesnt get the movie  I seriously dont think it was intended for either political side  it was more about mental health.
musicals aren t that bad
mealonie  youre so beautiful as always  lmao @ a joker musical movie    I think it would be awesome  gaga is very talented and as beautiful as you!! did you see her live in las vegas for her acoustic show  jazz and piano
if you ever watched modern family tv show or any other movie or show with gay characters they are stereotyped to loving musicals  so itseems hollywood is repackaging a character like the joker they hated into a more woke friendly version in a format of a musical seems really risky trying to get a new demographic to watch with good chance turning off its core audience
it could work  if they lean into their madness
never watched the joker but I do like the joker as a character. what I dont see is why they would make the 2nd movie a musical if the 1st movie wasn t. Im a fan of musicals too but it doesnt really make sense to me.
I love musicals lmao Im so down for this
I think musical numbers will probably represent his insanity.
this is I think the second go boom vid w out viewer comments questions segments and scripture of the day. are you intentionally dropping those segments of your vids  if so I hope its because its what you want to do as a creator and not as a response to negative nancys and haters exhausting your energy for personal well being.if the latter  hope Im not contributing to the negativity burden.
there is absolutely no way I would watch the joker musical.
joker is an art house film in the guise of a mainstream film. joker is identical to the movie black swan. both charecters are the same  both performers  both live with their mothers  both turn into evil version of the performance charecter  both have imagined romantic relationships. natalie portman even won an oscar as well  thats how similiar they are. because of the way the movie was made  a sequal would never work because it would clash too much to the original film. there needed to be an angle to make the movie work  a musical is the perfect way to create that edge it needs. on the surface itsounds dumb and woke  but its not  there are dark disturbing musicals  phantom of the opera  little shop of horrors  and specifically  sweeney todd  the demon barber of fleet street . I was thinking about it last night when I heard about it. this is exactly what it needs because joker was always an introspective movie about exploring charecter and the external story that we see unfold is charector development  not a typical story thats unfolding where there is a charecter involved. imagine a dark gorey style like sweeny todd but its also a love story between joker and harley. this actually has the potential to completely outshine the first movie  the potential for it is that high. no other sequal would work  the first movie would have to stand alone. the good news is that its taken this long for them to confirm a sequal which means they wouldn t have done this if they weren t sure there was meat to the project. in other words  its not a one dimensional cash grab.
I do not want a joker musical omg  dammmm melonie noooooooooooooo
yep.
seems intentional because of how well the first one did to be blunt.
when we hear about mega-million dollar projects coming from these massive studios you d think tons of market research would be involved  data  analytics  and overall tons of due diligence. but nope. none of that happens. not even a little bit. it all comes down to the flippant decisions of a few key people who think their decisions should outweigh quality research.
6 00 I think the word you are hunting for is maniacal.
just to play devil s advocate  everyone thought a movie with just joker with no batman was a bad idea when it was first announced. the first image of joaquin phoenix in joker makeup was panned too. the only time people started getting on board with that movie was when the trailer dropped. then everyone was praising itsaying they d see it day one. so ya know what  wait for a trailer and then judge it.
repo man  the genetic opera pulled it off  maaaybe thats what they re aiming for
regardless if joker 2 is actually a musical  joker doesnt need a sequel. its fine the way it is. told its story in one film and I didn t leave the theater or anytime Ive finished watching it on blu-ray with a need to see more of this universe. since joker made over a billion dollars  there s a financial reason for a sequel to be made.
I guess it depends on how much of a musical it actually is for me. if they are going to do the musical parts for what s going on in his head  instead of doing the whole fake relationship thing like in the first movie. it could work to bring more of that joker side out. btw  I like these shorter format videos. they will work out better in the long run. maybe you can read comments and do Bible verses as a second video at the end of each week  that way we can get the best on both worlds.
is this the real life or is this fantasy caught in a landslide or escape from reality
I dont know  if its done well this could be really great. though  if its anything short of great  it will be truly terrible.
I thought lady gaga fans were those who have a fetish for her ice cream. . . . .  no  Im not making that part up - the ice cream part. . .
hollyweird makes most movies for hollyweird! plus if it ain t broke  break it!
do we know its a full-fledged musical  all Ive seen are sources saying it. I haven t seen todd phillips say it. everything is going to be exaggerated and sensationalized through the prism of media outlets. it could be that there are a few musical numbers that take place in joker s mind  especially involving harleen   and that replace the talk-show fantasies in the first film  with the rest of the movie being straight. I think we should try to avoid jumping the gun. this isn t someone new. these are the same people that gave us the 2019 film  so let s give them the benefit of the doubt until they forfeit it. but I ll be going in with my arms crossed if its confirmed to be a full-fledged gene kelly movie.
please let this be real ! please please please ! I hope they spend 200 million making this movie.  no thats not enough I want them to spend 500 million to make this movie.ps theres no chance I would ever watch a musical... 0
Im not watching it. the first movie was brilliant. one of very few movies I can say is damned near perfect as a film  and itshouldn t be as good as it is.the second one shouldn t even get made  let alone be a musical. this sounds like a  we hate the fans  so let s ruin another thing the fans like  thing.
they re trying to corrupt the social impact of the joker.
no verse of the day  is that being taken out of the format  sad if it is. it was a highlight. have a great day!  thanks for the videos.
what she was saying about musical in the head  but dark trip in reality sounds like meet the pyro for team fortress 2. I would actually be interested if thats what the movie ends up being.
this joker was one of my favs till I heard this news awhile back plus with having lady gaga..... I hope none of this is real cuz joker 2 could have been badass.
sweeney todd was pretty good but not rewatch able.
I thought joker was supposed to be a one off.
I think you are too serious. personally  I find this hilarious. what better way to be demented than by having a juxtaposition between a crazy joker story and a musical. your final take to me seems spot on to what they would do. with harley quinn it ll be a love story so this is perfect. ready for the troll when this comes out!
Ive thought that the musical aspect would have to be delusions as well. it really is the only thing that would make sense from a narrative perspective. but who in their right mind would think the audience that made joker a success would want to watch a musical  maybe in a movie designed to be funny like a deadpool  but not one as serious as the joker. on another note  I did appreciate the verse of the day in previous videos. Im not sure if you have decided to stop including them  but they were appreciated by many of us I think.
lovely vid!
on the joker musical  I agree with your original assessment about the joaquin phoenix joker. mainstream media didn t like it. I think its because it was a pro-positive mental health piece in a time when they re trying to ramp up everyone s craziness. they cant condone something that might encourage empathy. joker 2 being a musical seems like it might end up as like a rip off from the mask with jim carey. I hope not  though. we ll see. I like jokers that are good opponents for batman to take on. thats the whole point. right
the first one was good and I am in that torn camp cause.... part of me goes please no and the other part of me is going ehhh could be fun. lady gaga as harley that could be an interesting choice and after ledger and pattison who didn t do that bad. I say lets see what they got. I would want to see more for it though before judgement.
Imean joker is an entertainer in his own mind   in the comics  games   animated shows he has some musical numbers.  I dont mind it at all   it keeps in character  and lady gaga from what Ive heard is a pretty amazing actress so Im curious how she will do in the moviehere are jokers musical numbers through the years https   youtu.be akvixxod9oi
if its truly a musical  I wont be seeing it. first movie was perfect and doesnt need a sequel anyway
what if the joker throws a gas bomb that forces people to burst into song why doing anarchy stuff
I like a couple musicals. 7 brides for 7 brothers was good  as was oklahoma!.I always enjoyed popeye even. I cant see making a joker movie one  tho. huh
well the joker is mentally disturbed so maybe some scenes have musical parts highly doubt the whole movie is gonna be a musical.
I feel like this is someone s already existing project they are going to wrap the joker theme around like a soup can label because the first film did well. this is just weird.
this isn t the joker  this is a joker same as the movie was.  hard pass on all of it.
no verse of the day
there have only been three people that have played joker that did a great job.the joker movie was not needed. you dont need to know the back story of the joker.
I really liked joker but generally dislike musicals. I ll have to wait and see what they do with this because Im still interested but these days movies gotta earn my money and not rely on brand loyalty.
is harley gonna be like a freak that murders people and sings in joy at the same time  cuz that could be really creepy . is that what they are going for   I am confused.
I think a sequel movie is a bad idea however the idea of a musical has me quite intrigued. Im pretty over comic book shit at this point but this is a new spin on the genre.
going to austin for comic con
joker  makes a billion dollars.  wb   man  I hate making money  how about we make the sequel a musical.
yup. stupidest thing possible  if true .
gaga is an amazing musical talent and she has a really weird personality and in her words  feels different  so I think she s the perfect person to make music for such a movie    did you see her live acoustic show in las vegas  jazz and piano    if not you missed out! it was amazing!
I dunno  I thought sweeny todd was a good example. did you dig that one  I did    or like  that movie a knight s tale  another example.
@neutrino78x  I honestly didn t watch sweeny todd. Im not a musical fan  but I think it could be done if it was meant to be 4th wall breaking and amusing. Im thinking like a doctor horrible type of thing  which is honestly the only time I wanted to watch a musical
guess you didn t see sweeney todd the musical.
@dcmastermind first  I saw the movie version.  it is great!  my problem is this batman character with no batman nonsense.. its lame.
@fl3tch_a_sk3tch  it doesnt need batman. there s lots of joker stories without him.
seems like a scam......
a musical could be interesting. I love dark musicals like sweeney todd  rocky horror  and little shop of horrors.
Imean  we ve dunked on dc entertainment choices before. like when robert pattinson was becoming batman and no one thought he could pull it off. but...then again  they haven t made amazing decisions as of late. guess we ll see.
thanks melonie for covering this topic once I read they are having joker 2 amusical.idk about it I loved the jokerI have to see the trailer to it. but the 1stjoker was a fantastic movie seeing how the joker was formed into.I believethe so called sequel joker 2 doesnt mesh with everything what the joker is.again Im going to have to see the darntrailer to joker 2.sweeney tod was amusical was interesting well done movie. again thanks melonie for covering this.takecare melonie
making it a musical is dumb. that being said  lady gaga s  weirdness  is all an act put on for her fans  as she herself has attested to in one of her interviews. ergo it is blatantly obvious she is very capable of acting  that paired with just how weird some of the things she has done have been  I d be willing to give her a shot at a rendition of harley quinn.
to be fair  I kinda wanna commitsome crime now    lol I hate musicals...
honestly I think lady gaga would do very well as harley quinn because she s already insane in real life.
the first film was  mostly  about classism. how the rich will  try to  obfuscate and  drug  the poor into submission. thats my opinion as a straight  white and full of  toxic  masculinity conservative male. Im not sure what the other side of the aisle saw. never paid too much attention to it.as far as the future  nobody s made a  the joker  musical. that will definitely be a first. other than that  I like to keep an open mind. I hope their project is just as good and deep as their first film. or better.
all true your saying melonie
I ll admit I dont like this musical idea either  but I ll give it a chance and there have been darker musicals that worked such as little shop of horrors and west side story among others...now again not for this joker is arguably the darkest character in comics or one of easily  musical you think what  Im all behind lady gaga being harley though that Im curious about  but I am not sure who thought a musical would be a great idea. it can work but Im worried...as for her fans being woke  liberal sadly this applies to most actors so no escaping that  but she can act and perform well so Im curious to see her version of harley.
Im asian and I like the joker
ergh a joker 2 musical is a laughing stock . nobody asked for this. the first film was good the way they did it. I like how they d displayed his insanity as the film progressed. joker was a complete masterpiece   love it
I am the the exact demographic everyone hates. I loved joker I have watched this movie at least 10 times since it came out and Im excited for it being a musical. joker is always dancing through out the entire first movie . I think joker 2 will probably be a deeper dive in to his mind and he loves music . he loves  show tune  kind of music remember the scene where he is watching the minstrel show and shoots the wall. or when hes dancing down the steps. or when he dances in the bathroom after the subway killings. jokers a dancing machine. I imagine the whole movie to have that kind of retro kind of music . I bet harley isn t even really crazy in this movie. joker probably imagines his doctor as his partner in crime and its all in his head .
they want that west side story money...
its not. the idea they will run with has been done many times before. basically you will get moments where we see the world through joker s eyes. in his world  things are different  like the relationship that never happened in 1st film. this will no doubt happen when he is around harley...the whole falling in love. it might also happen from her side  a good example of what I think they will do can be found in the fisher king. https   www.youtube.com watch v lasprnwf6ca t 56s
the idea is to ruin it because of the based nature of the first movie.
the writing for the first joker movie was almost identical to writing in the film  taxI driver  from the 70s.  this new abomination perfectly highlights the lack of creativity buzzing around in the empty void between the ears of hollywood writers. hollywood is a bit of a ..  joke  at this point.
joker was a phenomenal movie. one that would ve been great even without the dc branding. Im praying that this whole musical announcement really is a sick joke.
well. how many times was star trek 4 announced by now  and the movie still isn t even in preproduction. I ll believe these musical news  when I see the first trailer to that...musical.
I know Im not supposed to question the glory of joker... but was anybody else bothered that joker was neither intelligent nor funny  I watched it in theaters  enjoyed it  and never thought about it again.

well the movie was bad lol
dumpster fire
@dean firnatine  down to how they use it and how often.
ya man  I didn t like joker either.   seen better joker stories in my life  and this joker was pretty boring.
I never saw the first one. nothing about the joker ever interested me  let alone how he became a monster. he was just a silly foil for batman and nothing more.
I cant help but feel this is the moment when I press  x  to doubt. that aside  I am not entirely opposed to the concept of it being a musical  or having musical sequences  provided that the overall film retains the atmosphere of the original.
it could be good
the demographics for transformers was 92  male. that is overwhelmingly male. Im surprised its not more for joker considering how  the news media  cried about the film. saying its overwhelmingly male in some meaningful way is just blatantly dishonest. just more nonsensical outrage.
I have no idea what to think on this one! haha
glad I never saw the first one I guess... too bad  I heard nothing but good about the first one. planned on seeing itsomeday  not anymore.
commenting to bring back the verse of the day
sweeney todd imho worked because tim burton used the musical parts to make the listener even more uneasy. deliberately weird timing  at points where no other musical piece would ve made the characters start singing. completely horrible topics and evil lyrics. if they make that happen for joker 2 that would be awesome.
lady guy guy isn t an actress
its for lady gaga--joker faceimagine the bodyguard meets don quixote with harley quinn being the reluctant female lead and the joker as the male lead and unreliable narrator.
when I heard this was a musical this morning I thought this was a joke. when the trailer comes out we will have to see.
I just got hated on lady gaga s post on insta for having an opinion.
doesnt look like my kinda movie

no verse of the day or comments
but why
hay  buffy to vampire slayer had a musical and I for one liked it. but I probably will not go to see this.
oh no.
seems more like a spin off.
lady gaga was pretty good in american horror story
wich is the compleet difference with the joker movie. no super heroes just a reflection on society. maybe watch it before commenting.  no hate  but it is just verry different.
lady gay-gay  there  I fixed it for you was a-ok in american horror story.

insert ryan reynold face meme but why
I seen the joker and I didn t think it was terrible but Im not conservative and Im also not liberal so I dont know where those people got the idea that the only people who liked it were conservatives.. I probably wont see the sequel but only time will tell
I cant help feeling like this is a joke drummed up by dc marketing to generate buzz. if not  how can it not flop
what a great first movie I hate musicals so .... this sounds bad
this could work I think
did you get shadow banned  wheres the views
73 26
typical dc  they release something good and then go f ck it up right after
I just dont want a sequel full stop. musical or not
musical    fire whoever even suggested this!!
I trust todd philips to make it right.
joker musical would be great for his psychosis.
looks like another popular ip being taken over in order to push the  message . also  it could have to do with the little dance number in the stairs where a lot of clout chasing influencers cosplayed and reenacted. these could be the people they are catering to.
only musical  like johnny deep movie and willy wonka and wiz of oz
this one sounds like a big nope for me.
ill get to you later meet the feebles could be considered a musical.  so disturbing imagery has been done with music has been before!
why not  hollywood has already ruined everything else.there s only been 2 decent musicals.the little shop of horrors.rocky horror picture show.
no usual intro  melonie is not joking around in this vid. still no Bible verse...
it was the only way to get gays interested in the movie
I didn t even watch the first one.
joke 2 will suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck oh snap
wait a second thats two videos without a Bible verse is everything all right miss the Bible verse stay safe God bless
I dont mind an original idea. lets judge when there is something too judge.ofc I like musicals   straight male   so thats why I dont feel bias  about it.
Im not here for a stupid musical  did not like the joker movie because it was not a joker movie  it was tom phillips honoring his hero martin scorsese who hates comic book movies  with the name of a popular comic book character   and using  the taxI driver and the king of comedy both martin scorsese movies  cut and paste that is the only reason  robert dinero is even in the movie    notice how scorsese didn t have any problems with this comic book movie
I remember seeing sweeny todd with johnny depp. that was a stealth musical. I hate musicals they are so boring in a movie. have they learned nothing from cats
I hate musicals
that ll be ass  I hate musicals.
im guessing the director wanted to be in the woke cult in hollywood so he bent the knee and is making this sequel to make them happy I guess. rip
I never like  musical most of the time
because its success has to be undermined at all costs. the original was liked by too many thought criminals so it has be infiltrated and eaten from the inside.
I wont be seeing joker 2 lol.  musical is fine but makes no sense with how the original was.  if they casted a different joker and wanted to do a musical Im all for it but being a direct sequel to joakims the joker makes no sense
youre being trolled.
well  I am not interested. way to ruin a good series they turning it into a musical.
I dont like musicals and I hate that the sequel is a musical. nobody wants this to be a musical. lady gaga could be a good harley quinn though. honestly  I feel that a sequel is not needed and that it would have been better as a one-off.
be careful with the  demon possessed  comment.  defamation and all  you know
liberal social media hated the joker  what lol you just be making things up
since when are liberals left wing cmon melonie... youre deflecting here. like Jesus Christ I get that youre trying to fish for right wing guys who find you nice to look at but its so transparent.
the 1st so called  joker  movie sucked anyways.   joker lacked comedic timing and pizzazz.  Imean  joker laughs because he s a maniac that finds everything funny and thinks everything is a joke.  not because its some sort of mental disorder.   also the freaking dot on his nose drove me crazy.
from what I understand there could have been multiple jokers in the comic universe. so the joker you describe is likely a different person altogether and then arthur.
@liberty jones  I think for me anyways  Ive watched and read so many joker stories in my life  that the joker movie just felt boring.
@vooodu vooodu  it was high art of the film world and not some low iq cape crap movie. Im sure a lot of people didn t get it. not enough special effects or space lasers I guess. just forget its based off a comic book for a minute and re adjust. honestly one of the best films in the last decade.
@liberty jones  I did  get it  .  not my fault is was boring garbage. also not my fault Ive seen better joker stories in comics  animation  movies and video games.. it has nothing to do with space lasers and special effects..   should have just called it clown and removed all ties from the  batman universe.
