growing up my favorite films starred jackie chan  bruce lee  jet lI and donnie yen. only now do I realize that I never truly enjoyed them because  not being chinese like jackie  bruce  jet or donnie I never saw myself on screen! how foolish I was to spend countless hours watching kung fu flicks and loving them all.
the shadow that bred them can only mock  it cannot make  not real things of its own.  - j.r.r. tolkien
came here from the quartering s recommendation. sub d because youre cute  not woke  are intelligent  and an all around  good egg  as jeremy said. you go melonie.  istandwithginacarano
its like when youre a kid and you see the lotr movies on the shelf  and you ask your mum  please can we buy Lord of the rings  and your mum says  we have Lord of the rings at home  - and its this
as someone who has been building a world and crafting a story for five plus years  I cant help but pay attention to the absolute destruction of lotr. created by a man with so much passion and love  its disheartening to see it nuked from orbit by writers and producers without an ounce of care in their souls for a property that does not belong to them. this is different from star wars or star trek  whose demise was laid down by cowards and parasites. but when it comes to the works of j.r.r. tolkien  this hits differently. we re effectively seeing what amounts to as vandalism on classical literature. shame on the writers for doing this  if they had any weight of dignity and respect as writers  they would know better. instead they prostitute tolkien s printed words and accuse fans of being whatever new word that was given to them by their Lord and masters of cultural molestation.
I never get tired of these videos  melonie! as for the new lotr  itseems more like a statement to amazon s spending power than trying to pay respects for tolkien. you can practically hear bezos screaming   this cost me a billion dollarrrrrrs!
been a fan since day 1 of this channel. thank you for putting yourself out there to talk about these issues and putting voice to those opinions of our fan communities that would otherwise go ignored.one  single  30-something  irish american-indian  to another  happy valentine s day to you. keep doing what youre doing  girl  it makes a difference.
evil is not capable of creating anything new  it can only distort and destroy what has been invented or made by the forces of good.    j.r.r. tolkien
love to see another female libertarian! love your faith  and Ive never been more thankful for following jeremy s suggestion to pop over here    you keep doing you - Im here for it!
congratulations. keep the channel growing! the lotr show looks like a bad syfy movie with a higher budget.
the shadow that bred them can only mock  it cannot make  not real new things of its own. I dont think it gave life to the orcs  it only ruined them and twisted them. -j.r.r tolkien
we re gonna watch the trailer! we didn t miss much  did we female inclusivity is like saying a woman cant enjoy shawshank redemption.... an all-male cast! grow up lefties!
melonie mac go boom. got bigger on just one week  awesome. congratulations  also happy valentine s day at least. thanks for this video on this day. lol lotr amazon dumpster fire is glorious
I was lucky enough to see each movie of the lotr trilogy on opening night.  I ll never forget watching return of the king. when eowyn uttered that line  the entire freaking theater erupted in cheers. my wife among them  whose wedding dress was based after galadriel s btw .  those were strong women. beautiful  cunning  brave and feminine. we absolutely need to embrace that again.
the fact that there is zero dialogue source material for them to base this on is a huge problem.
congratulations mel. you are awesome.    the same cannot be said for this trailer... and most likely the show
this has quickly become one of my favorite channels. also  single on valentine s day isn t a bad thing.
I originally read the books years ago  a couple of years back I decided to listen to the audio books while driving to work. I never realized these books are musicals. I skimmed through all the singing when I read it myself  but where you are listening to someone else reading it is put in your face. someone needs to do a video that is an abridgement of just the songs  it would be epic.
I too found you from the quartering. dude you have such an infectious laugh. keep it up
I know Im late to the comment party but still  youre bringing that legit breath of fresh air yt doesnt know its been needing!! hope more like you stand up and cause a wind of change  pure unfiltered opinions that just make sense against the noise if youre asking me  another 30-something someone glad there s awesome channels like yours left     and I know how compliments get misread all the time nowadays but thats just what it is  respect for maintaining that fitness!
Im so glad I hunted down physical copies of the extended editions of lotr recently for my dvd collection.streaming services are a scourge on classic culture. as we ve seen from disney  where they labeled old animated films like dumbo  aristocats and peter pan as  problematic . they start by adding trigger warnings  but it wont be long until these streaming services start putting older productions into the memory hole due to their  offensive content . or for simply trying to retcon stuff out of a franchise they bought or has control over  like george lucas did when he made edits to the original star wars films so I guess you could say that modern day politics have really gotten me into finding and buying physical copies of a lot of films and tv-series so I can both preserve childhood memories and preserve it all for the future.
@seven proxies  I had the special edition with the doc when power corrupts great times
totally. rings of power   white bread home burger
they already destroyed it with I think the 2nd movie  though far less blatantly.for example  in the movie the elf queen s water was used as a cauldron and she was called a witch  whereas in the book  that water was strongly implied to be the Bible and her like a mature Christian giving something like prophetic advice as a woman of the God of Gods.
@independent aquaman  thats your own head canon
lol Im sorry but the post was way too funny man. its a fantasy world chill bro its not thatserious.
@mickey mickey  no  read the old version of the book at that location and compare to thatsection of the movie.
@jose denis  it is thatserious because tolkien intentionally wrote it to imply something else  just like writer of chronicles of narnia.
@independent aquaman  no  thats your head canon fan theory. tolkein explicity stated he wanted middle earth to be the iliad  odyssey  and aenid of the british people. while lewis explicity stated narnia was a Christian allegory. middle earth is explicitly designed to be mythological.
@mickey mickey  ummm  but in that mythology tolkien was referring to Christian symbols  not wiccan.
@independent aquaman  it was neither. the elves are inspired by norse and celtic mythology.
@independent aquaman  no it isn t. its just consumer media. dont like it  dont watch it or support it. its thatsimple. if you dont like the vision that company or director had  go out and make your own. write your own script and shop it around. complaining in youtube comments isn t really going to solve anything.
@jose denis  do you have any idea the amount of work and effort tolkien dedicated to middle earth and the depth to which he went with it
@skaruts  thats not an argument...
@jose denis  I beg to differ. the man s achievements are humbling  unmatched and deserving of respect. its only understandable that anyone that butchers it arrogantly  gets to contend with the people who actually appreciate the value of his work.
@skaruts  that doesnt really respond to anything I said. I literally just said its not thatserious. which its not. its a tv show  about a fantasy world  being distributed by a multi-billion dollar corp. quit giving it this biblical reverence as if its life or death. its super sad.
@skaruts  youre literally just the wrestling fan meme crying  its still real to me dammit!  like seriously grow up. touch some grass.
I completely agree  they ruined the hobbit.
reminds me of bon jour diamond jim   I paid a billion dollars for that piece of shit
the Lord of ..... westeros ! like tf is this shit  not that Im a big fan of lotr  quite the contrary  if you are confused 15 min into the movie and stay that for the next 10 hours  its not a good movie  period.  but this is looking like some strange  wannabe got with diversity shit . not some tolkien fantasy stuff.
your comment on shawshank redemption is powerful in its pithiness! nicely written
melo be go bigger like..boom boom boom lol
yes!!!!
wheel of time has complete source material but amazon amd rafe judkins butchered it. yep  this show would face a bigger problem.
@mark  Im glad I never tried thatshow. I read the wheel of time like 20 years ago  and it became a favorite of mine. I knew the show would be a disaster.
if you enjoyed the singing  you might enjoy the legend of sigurd   gudr n. there s a ton of singing in it. I only have the book  and so Ive never read it because of that. I skipped all the singing in lotr too.
this is amazing. I have always said that it is best to stick to the source material. trying to appease the  woke  crowd will only get you so far  it is the fans you want to cater to. doesnt make sense to make changes like this  a waste of a billion dollars. I like your take on a lot of stuff and your explanations are very fair in my opinion. not hating just to hate but actual reasons. it is getting ridiculous! cant believe youre single  right there with you! lol
I still occasionally watch the rohirrim come in the last minute to help gondor. love thatscene!
got a kick out of the lotr comment section plus a couple of comments regarding your inclusion of faith in your videos - laughed out loud on the wheelbarrow one!  happy valentines day to all.
one person pointed out sometime ago that a great area the show could ve focused on was the blue wizard s fights in the east that helped weaken sauron s rule. considering we know next to nothing about the blue wizards and their efforts in the east  it would ve been the perfect opportunity for amazon to expand upon this and also easily make it diverse as we dont know a crap ton about the east.
excellent vod  mel! since I was a small child  the Lord of the rings movies have been my movies  and the hobbit and the Lord of the rings books have been my fav books  so what they are doing to tolkien s work is pissing me right the hell off  like  you literally have no idea just how mad I am. I want to turn into the hulk right now and destroy them! lol.
this is why  as a creative person  I feel this huge sense of responsibility these days. I gotta put something out there that counters this stuff in some way.
I dont have a problem with them coming up with some reason why there might be black dwarves or black elves.  like if the sylvan elf came from some elven enclave in a region like harad or umbar or even beyond rhun  that d be fine. what really bothers me is the fact that they are perverting characters that are well established and documented -warrior galadriel and peaceful hippy elrond.
evil cannot create anything new  they can only corrupt and ruin what good forces have invented or made.   -  j . r.  r.  tolkien
I just cant believe youre single on val s day  mel! all I ll say is we re similar in age  so I feel I can relate  and God will take care of you. Im a new subscriber  found you via the steam you did with the drinker   but I cantell youre passionate  beautiful and committed  all of which make for an a amazing companion. keep doing all you do in charity!
I forgot it was valentine s day until I turned the tv on this morning.  I was still  in the midst of navigating the emotions I felt after watching a great super bowl game  needless numbers of crypto commercials and this trailer.  now Im going to eat a piece of dark chocolate and drink some mountain dew.  I was very underwhelmed by the trailer.  Im still reserving a shred of hope  since this is only a teaser...I think I fears will be confirmed when a real trailer comes out.  but whether I watch it or not  amazon has paid for 5 seasons and committed financially  so whatever.  good verse for today - and every day.  esv is my go to translation.btw  I read nancy drew books when I was a kid  and hardy boys  because they were good stories.  I liked the character because she was good  spunky  and bucked the system as much as a kid could  quite often  to do what was right.ok  to answer your questions -- the dudes with the moose antlers are supposed to be harfoots  or proto hobbits.  there s no  shire   but there is a multicultural tribe of pre-hobbits that Im sure we ll get an explanation as to why there s no trace of them anywhere in the lore.  the narrative voice at the beginning is supposedly that girl with the acorns in her hair  whose character name is elanor  norI  brandyfoot.  I just got a narnia feel instead from that whole section.-the naked dude in the fire is only known right now as  the stranger  played by daniel weyman.  strongest rumor is he may be one of the blue wizards  who were one of gandalf s teammates that came a little earlier than he did  but they went into the east and weren t heard from again.  some people said sauron  but thats a reach.-the girl on the cliff doing the lara croft move is galadriel.
whoever it is that is playing elrond in this show is in for a rough time simply because hugo weaving is such a boss.
I love everything about this woman!!! its like she s reading my mind
feliz d a del amor y la amistad  melanie  espero que te la pases bien soy tu fan
its sad countries like south korea  and japan make more entertaining shows  music  and games that aren t woke.  this should ve been a sure fire hit but personal agendas messed it up of course. love your personality and videos youre awesome.
that comment from johnathan is pretty much something eric july says all the time about dc   marvel. love these reaction videos.
when people watch something thats european they want it to be european authentic. its not racism its authenticity. when you watch a mobster movie those actors portray italian gangsters  same difference. their little  you cant handle black elves  argument is tedious at best.
youre an excellent communicator  melonie.
I like this melonie! great channel  thanks for coming out of the sheep herd lady. please do a feature on the book of bobba fett.
got sent here from the quartering.probably adding this to my daily watch.and not just because melonie is easy on the eyes. lol. she s also got really smart takes too.
Im expecting this to be more woke trash! but  it is lotr so I ll give it a watch  with my puke bucket at my side just in case! happy valentines day melonie and to all other single people out there! this day is the worst
wait why is thatsad  and wtf thats not even true  squid game was straightup a criticism of hyper-capitalism thats promoted by the west. how is that not woke  xd
@jose denis  I really dont care. thats my opinion. there s more korean shows than just squid game you know.
@antbaze97  whaaaat ! youre kidding! I thought squid game was the only piece of media south korea has ever made!
happy valentine s day  young lady. congratulations on the growth of your channel.
we all should do a lotr marathon on sept 2.
they want to prevent people from relating to anyone who isn t a one-to-one reflection of the viewer s identity because it keeps people divided. if you cant relate to fictional characters beyond superficial identity  you are training your brain to think that way in real relationships. this line of thinking will breed a culture with no empathy for differences.
I was wondering why those 2 guys decided to kill a moose each and then wear it ! not my idea of an accessory
totally feel you when you say its insulting for them to say now you can enjoy it because we changed this.
the visuals look pretty awesome  I will totally watch it for free online
back when ronald d moore gender-swapped starbuck for battlestar galactica  he did not attack the fans. if I remember correctly  all he said was  we know the fans are concerned  but just watch and give katie sackoff a chance  we think you ll like it.
a new legend begins yes  it is in fact so new that tolkien s litterature had nothing to do with it
dont stare at her abs... dont stare at her abs... dont stare at her abs... dont stare at her abs...oh  I stared at her abs  what s this video about again
oh yes remember that part in the books when galadriel free climbed a glacier with a dagger while wearing full armor  Im surprised she didn t have a go pro on her head.
it really is visually a beautiful trailer. sadly  I think thats all this has going for it.
5 57 I was laughing my ass off at that part  it was good and funny at the sime time
but in the end  its only a passing thing  this shadow. even darkness must pass. a new day will come. and when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer. -samwise gamgee   the two towers.
the video was gold  but the verse of the day was the cherry on top - such an encouragement. God bless!
actually just thought of a spoof video that could be made that would be hilarious. like you can have all the dwarves from the hobbit trilogy all standing around working and then in walks a black dwarf everybody stops working nobody says anything their eyes get 50-cent piece sized and they re all locked on the new black dwarf as he s walking through the work area  black dwarf notices that he stops and looks around at everybody staring at him he  shrugs his shoulders and says ma- representation yo then keeps walking. I think people making spoof videos like that is the only entertainment that we re going to get from this new series
agree and surprisingly make excellent points. definitely best good.  .one best scene ever enyown defeating witchking. I know and fear that people will just try to destroy all j.r.r. work  just feel happy . best to you. and alone on valentine day too  but happy valentine day too
I honestly couldn t care less what color an actor actress is. what makes me care is when I know they didn t choose the best actor actress for the role and chose them specifically to win the oppression olympics. they dont seem to understand they are generating a luxury product  if I see them stuffing garbage into a fancy package  Im not going to buy it  and I can live quite comfortably without doing so.until the time the entertainment industry starts giving a shit about the product they are putting out Im going to be saving a lot of money on entertainment.  or become a weeb lol
you go girl!  3
the trailer on the amazon channel is currently sitting at 16k likes to 25k dislikes.
amazon  let s spend a half a billion creating another world. melonie  is he naked !  haha!  he s naked! I think amazon could have saved a lot of money entertaining melonie.
tell us if you want your money back afterwards!
@peter h  hahaha deal
true
read into the similarion and books because the movies are great but the books are miles better. the movies bastardized the hobbits except sam I could go on about my issues with it but I absolutely still love them and the only reason eowyn was able to kill the witch king was because of merry stabbing him with blade he possessed because the blade was made specifically to fight against the witch king thus killing his power essentially. also I appreciate you for sharing your faith. its hard for me to share my faith around my friends because they are not Christians and I feel like they will have a  knee jerk reaction to me talking about it. I also am trying to get my faith back and in fellowship with the Lord because I got a little girl to worry about it. so we may not agree on everything but I appreciate you with your faith mel
being single for valentine s day is not bad at all  just means the right one is still looking for you. happy valentine s day  please be mine lol
thats true about the witch king fight. Ive never heard anyone criticize it as lame or  girly .
holy hell! I was the same way about iron boy jr and Im the odd man out with my friends and family!
im irish and native americanto!! this show breaks my heart already
single on any holiday is rough. valentine s day stings a bit more itseems. great video . this show is  I ll say again  doa.
.. as an 80 s kid . Im discussed with this attempt to make money off something they didn t invent but will only destroy. I think someone said something kinda like that before though  great video!!!!!
this new narnia show is gonna be lit
rings of power will make sharknado look like citizen kane
Im seeing a looooot of cgi... probably gonna be a pass for me. loving the channel so far. good shit!!
all this will settle down when the story of the zulus comes out with chris pratt as shaka zulu  once this happens we will have balance returned and all will be well with the world.
melonie  on a keyboard you can use the   and . keys to go forward or backward one frame while its paused.
not that it means much from some rando on the interwebs  but merry v-day  melonie....disclaimer  this is not simping. this is just being a friendly person. thats it.
melonie mac make my heart go boom
as I said  middle earth shadow of mordor and war  which I am very aware its non-cannon  but its still a better representation of a middle earth spin-off. they even included two black characters in shadow of war and in one of the dlc that would be more lore accurate. them being both baranor and serka and then there is eltariel that meets the most interesting uruks  including 2 that I called the boom brothers that are just fan favoritesall that being said they could ve couldn t use that instead of what they made especially in especially incorporating a system where the fan base could make a nemesis. is much like a american idol typeway I dont like way where they pick up favorite nemesis for talion to fight is 8 and have him as the big bad aside from the plot line villains
knowing how much my mom is a huge fan of the lotr  when she saw this trailer she wasn t thrilled at all... so it probably will be a dumpster fire.
happy valentine s day to melonie the queen of the geeks
happy valentines day!   you are a very beautiful young woman who is extremely personable and wonderful to listen to.  by God if you cant have a great valentine s day  there s no hope for the rest of us.  live long and prespire.
week 1 down let s go!!
never knew you were libertarian but makes sense now. I think it takes more balls to admit that then adding a Bible verse. Ive taken more flak from the right for being a libertarian than from anywhere else but somehow at the same time the left only sees me as far right. its also nice to have another channel other than youngrippa to enjoy.

oh neat  according to the wokies  now we can relate to each other because we obviously could not before we knew this about our same race combination.
@melonie mac go boom  omg  yeah just using that logic breaks my brain and character
im still waiting for the remake of roots with caitlyn jenner as kunta kinte
it reminds me of that  hook  movie with robin williams. amazon could ve just made this without any tolkien ties  but then they couldn t cash in on the fanbase they want to tune in. of course insulting all of them by calling them names wont help that much. now ya ll know how us star wars fans feel.
that thumbnail made me think of dan aykroyd s character in nothing but trouble. you ever seen that movie  its not a very good movie but  it has its moments.
yes this will totally get me through my lonely and crippling depression.. your video not the fact that lotr went woke and is dead on arrival and will have 5 seasons equalivant to got season 8. that makes me want to jump off the highest building in the world in a video game.
so glad I found this channel
I do like the music in the teaser  so maybe the show will at least have a good ost.   personally I feel bad for all the people directly involved with it  who were super excited to be a part of one of their favorite stories  only to work on homebrew version of it. maybe the writers forgot that people  connect with characters  not colors. in the show masterchef  the judges often have to remind people that  classics are classics for a reason .  meaning dont change the recipe. you can add your own style  but it cant change or take away from what its supposed to be.    thanks for the Bible verse. it helps me reflect on how there is what culture says is right and wrong  and what God says is right and wrong. essentially watch out when riding modern cultures moral river  as it may just be headed over a waterfall.
Im not a Christian  but I do find wisdom in your Bible verse.
I wonder if those wonders in the world beyond wondering were ever wondered about by tolkien.
before your channel explodes and its a flurry of comments happens  just wanted to say that your voice is refreshing amongst  the message . thank you  fellow 80s carnivore diet baby!
some create  others destroy.
found you by accident... wow! finally someone saying it.no  you dont need a copy of your race on screen in order to relate to it. thank you!
happy valentines day. thank jeremy  for mentioning you  lara  croft  is one of the  first best baes lol
you haven t read the books      canthat be a possible new year s resolution thatsees fruition  lol
happy valentines day!!dont punish yourself  and us.  so mean  so mean....like we re in a relationship or something.stupid is as stupid does.
agreed... there are worse things than  single on valentines day ... ... ...
amazon is counting on this being a success in india I guess.aside from english  all the other languages are in indian languages hindI  tamil  telugu  kannada and malayalam.and since people have no concept of wokeness or crt here  I think they ll just watch it for the animation with their kids.nobody will be looking for a message in something they watch for timepass.
new sub here. found you thanks to the quartering. keep it up melonie!
wow  single on v day and watching the lotr series trailer. I feel your pain.
dont feel bad about being single. I was single 7 years waiting for da one  met her last year may . make yourself grow even more during that time. and the right person will eventually bee there for you
is the rings of power trailer a teaser for how much damage dr. strange did to reality in dr. strange in the multiverse of madness
great commentary. regards from croatia
this is about watching the lotr video  its punishment for sins no one committed.
melonie  just in case you dont know  the   and   keys can move the video frame by frame.
holy abs! impressive.well shit. I cant relate to anything because Im english  german  irish  jewish  cherokee and some other stuff. the likelihood of finding an actor with my same genetic makeup would be very difficult to find. so per the rules of the woke  Imust hate everything ever created ever.edit  my humor is so dark there would be riots if it encountered a woke version of a cop.
it kinda looks like the hobbit movies. but when creators tell the fans not to watch I usually listen.
I have a fan questionI want to get the lotr on home media how should I get it dvd or bluray or both get the theatrical or extended versions or both which is the best option
great vid. keep up the good work.
for me the black elve felt like a real  warrior  the rest are like narnia characters dunno.
evil cannot create anything new  they can only corrupt  - j.r.r tolkien
the funny part of this is its a prequel and none of the checkmarks exist in the future. so were they are killed  or massacred
its ghostbusters 2016 and the last jedI all over again.
there s been enough of bait and switch in this type of current entertainment that we ve all been burned by it. from star wars  star trek  dr. who  she-ra  master s of the universe. the list goes on. fandoms have been attacked and abused for long enough that apathy has settled in and they are abandoning ship
I wish women were more like you. you just became my second favorite hero  next to bill burr.
they gotta know most of the country is laughing at them by now.
just some guy has said several times that he relates to peter parker because he was a teenager in new york dealing with a lot of the same things that peter does in the comics. he feels no connection to miles morales because the only thing they have in common is skin tone.
feels more narnia than middle-earth
found you thru jeremy from the quartering. you rock.
love youre getting sponsored ads for liberty university  go flames!
melonie single on valentines and desperately pausing a trailer to check out a naked dude
the two people with moose packs could just be returning from a sucessful hunt
Im single on valentine s day spit takesisn t that a surprise  next thing you know  she ll say its because she hasn t found a like-minded okie with long hair and a slight problem with cake. ha ha. wouldn t that be crazy guys  ... guys  why are you all looking at me like that  no  like  I know a guy. .... guys
looking forward to the amazon prime remake of shaka zulu where all zulus are race-swapped and with oscar isaac in the main role.
good to know - thank youuuu
lol yeah they weren t thinking hard on that. because all they ve done is left some really dark implications.
@roukera sati  its like rogue one. you cant have any of the people alive other than main characters who are in the story in the future.
@ian gustafson  thats true!
rofl
best dark humor   wondershowzen
trailer feels more like a video game trailer
I treat movies like poison food  I let someone with similar tastes try it first. trouble is  there s been way too many poisoned movies and Im running out of willing tasters.
before the rings  but isildur is there... wtf !
what s truly sad is there are so many books that j.r.r. tolkien wrote in middle earth. they could easily put together a timeline for the middle earth and do an epic middle earth series. dont gender swap or race swap  do what j.r.r. wrote.
the moose hunters are supposed to represent the harfoots  who were a tribe of hobbits. the thing is that hobbits  while they existed during the second age  wondered around the continent until 1 600 years into the third age until the kingdom of arnor discovered them as the hobbit clans were migrating to the west lands of eriador  western middle earth  and took them in to live and take care the land known later as the shire. the numenoreans made an oath to the hobbits to protect them and their lands at the exchange that the hobbits take care of the land and provide food for the kingdom  and also to occasionally provide them with some archers because hobbits are mentioned to be surprisingly good at throwing stuff at people or shooting them with a bow . other than that  the hobbits of the shire were given autonomy. after aragorn became king  he kept this oath. also  people are mad at the black elf because he s not been explained at all  his hair doesnt make sense at all   all elves have long silky hair   and he feels forced in for the sake of  inclusivity . you know how they can save the black elf character  make him a half elf. tolkien mentions that half elves besides elrond s family exist. however  elrond s family line is the only one that was given the choice by eru iluvatar  the one God of this universe  to choose whether they wanted to share their fate with men  become mortal  age  and die like a normal human  or share their fate with the elves. the unique dilemma with this choice that his family has family has is that when an elf dies  they go to the halls of mandos  kind of like a waiting room realm of the dead for elves  and their spirits reside there until they reincarnate into an identical physical body thousands of years later in valinor  land of the valar  high angelic spirits made by eru iluvatar   because their bodies and spirits are bound to the world of arda  the planet of this universe. middle earth is a continent of this world  and its fate. when men die  they go straight to eru iluvatar s side. what happens to their spirits once they get there  only eru iluvatar knows because neither the elves or valar know what happens after men s spirits embrace eru s realm.
hImelonie seeing this trailer again theonly person who I recognize was thehobbit with red hair.other than that Im not feeling Lord of the rings.Im seeing something thats insulting the Lord of therings books movies.you rock melonie Ive always enjoy seeing what your beendoing keep being you.takecare melonie
I liked the book of elI because I identified with the main character
good luck on the new channel.
I can accept dragons existing in a setting that has dragons  magic in a setting that has magic  people coming back from the dead in a setting that has such. I will not accept any of these in settings where they dont belong  even the wrong kinds of dragons  magic  or undeath for the setting in question.by the same token  I can accept black elves in a setting that is supposed to have black elves and will not accept black elves in a setting where they aren t supposed to exist. its not about how common these things are in our world  its about their believability in the world in question. immersion is a matter of logical  internal consistency.
there is no curse in elvish  entish  or the tongues of men for this treachery. j.r.r. tolkien  the two towers
thumbnail on point
there can be wizards and dragons in lotr  but that doesnt mean that that allows us to make any change  like making hobbits with huge butts instead of feet or making every gondorian morbidly obese. thats why lore is a thing
booooom!!!
the verse of the day today is somewhat applicable... intended or not good job
love the scriptures.
happy valentines day mac !!!
the  moose people  are nobody from the novels or other tolkien notes.  pure fanfic.
the only time sex-swapping worked was for boomer and starbuck in battlestar galactica.
doesnt look like the most expensive show ever made  and yet it is.
I wasn t sure what race the moose hunters were. did the vanity fair article state that  or did one of the showrunner interviews state this I am not a fan of hobbit characters being in this show at all. but I understand the  marketing bait  they re supposed to be - after 6 movies of hobbits in middle earth  the showrunners feel compelled to put them in the tv show as a major speaking role.  I just wouldn t have done it. or I would have made it a cameo at most.
@wd  the vanity fair article mentioned them being harfoot hobbits and the showrunners confirmed this in an interview
Im happy you appreciate it lol!
and so far thats really the only reboot that was as good as  in this case  better than  the original. one of my favorite series  ever.
@sergio leone  yes  me too. forever the classic space opera  certainly since the expanse season 5 later episodes  so awful and ridiculous.
hello melonie  never heard of you but dont worry Im no one. saw you with the critical drinker  tomb raider  brilliant show  thanks for that and when drinker realised he s only a couple of years older than you. it made him and the rest of us drink more. its a complement please take it  you look like a blooming fresh faced education 21yr old. and you proved it again with chrissie mayr other great show with a lady I respect. I also watch the quartering and just seen the false drama etc etc. so wishing you all the best and all my respect  Im one of your new subscribers. cheer s     .  edit  shxt  sorry your reaction to what isn t lotr! calmly done.x personal anyone screwing with my childhood memories.
keep it up
there s always that guy who says  but its just this one little change  why cant you handle it  because its always  just one little change ... over and over and over and over and over and over and over again  stopping at nothing  and consuming absolutely everything.
lol  love it.
all the dwarf ladies need to have a healthy beard too  because its rumored that the only beard that can rival that of a dwarf man is one of their women.  this gives me the urge to play everquest again.
how can it be a new legend   the story is thousands of years old  in universe Imean   before the king  which king  not witch king  are they referring to  I would assume there were many kings before aragorn
I am just fine with that
I dont know about you  but being single on valentine s day is great! you do not have to worry about any others but yourself. plus tomorrow a big discount on treats that did not get sold. so go nuts!!
now I know thatsauron hid in amazon after return of the king.
you can either base your world on middle earth or cast don lemon as an elf. not both. they didn t even bother giving him long flowing elvish hair
I dont get why they had to change galadriel. a woman can still be awesome and powerful without needing to suit up in armor and do some sword fighting. gorgo  queen of sparta  was pretty awesome in 300 and she didn t have to follow leonidas out onto the battlefield to demonstrate that. there are different types of power. why does it always come down to battlefield prowess
I think they are hobbits carrying moose antlers  even though there were no hobbits in the 2nd age
I saw a thread on fb regarding the dress and hair styles of the race swapped characters. I laughed at the prospect that these far left woke ideologs  were arguing over whether or not braids and corn rows should be appropriate to represent the culture. what culture  african dreadlocks on elves because that comparison can be made  itspeaks volumes on the mindset of these folks. when you get offended that an elf isn t african enough for you....you should probably just clock out.
your russian is so fluent I love it
Im actually tired of worrying about stocks. its driving me nuts these days I think crypto investment is far better than stock made over  39k in a week.
wait until amazon makes a drizzt series set in menzoberranzan.
the quartering brought me here. you have a new fan. great content.
been watching your channel out of order and made a couple comments about your views lining up well with libertarianism and how you d be a good voice for that. didn t know till now that you self-declared as one already  so now I feel kinda dumb lol.also  woop woop for a fellow irish indian.
well I dont like the woke stuff.but I hope the series will be good in the end. and the epic music in the trailer is fantastic! I like your make up
it feels like they have taken scenes from different movies and combined it to one trailer. the blonde one looks like jack frost  the young person looks like that deer-kid character in that new series on netflix. and aren t dwarf-women suppose to have beard according to gimlI  hmm
im ok with change as long as it respects the source material. I like adding a new character or even telling a new story that runs paralell to existing stories. but the writers must respect the world
@peter h  at some point you need to realize that what they re doing is intentional vandalization.
@knowbody  oh yeah! they doesnt understand a good story or good characters.
why thank you
stocks are good but crypto is more profitable. not to be compared.
hello please I need help am a newbie lost over  6 000 a week ago is they any opinion on how to gain back
oops thats a huge lost.
you have to get more experience first  work with a professional on crypto to guide you step-by-step.
thats a good idea but how do I get an experienced trader  I dont know anyone sorry to bother you mate do you have any that I could work with
okay  I trade with expert dave javens his an excellent analytical broker and account manager. well known.
he ll help yourecover your money. but must take caution  on the broker you invest with.
this is good news. please how do I reach your broker.

thanks  will get to him right away
woooo that man his good work has  been everywhere. been seeing a lot of good comments about him on several places. I feel more confident investing with him  Ive been on the train for over two weeks now... best broker for life.
happened in a space of two weeks I was shocked when I got the notice...
Ive got 12th winning as Im currently using his signals thanks he s really the best.
to me it is  been working with him for a year and four months. and I have been getting my profits seems legit to me
Im from the australia       I and my cousin gave him a try and it has been good returns of our investment  thanks expert dave javens
I could go on about the crapulence that passes for hollywood today but I ll boil it down to this  I know Im not the only one who s just completely tired and burned out over endless remakes and sequels that progressively get worse and worse. you add the woke thing into the mix and you have a recipe for a cinematic epic fail.
mel  whaddya you mean  you people  queezy .....whadda you mean  you people
big disagree on the  I am no man  line. I loved the scene  but the line annoyed me because thats not what let her kill him  and they just kind of glossed over that in the movies. they conveniently did not explain thatshe could only kill him because merry s dagger undid the magic protecting the witch king  allowing her to strike a fatal blow.
this is gonna get claimed  just so you know mel. keep it up and thank you jeremy.
good content. also  your abs are on point.
if you want ethnic people to feel at one with a character. put them in jordan retro s without the jumpman on the back and unity will be had.
this reminds me more of....the golden compass..anyone remember that
lol  should have guessed you were a libertarian. already been enjoying your channel  but now  2 respect.
melonie this dumpster fire  just needs to burn.
those comment s are just so blissfull. thank illuvatar I had the chance to witness them. last alliance indeed.

I would love to donate to your channel but do not have subscribe star. would it be possible to donate to your channel via paypal  also  love the Bible verses and your take on them.
didn t eowyn almost die after fighting the witch king  she had like  mad poison on her arm and didn t  shock gasp shock  aragorn  help heal her  effing toxic masculinity...
you did a Bible verse  subscribed!!!
now they re calling fans racist   when someone results to insult  thats when you know they ve lost the argument.
the only thing they got right was the title- and even then  ring  and  power  were used often by tolkien. as for making  the book that tolkien didn t write  really translates to   hey guys let s just make up any standard shit and call it tolkien s just to sell it. just like chronicles of shannara  wheel of time and the witcher. and so what if fans dont like it- we tell them what to watch  and if it does tank- we ll make a tax-write off. there s plenty of other franchises we can destroy later...
im just happy jeremy brought me too your channel
heya. dont sweat it. been single for 25 years. Im on my 25th playthrough of resident evil 4.  when life gets you down leon boI will always save the day. amazon is going to be the arasaka of the future. nothing they do is consumer friendly.
15 07youre killing me  sweetie.
I cant relate to wesley snipes.I still am a massive fan of the blade films.
that line was in the book too
yeah it already has a copyright claim on it  but no strike. so I just cant monetize it but it can stay up. for now at least
@melonie mac go boom  haha  yay for  not quite  little wins.
eyyy thank you so much!
@melonie mac go boom  yep. Im new to your stuff  but its pretty cool. keep it up. the workout info is motivating too.
thank you so much  I appreciate it  I have a link for leaving a tip in my description on my twitch channel  twitch.tv meloniemac  and that goes directly to my paypal. again thank you so much  that is so kind of you!
unabashed outspoken faith in God.....its the new punk rock.
commenting to feed the algorithm .  getting closer to hitting thatsubscribe button.
that trailer is the epitome of  teaser .  which could make sense if they were only trying to appeal to die-hard lore junkies.  isn t that funny  though  since they ve invested most of their creativity into re-writing things for their own devices   curious
roses are red  violets are blue tolkien s elves were all white and gollum was too.
eowyn s line didn t feel forced in the movie because it was written that way by tolkien  it respected the established lore. which this travesty amazon is spewing  will not.
what bothers me isn t non-european looking characters  its that they dont implement them in a way that makes sense. game of thrones had the dothrakI  unsullied  people from dorne  etc  there were loads of non-white characters in the show  and it worked because they re from different regions and countries and had their own culture  clothing  and languages. having black people randomly among the other characters with no indication that they re from somewhere else  as if its modern day america  makes it look extremely silly and ruins the immersion. it already happened with the witcher.
the rings of power trailer looks like the star wars the force awakens trailer to me.
that Bible quote is the one Jesus referred to when he talked about the unforgivable sin . blasphemy against the holy spirit .. after the pharisees accused him of being the devil
twilight of the rings by the look of it.
the original lotr rules! the rest..... meh. this one is just a heresy    cheers from russia  mel!
they use a beloved property to cash in on its popularity and cultural value while at the same time attacking and demonizing the hardcore fanbase thatspent years actually caring and supporting that property with their time and money  all in a pathetic attempt to appeal to the lowest common denominator among clueless normies  disgusting.
trying not to hurl lol!!! tried to give it a chance but no sorry not sorry!!! why even make this movie!!!
representation in media is not merely about  relating  to a specific character. people who come from marginalized communities often dont see characters who look like them portrayed in media. more often they are exposed to negative stereotypes about people from their own communities  which leads them to believe they need to act or behave in certain ways in order to be accepted into society. these thoughts and images become internalized  which will often lead to major issues later in life like low self-esteem  depression  and in extreme cases self harm or suicide. all because they are struggle with their identity. now do I think having some black elves dwarves is really going to be this great advancement towards equality  of course not  and I agree that what they are doing with these casting choices seems very forced and virtue signally. I dont think black people are going to be offended if there weren t any black people in lotr  especially since the peter jackson films weren t really diverse. I think they would ve enjoyed this as lotr fans regardless because its fantasy. but I think folks are complaining about  woke-washing  in general a little too much  especially since representation in media is empirically proven to be beneficial towards marginalized groups.
well at least they got numenor right
like wheel of time  star wars  and star trek  it looks pretty but it has no soul or no true spark of inspiration. its basically the meme where they turn unique and colorful things into npc grey blocks.
isn t there a whole realm of non-white people south of mordor   it would have been a great story to show those civilizations fighting against being enslaved by mordor  and fighting against the prejudices other races have against them because they were forced to follow sauron.
once you go mac u never go back
its nice to see a woman who actually understands tolkiens world. this is no way near canon. it looks like amazon took a big shit on the greatest novels of literature of the 20th and 21st century.  why does everything have to be so political  just stick to how the books were written! Jesus this looks tribble!
1 billion dollars for cocaine  thats how  rings of power  was made
the shadow that bred them can only mock  it cannot make  not real things of its own. I dont think it gave life to the orcs  it only ruined them and twisted them.   j.r.r. tolkein
there have been black actors and black characters in us cinema and comics since the late 60s  its nothing new and most people had zero issues with it  fresh prince of bel-air  beverly hills cop  m.a.n.t.i.s  black panther  storm  blade ...etc what people have issues with is tokenization  race swapping and bastardization of beloved classical works with modern political agendas  mainly the use of token minority or female characters as shields from criticism as well as fake-bragging by the creators who are only doing this to virtue-signal about their real-life divisive far-left political ideology.all in an pathetic endeavor to satisfy their bloated egos and act holier-than-thou towards everyone else thinking themselves above regular people and above any criticism  also when their movies tv shows fail its much easier for them infront of investors to blame the imaginary bigots for that failure than to admit they royally screwed up and the movie tv show they made was lazy garbage
I have no interest whatsoever in seeing this. Im still seething over what they did to the wheel of time. the books were so amazing and they turned it into a steaming pile of woke trash.
they should replace power with  the rings of woke ....the most notable actor in this crappy series is lenny henry. a  comedian.
galadriel looks like brienne of tarth! good job bezos littlefinger
production quality looks pretty good. visually this trailer is impressive. but I dont wanna watch this  not because of the diverse characters  but because of the far left ideologues that are running it.
when are you going to put the Bible reference in the description  its a little hard to pause and type it every time. Im also a native how do feel about bannock and salmon
its just a whole lot of visual spectacle with zero of the profound substance that made tolkien s work so resonant. this is the real reason there s no direct dialogue in the teaser besides some weak narration as that would actually mean they would have to write something original. modern script writers are absolutely incapable of this  every property they re given is a vehicle for their political ideology instead of one for their creativity. I ll never touch this garbage.
lmao that eowyn line is literally the cringiest thing in the trilogy.
sounds like cartman when he was getting back at pc principal
sewer fire
happy  day to u melonie mac go boom

how did the tolkein estate sign off on wokeism
irish gollum confirmed 2 54
we need more libertarians
miserable   life is coasting nicely single
its core and ending will be the same as the game  the last of us 2
1 57 these are pokemons traveling
wonders beyond our wandering  not wondering

yeah thatshow is gonna be a thanks but no thanks for me.
0 24 thatsucks  I am willing to help u with that
there are wonders in the world beyond our wandering   bad writing  there are wonders beyond our wandering   better writing
I read all of tolkien s books about middle earth and they never said anything about these moose knuckle hobbits.
drow elves in d d are black. no one has a problem with that. all of these same ppl talking about race swapped elves in middle earth would have an equal problem with a d d based movie where the drow were not black. no one has a problem with black characters. our problem is the disregard for fictional lore to spread a woke agenda
sept 2nd was the day tolkien died...
the great replacement
fans want tolkienism  not tokenism.thats why they dont like that they will release it on 2th september.thats the day tolkien died.
congrats.  lotr by amazon is a skip for me.
and all of the simps entered the chat when you said you are single....
they are supposed to be hobbits but hobbits didn t exist until about 600 years into the 3rd age and this is based in the second age.
new fan
the moose people are the hobbits or harfoots.
so woke. I hope they go so broke.
if melonie max were president  she would be baberaham lincoln.
hey not sure why on the youtube mobile it was hard to find your video  but I am subbed  but on my pc it wasn t hard  youtube  u know....  me I dont care about who people are having sex with  I would rather see bad ass fight scenes  like the original Lord of the rings  also it is a fiction world  not real life
morfydd clark is gorgeous looking  but this series will do her no favours this fall.
we ll hang out next valentine s day if youre still single then. I ll be backup.
17 300 subs! Im doing my part!
yeeeees. its so racist with the you cant relate to xyz like you said  people are so insane.
we can see those awesome abs!
if you ever come to the netherlands I would like to take you out for dinner and be a perfect gentleman old skool style.
ooooh we can improve tolkien s work.the utter heresy. they couldn t wait for Christopher to die so they could shit upon his father s legacy.
where is the horse and the rider  where is the horn that was blowing  they have passed like rain on the mountain  like wind in the meadow. the days have gone down in the west behind the hills into shadow...
why bring up valentines day  I completely forgot that was today. oh well.
.
Im only 7 but I go boom!
if this trailer was all white dudes   melanie mac   woo-hoo greeeaatest traileeeer eveeer!    yeee haaaaw!
2 37 it isn t over until the fat dwarf sings.
whats sad now days is when you are called racist or sexist now days it means youre winning an argument.... because now days if you try to criticize something you just get called racist and sexist for having an opinion...
great entertainment is dead. hopefully  my entertainment company be up and running also with my youtube channel. hold up melonie youre single  shooting time...... oh yeah I cant shoot
boom baby
I love lotr but this ain t it chief
lel its monday  wifu at work me at work at home  it was going to suck anyway  its work day nothing we could fo about it xd  also strangely   or well not so  they didnt swap any character  the right to it didnt allowed it xd  but they added their shit  and gave them more importance than it really has which is nothing  so black elve doesnt exist  black dwarf  doesnt exist  this inclusive hartfoots diesnt exist  singel mom doesnt exist  and they cucked the male characters aparently while making men like the women.... expected and well  its trash
so what would be the catch phrase from batman played by a black actor   Im blackma......uh batman ...
the cgI looked d d movie levels of bad
youre irish and native american oh  your poor liver    cue angry moth noises
at 2 08 look how bad that cgI is though. looks like a ps4 game. I love how the entire world is quoting jrr tolkien s  evil cannot create  in their own language in the comments
its bad  but still not as bad as that trailer for battwoman!!
j.r.r.token
how you single   sheeeeeit.
they are doing the same crap with the new halo show
oooo wow
Im just glad they haven t made the elves   non binary   yet  ........
1
the antler dudes  like most of this tv show  are fan fiction. really bad fan fiction  so far.
God of war actually looks better.
yeah I agree it looks more like the hobbit than lotr
well maybe you should make an efort and read the books so you can at least give an informed opininon
1  the girl talking is not in the books2  the who dudes with moose horns are not in the books3  galadriel never had armor nor weapons. she was to powerfull for that bullshit  now stronk and brave female 4  no black nor bald short hair elves exists in tolkiens world5  text  before the king  there were many kings before and during this time  in the very next scene they show a elf in golden robe   thats gil-galad the king!  6  no black dwarves exists. the few female dwarves we hear about all have beards like the male dwarves...I guess that black female dwarf have a sun in her cave where she gets her tan on.7  what this show do have is wokenessso 90  of the shots in the selling first teaser are amazon made. I guess fuck the tolkien fans
woke point to bad behavior to justify their own.
the woke of the rings.
I agree with most comments. long time fan through tomb raider. but star trek has not race or gender swapped anyone.
Im having trouble believing some one as pretty as you is single.there are black elves  we know them as drow. but I dont think those were ever in tolkien lore.and your scripture dose seem to fit here.
just wanted you to know I got my wife the best v-day gift ever. I got her the gift of me imo the trailer is trying to hard to be something its not. its trying to say  Im deep and inspiring  but its clear it lacks substance and comes off as shallow and is void of any depth.
one of the big reg flags. it looks like a jj bad robot production. you get a trailer that is all flash and no substance that everything feels off about it. like his star trek movies  and disney star wars trash.
how the heck are you single
personally  I find the trailer music to be bland and boring too. nothing adding and it just screams   Im a trailer  be excited.
I think its more racist making the black dwarf a single mom  than leaving her out would ever be.
as a player of lotro  n viewer of lotr this absolute terrible
pretty nahhh
the first thing I wonder is  how can someone so beautiful be single on this day  and about the new lotr series--its cringe. no one likes it except the woke people. peter jackson s lotr might not be perfect  but that was still far better than this one.
a polished counterfeit. thats what the rings of woke is.
single !!!!
its cgI  wow absolute crap
I haven t read the books  but from everything Ive heard from people that did  this show will be terrible. race swapping is the least of its problem s.
why are you complaining and triggered by this new show if you haven t even read the books
very  bland very  safe very  boring very  shit that  its  !!
I stay in my home or at the gym 24 7 and haven t had a proper crush on anyone in ages
@melonie mac go boom  you are in fantastic shape and inspire me to get back into it. dont wait too long to make a decision though about a partner  I found out the hard way what waiting does. blessed to have our daughter  but it was a struggle. good luck with your new channel  I ll be watching!
from my last comment  I ll be staying away from this as far as possible. I ll watch the old movies  read the books and consider it cannon. this show isn t cannon to me just like the new star wars movies.
see a lotta people following you just for the new political stuff. been here for all the tomb raider stuff for years lol
no way home was a fine film. the rings of power  trash. guaranteed.
we wuz elves n shieet
its a cluster fu@k.........how sad. where is the respect for the fans  the lore  why the race swapping  why weaken such a strong character  pathetic.......
this isn t Lord of the rings though is it. it is bog standard hollywood cliched rings. wokeism can be summed up from the movie get shorty.  is that the crippled gay guy who climbs mount whitney... .
this amazon trailer seems a bit racist to me. where is the uighur muslim representation. or the tribes people of the amazon basin. what about the english woman who identifies as a canadian wolfdo they care about minorities at all  j r r token would be ashamed to put his name to it.
I disagree that the  I am no man  line is good. its a terrible line. he didnt mean gender when he said  man.  he meant race. so this line is just as cringy as when a feminist says  peoplekind.
you want black lady dwarves great go create your own series of books  leave tolkien alone and why culturally appropriate northern european mythology  go rip your own mythology to shreds.
it was in the book
@melonie mac go boom  what does that have to do with it
@mike williams  Lord of the rings is based of  uh  books
@negano  youre asking me if lotr is based on a book  yes.
