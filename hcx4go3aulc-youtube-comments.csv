melonie   I hope good people are ok and can recover. josh   we aren t good people! how dare you! I obviously rolled up a delusional evil character!
thanks to jeremy from the quartering sharing this story  this meltdown has only served to bring attention to your channel. Im sure Im not the only one who has become a new sub since this came out
melonie mac is a kindly soul. over 2 years ago she bothered to take time to voice support toward me in a comment section when I was going through the initial part of a separation that led to my divorce. she s a legit nice person  and only a very very sick person would misinterpret that.
as someone who has been attacked on social media for my faith a couple of years ago  I can understand the feelings involved especially when said faith was not even the topic. stay strong mel! love your input and takes with all this g4 craziness.
I am here to show support. your comments had good intentions and you feel for those who lost their jobs at g4.
as an ex gamestop employee who suffered through the repetitive commercials I have to say. you surprised me after I found your socials. you are down to earth and real. and Im glad to have discovered you after cursing you and all the others for hearing commercials on repeat over and over and over again. thanks for being you. hope my daughter and son learn from you and others like you for not taking shit and standing up for what you believe and being kind about it
he s apparently as good at fostering sympathy on twitter as frosk is at keeping the fanbase enthusiastic.
doing amazing! hoping youtube doesnt take a large portion. any way  well done on letting negativity just roll off! cantell you have a different energy with your parents in town. keep booming!  as always!
youre not an outcast mel. youre not in the overly vocal minority. we ve all got your back!
when you tell the truth  even in a gentle  graceful way   it attacks the lies that people tell themselves  and others   which is why they attack you. dont let itstress you out  you didn t do anything wrong. keep speaking the truth in a loving respectful way  as we are commanded to do by God.  love ya girl!  edited for rewording and because my grammar is trash  lol
this dude  frosk  adam sessler what a pleasant bunch
coming from another chick who loves gaming and has a knack for being blunt but fair  no this is normal but shouldn t be. and you keep being you. lead by example as you are Imad respect you even if this is the first time Ive seen your content. thank you. thank you very much ma am.
your tweet was reasonable  didn t call anyone specific out and was gracious. these people are psychopaths.
as a Christian  I love that youre so brave to share your unpopular beliefs.
you are one of my favorite people to follow for your takes. Im surprised josh wasn t aware of what happened with will smith because once youread his tweet it instantly gave me will smith vibes  for adam sessler you say you feel bad for him due to his family problems right now but he previously wished death upon his republican family members so like I think its hard to feel bad for him if he s getting what he wished for
how can he not believe one person cantank an entire company  itseems to happen pretty often in gaming and entertainment.
I just discovered your channel and its refreshing to see someone with their own thoughts and opinions  unafraid to stick to their guns. respect.
apparently being nice and wishing people well is a trigger for some   who knew.  keep being your amazing self and smile on
consider this melonie... if you had frosks job at g4tv  these former g4 employees would probably still have a job today
really like your content happy to know you are a Christian  .   keep up the great videos!!
let me make mention your Christianity while Im at it!
lol.
you cant reason with angry people  and josh is clearly very angry.
Im surprised this person has the nerve to assume he speaks for everyone he worked with.
he should be happy he supported the people who told people if you dont like it dont watch he got what he wanted
one thing is for sure they are not good people
@galadrius the mighty  yeah  really being subtle about their discriminatory feelings there aren t they

@vgamingjunkie  subtlety isn t their best suit.
whenever they go after your faith just tell them to do that exact same thing with islam not a single one of them will do it they are all cowards
@gundham tanaka  never seen any evidence of that but ooook
yeah  nice to find another person that gets what is going on and can see through the bs while staying solid.
intelligence must have been his dump stat.
@vgamingjunkie  I encourage them to continue to do so. we get to see conservative muslims flip on em and then you have mexico being 98  catholic and they openly show disdain for their core beliefs. it wont take  but to try and do something that comes after the religious to see them all flip on the left. latinos already backed a conservative mexican national who flipped a long time democrat district. the right has the weapons  we just need to openly support them. I didn t even know about her until she won. granted I dont live in texas  but her name should be in the mouth of every conservative. same with the puerto rican who is polling better in aocs district. she s also conservative and if she flips the pr vote  I believe that would oust aoc and she d take over a district in ny. its beautiful to behold
I know Im in love.
this! I always baffled with some of the wokies  whoever and wherever they are  stance with faith. some of them hate Christian bc  the religion of invaders  enslavers  and pdos  and supporting their version of islam  blatantly supporting the radicals just because they endgame the opposing faith they hate  most of my country hate isis - the radicals praises them  smh . especially about hijab. some of them claim they support diversity  but opposed hijab bc  patriarchal oppresion  - despite some of us wear it out of their free will  without being forced  and just want to live their life according to our belief...but nooo  they claim opression on our behalf. like  bruh.
they haven t learnt how to respect anyone nor anything not of their ilk.
@nick scarlato  lol  what
@nick scarlato  I agree. her original tweet is at best condescending towards frosk and management. also the  ... hopefully we all learn awesome rainbow unicorn lessons from frosk and managements  fuck-ups  portion is quite elitist. Im not saying melonie is a bad person. that is just how her tweet comes off.
@gage reed  good  hopefully thats how she intended it
@nick scarlato  yes  she is entitled to her opinion  but to play the victim card after someone s visceral reaction to your own visceral  tone-deaf finger-waggling critique is.... I dont even know. odd
@nick scarlato  point out specifically where in her tweet where she takes jabs at the people who lost their dream jobs. she took a jab at the specific individual who ran their mouth and caused a domino effect in the company  while wishing well on the rest. I would say anyone who ignorantly runs their mouth at the fans deserves to be called out on it without being accused of having a  visceral  attitude.
@nick scarlato  so if you criticize anyone or any groups for any reason at all youre trying to be divisive and therefore immoral to a certain degree  let me guess  you also happen to not be a practicing Christian or a conservative. weird I randomly guessed that. nah homie. you and your side are the bad guys here.
@gage reed  what s wrong with being condescending or criticizing management though  I was unaware this is a sin. we should tell everybody who filed against the nazis and just voice to criticism that they were doing something wrong and they deserved to be mistreated or they weren t trying to do the right thing.
@nick scarlato   people lost their jobs and youre taking jabs at them  where did she take jabs at people who lost their jobs   I didn t say she took jabs at people who lost their jobs  youre a clown dude lol
@nick scarlato  please please please respond to my quotes when you said she s jabbing at people they lost their jobs and then you immediately said you never said that. Im going to screenshot it before you try and change it too
@nick scarlato  like the only arguments you have nick because you are a dishonest player  is the totally lie about what the tweet said and then when you were called on it did you say you never said that and then to just read in her intentions for well wishes and somehow insult her for having the nicest way Ive ever seen someone criticize management or another person is that being somehow wrong for them to do. you can voice your support and also criticize what caused the need for you to voice your support and thats perfectly reasonable and acceptable and everyone does that and thats 100  just as moral and acceptable and kind and loving as just voicing your support with no criticism for what caused the support. like if a white supremacist shoots up a black church  you can condemn the white supremacy and what the person did specifically by name and voice your support and youre not a worst person or less of a victim if you are attacked by other white supremacist then if you were to just voice your support. do you understand  good now you can admit why you were wrong logically just in the argument you attempted to make or you can defend people being criticized for calling out white supremacy because thatsomehow immoral. you cant have it both ways. you can say she was wrong about her criticism in the management and frosk did nothing worthy of criticism. that would just mean she s intellectually incorrect and thats not anything immoral or makes her any less of a victim. even though you are using the word victim  not us.
on a side note  I hate that a golden hearted angel like melonie is a pariah in the gaming industry  and people like this guy are still welcome.
@david low  100   we are living in an upside down world. evil is good  good is evil.
great comment.
@c j  yup. why on earth would someone as difficult to look at and listen to as frosk ever be hired as a host
@thievnwalrus  thank you  I had no idea it would go over so well.
@c j  its called reprobate
thank you so much
bless you  thank you so much
you could  though  leave them alone. imagine random people on the other side of the world sticking their nose into your business when you get fired.
@eric staples  pardon me if I dont care about the feelings of the  people  that have been calling me a nazI white supremacist for 7 years. I have o pity for them across the board. thats me being overtly nice about it
@eric staples  its a public platform. therefore its a public debate. any other youtube channel will be talked about the same. try guys is a good example where public jobs will not always be handled privately. nobody is going to random jobs and talking about how you personally got fired. plus she didn t say anything wrong but support and call out the obvious that an employee attacked the fans. which should be a no brainer that thats a bad or move for your whole company.
grace comes from God. thats why they hate itso much. they hate God and everything he created.
@eric staples  a media company that makes money off of an audience  that has public personalities that make money by gaining popularity does not   omg its private. if you want privacy dont be a media personality.
@eric staples  well you wont get a free job  if your mindset to a past possible customer is to give them a middle finger essentially through text. its like at a certain point it pays not to be an arse irl.
unpopular beliefs
@disappointed in all of you  why because a Christian voices support for sharing an unpopular belief  are you claiming in almost all media  especially gaming  being Christian and conservative isn t unpopular  because that would be wild.
@disappointed in all of you  certainly any sane person would admit that Christianity is vastly unpopular in social media
@jesse  its the most subscribed to religion on the planet with a full third of the global population being some kind of Christian. it is the exact opposite of  unpopular .
@campbellsoup93  can you say anything bad about islam  judaism  hinduism  buddhism  or sikh without being labeled an istaphobe  numbers dont matter when all legacy media gives a free pass to bash a religion.
@campbellsoup93  that doesnt mean its popular within the culture  especially when it comes to being in certain professions like the gaming industry  the music industry or hollywood. did you just ignore all my arguments dude  you dont typically get applauded for being a Christian in western civilization. you typically get applauded and not shut down for going against Christian teachings. are you actually going to deny that  Im talking about the main mediums the influence culture. it is the most popular religion. but thats not relevant to the conversation or the point being made. if you think it is youre going to have to actually break that down and explain it. not just state the fact that you feel like is relevant
@campbellsoup93  so you are correct. I never said Christianity is an unpopular religion so Im not sure who you are arguing with
@disappointed in all of you  great argument.
title achievement  entitled
esp in recent yrs when all it takes is some stupid post on instagram or twitter or some weird announcement by the developers of any videogame ..and its over for the entire company falls because they have morons in charge....
ya know..... youre right....and when a guy s right.... they re right....
probably not
eh  maybe. I think itstill would have went tits-up sooner rather than later because they basically had a 2002-era cable channel business plan. but youre right that frosk started a domino effect which ended it much more quickly. mel would have been a little smarter. if adam cessler didn t get her fired for being a Christian that is.
I doubt it. they had way too much overhead. frosk was the nail in the coffin but it was doomed from conception.
only if g4tv were not woke.
@prime-of-two  honestly  I think the raging comments from the ex-employees are incorrect. frosk definitely caused the channel to fail.gamers have been attacked by woke activists as far back as gamergate. they re pretty quick to notice when companies are trying to lecture to them or berate them for being gamers and thats exactly what frosk did.
and there would be no complaints about fuckability.
nah.  if she were the person in charge of deciding what got uploaded and what didn t they might.  frost s dumbass rant was stupid  but what was 100 times as stupid is that at least a dozen people with the power to make sure that never saw the light of day didn t step in and probably actively supported it.  they are the ones responsible for tanking the network  and one could argue that anybody who made the decision to hire a toxic personality like frank for the cameras wasn t fit to have that position in the first place.  if anybody hires fork for anything besides manual labor out of the public eye after this  they get what they deserve.  I feel sorry for anybody she has to work with in the future.
great point.
yeah stuff like this is for the many reasons whyIve never done facebook  twitter  instagram  or tik tok.and Im great without it.no unnecessary stress  putting up with ignorant people  no wondering how people know so much about your personal lifeeven though you put your autobiography for the world to see on facebook. no drama of any kind.having none of that crap aboveequals happier and healthier life.
I d say you come across as a really nice person  and the world needs more like you.
props for standing your ground. thats hard to do these days.
you got your crew right here  we got your back no matter who gets triggered by the truth.
imagine being a complete melvin like josh snapping at a completely chill and thoughtful post by melonie.
melonie youre a gem. it was a sweet comment that only the bad eggs would be irritated with. keep doing you. much love
keep on sharing your faith  my friend.  Im with you!
your faith got you a subscriber today.its nice to see someone with brains in the gaming industry
youre definitely not insane. stay strong  keep it up!
trolls will be trolls and if you give them an inch they will take a foot.... they thrive on attention and if you dont give it to them they will just stew on their bitterness.  the more you try to explain yourself the more they will feel they accomplished their goal... ignoring them is the best approach.  state your pov and let it be it  it is your channel after all      keep up the good work with your awesome videos!!!!!
adam sezzler has always given  my wife s boyfriend  vibes to me. Im not surprised by his emotional outburst.
adam sessler has  loved ones     nooo way and you will never be alone following your faith and us fans follow you keep up the good work.
Ive been following you for years even when I dont watch or see everything you create cuz I appreciate when someone  especially a woman  can call out the bullshit narratives and agendas that the world loves to spin. also youre genuine asf
you shouldn t see or feel yourself as an outcast in the gaming industry melonie. everyone s entitled to their own opinion. doesnt make yours any less than theirs. what I find despicable is that they often attack people s personality  what they believe in .. if they simply disagree with them or they dislike something about you or whatever. its unreal sometimes how you cant have normal discussions anymore. keep it up melonie! I love your accent btw
mel we got your back because you were being cool and classy.  you speak your opinions in a very respectful manner and Ive never seen you just go at anyone.  that dude was obviously feeling some type of way about you.
been subscribed for a bit now and I just wanted to come by and let you know that we have your back. g4tv is completely lost and tone deaf. be aware that you have more fans than them!
rest in pieces g4tv. all that virtue signaling was your undoing.
dont feel down or like youre alone when you see these tweets. these people are so filled with hate while preaching tolerance inclusivity. youre doing a great service by speaking about these issues.
I am subscribing just because you are standing firm on your faith.
melonie you are right about your only fans tweet because in a marriage  trust is crucial to make the whole thing work. if you sell the image of your body to millions of viewers  that trust is completely gone because you are giving the intimate part of that union to everyone else who wants it. the marriage means nothing at that point. you might as well be roommates who share the bills.
@prime-of-two  oh man youre right. sessler would have canceled mel.
good point
agreed
this is actually a really  really astute observation. as someone who is only marginally aware of the gaming community  I cantell you stumbling across frosk s rant immediately eliminated any chance I would explore g4. I dont fault the point she was making  but thats absolutely the worst possible manner in which to make it. there can be an intelligent  necessary discourse about sexism in an industry without someone delivering a screeching diatribe using the broadest  most derisive strokes to paint every member of the majority audience as rampant misogynists. yes  frosk s rant contributed to what happened. melanie handled the topic with grace   despite it not really being her responsibility to sugarcoat it. joshua miller was out of line here and needs to get over himself.  keep our names out of your mouth   okay  spanky. I agree. we should all avoid ever mentioning you again. that way we can collectively move past the g4 dumpster fire and leave it where it belongs  rotting at the bottom of the dustbin of history.
word!
@duane ullery  sure  a debate like that can be had. its just that a platform like g4tv is not the proper venue for it.its supposed to be entertainment for gamers. so debates about  gender issues in the industry  will ultimately turn gamers off from watching it. it becomes a giant wet rag on the whole mood of the show. especially so when delivered in an angry  self entitled rant like frosk pulled off.
@little sausage  yeah  but they wouldn t have been fired yet. frosk definitely accelerated things by more than a month. they d have lasted probably another six months without the rant.
idk might be a movie reference
@melvin deeply  I know there s cool melvins out there  like yourself just like there are cool karens out there. its just a name for cringy and awkward duds. much like how karen is used to describe annoying women.
I always thought the male version of karens were kevins
@melvin deeply  its an 80 s thing  I think
imagine being so out of it thatsnapping at others that dont deserve it makes you feel better. oy.
melvin doo was pretty cool.
I knew I wasn t the only one who used that word lol. just another word for calling someone a dope.
@melvin deeply  its saved for people who aren t born with that name who are just such a dope lol.
@pab  I heard that name used in an episode of south park by stan marsh  for pip  butters  and  dougie .
tf is a melvin
@melvin deeply  I thought melvin were stacy orbiters while stacies are chad orbiters  thats what the meme implied
I love the melvins
@xan ostler  hey now!
@spicyoctopus  this is the comment I came here for.
I can. I can imagine someone frustrated losing their job and then lashing out at people.because they have a built up anger   stemming from thoughts that are likely unfounded.
@galadrius the mighty  Ive imagined that. Ive done that. it doesnt make you feel better in the long run  it makes you feel something though.
when you rt something only your followers see the comment. so he had to be following her to know what she said to the company. why follow someone you whole heartedly disagree with.  complete troll.
@galadrius the mighty  imagine being delusional enough to not see an coworker was not being brave but being dumb af. regardless if you think it was completely her fault or not you cant deny it was def not helpful.
@galadrius the mighty
@jo  then imagine putting what s left of your career on the line for her. yikes.
100 . he tries so hard to act like  the tough guy  in is twatter post and on camera. seriously  my sock drawer is more menacing than him.
@marc pascual  eww lol
@marc pascual  it probably has a higher sperm count too.
yeah. he s one of those people that thinks only your freedom of expression isn t freedom from consequences.
he spoke about killing his family members because they are republican  Imean regardless of one s own politics that is just evil.
@raskolnikov  oh shit really  did he say it on twitter
@eskmilio thunderbunny  lmfao
@emma     yea I remember seeing that clip. he also said something like trump supporters can drink piss or do drink piss. I cant remember the exact quote but what he said about his family was vile and shocking.
he gives me the  should stay at least 500 yards from a school at all times  and  has to knock on your door to let you know he is on a list when he moves in  vibes
@michael bush  oh wow. what a disgrace!
Im shocked thatsessler isn t an actual gamer. it was morgan webb who was the gamer of the duo. sess was just some wannabe actor.
good riddance
its too bad. attack of the show was fun and had a good cast.
I really dont want it to  rest in peace   though.what happened to g4tv  should be trumpeted  often. its as a huge  what  not  to do! if you want to succeed!  moment. it really is a good lesson  for some to learn from.
@yeost  in the words of ben  yahtzee  croshaw  let s all laugh at an industry that never learns anything! tee hee hee!
thank you for always being an important voice on these issues  melony. you are definitely not an outcast and not even a minority on these issues  they persecute us who think differently and make us feel isolated as part of their strategy to take over industries and institutions!
keep the faith melonie and keep up the attitude of gratitude.
unironically quoting will smith s rant from the oscars is my favorite part of this guy s tweet.
definitely feel ya to some degree on being a game industry outcast. I build games though  been at it for a decade  and Ive lost friends and opportunities over my nonconformity. Im still the same person  but Ive restructured my entire life because of this. if I cant build freely in their world  I ll build my own world. ps lookin heckn cute today! stay classy!
its nice to see you sharing your faith. once I saw how based you are I subscribed.
Im really sorry to hear you feel ostracized. if love to see you doing a gaming show and changing the culture around it. similar to what g4 tried to do. we have your back!
keep doing what youre doing... I ll keep watching.  much respect for standing up for your beliefs.  we need more people like you!
let the old saying ring true  the proof is in the pudding.  they made a bad product  then tried to force everyone to eat it even when they said it was bad. your comments were spot on. I am now a subscriber here and a follower on twitter.
usually if youre catching that much flak on twitter  you know youre doing something right.
so Im not religious  but I whole heartedly believe in God  I just found your videos and Im already in love with you  someone whose not afraid to speak there mind and embrace there faith with strength. I applaud you for everything you do   there should be more people like you.
I admire anyone who stands up for their faith and beliefs.  its so refreshing to see.  way to go melonie!
said this on the last vid. none of them deserve sympathy. dont let them wear you down  I dont agree with everything you have to say and Im still here. we love you.
the funny part is that you never said anything about frosk  but he immediately brought her into it  meaning he knows it to be true thatshe was majorly at fault
youre doing a great job. dont let the people of the world convince you that youre the problem. that just means youre probably the solution.  they want you to think like they do or die. its sad  but dont waste sympathy on those that dont want it.
melonie is so cool and mentally stable. just let that girl alone
keep being you  melonie. you seem very genuine and kind  and we ve got your back.
his attack on you got me to subscribe to you. thrilled to find a gamer of faith! God bless you!
you are amazing! never forget that. the only person that can bring you down is yourself. think positive
for all its worth  youre not an outcast to me melonie. keep sharing your faith. keep creating content.  and I ll keep right on watching.
the real gaming community truly loves you  for your takes and tour positive vibe  sadly there are so many people that are so simple to manipulate and attacks everyone  but you must not let them take you down  they will gone due for their actions.
baaah forreal
keep my  our  name out of your mouth  was not created by will smith and people have been saying that for decades. Im trying to see why you just decided to insert will smith here
@bacardIm3  his use of it is the origin of the meme.  no one is quoting their uncle when saying it online.
@bryan woods  very true  its been around for ages but the recent events have revitalized it in current times and made it a global thing.
paraphrase
@bryan woods  no  not true. it just wasn t normal in your neighborhood or culture. me and my family have used this similar phrases for over two decades. its an eastern us urban phrase  real popular in dc  new york  baltimore  philadelphia  etc. hence why he said it.
will smith did not invent that phrase. its an eastern us urban slogan meaning  dont talk about . will smith is from philadelphia.
@xxreaperzeroxx  my neighborhood of the internet   nothing you ve said changes the fact that no one is quoting an urban phrase.  its a meme based on will smith saying it at the oscars.   now  he learned it in the neighborhood  but thats irrelevant to the meme.
@bryan woods  Im trying to say not everyone thatsays  keep    out your mouth  is quoting a meme or will smith  considering Ive used that phrase for over two decades.
@xxreaperzeroxx  dude op is just joking around why are u so fixated on defending the origin of the phrase
@xxreaperzeroxx  so  the fact that the phrase has gained a massive usage ever since will smith said it is just a coincidence   and the fact that the usage here makes no sense unless youre using it as a meme.
@bryan woods  hey bryan  I just wanted to say you should keep xxreaperzeroxx s name out of your mouth. they them knows this phrase in and out.they them knows the intention of the messager. they them knows where its popular in the u.s. and even which particular cities they thems everywhere use it. they them sees you when youre sleeping. they them knows when youre awake. but if you think Im quoting a Christmas song Im not. because Ive been saying that phrase for decades. I know where in the north pole where its common to say this. I know will smith hasn t even been to the north pole bro. I know all theses things that I just have to defend on youtube comment sections because it gives my life purpose. these phrases that go back generations and generations are what makes us who we are. so if you try to slap a will smith label where it doesnt belong. then we ll slap you back in the comments section  kinda like will smith but not!
@mk v2  before youreply all heated  Im just kidding.I would tell you its not wise to take a single phrase someone says and quantify their entire character from it only because its not culturally normal to you. its like me telling you Im put off by you because you said  as all hell  and I think thats a cringy thing to say. people that dont live where you live dont talk like you do  even in the same country.
@bryan woods  you ve never met a black person in your life  huh
@bryan woods  just kidding. Im just making clear that its not a meme  its cultural. and someone saying it doesnt mean they re quoting will smith. which anyone with any sense at all can understand. do with that what you will.
@eggsecuter  I ain t worried about it.
@xxreaperzeroxx  how bold of you to assume Im not.  and  again  irrelevant.  are you going to claim cultural appropriation in lieu of any kind of argument as well
@xxreaperzeroxx  things lost the ability to remain  just cultural  when humans gained the ability to broadcast messages to billions of devices in seconds. thats what some people are failing to understand. its a form of appropriation  but its unstoppable now. cultures influence one another and change in the process. as do languages. you can claim a saying all you want. once it becomes common stock  it loses its exclusivity. doesnt mean the community that coined itstops using it the same way they always did. it just isn t theirs anymore. sorry if that offends some people but its a consequence of globalism for better or worse. I like american chinese food. I know its not authentic and I couldn t care less.
@bryan woods  if youre wrong  and I dont think you are  the other claim that needs to be proven is that the tweet we re discussing is quoting a regional saying instead of the version that has entered pop culture. the pop culture meme version has exponentially more reach. it will influence more people. we all understand that every saying comes from somewhere. I didn t think it was controversial to understand that they lose their exclusivity when they enter pop culture. if you consult a good dictionary with archaic versions of words  you will see that many have lost their original meaning. its because we list definitions by most common use. it used to take tens or hundreds of years for words to change. technology has accelerated the process. just assumed it was common sense that that happens. apparently its a disturbing revelation for some people. so to be clear  we expect them to carry on using sayings the way they always have. will smith  for the record  also used it the eastern united states way. but now it is synonymous with an immature reaction to something. melonie s post was sweet but the guy freaked out on her. thats closer to overreacting to a joke than the original way it was used.
@seedofwonder   k
he was trying to be all ghetto gangster.  it is so sad when lilly white dudes try to act that way.
@bryan woods  its not that deep bro. all I said was saying keep    out your mouth doesnt automatically mean he s quoting will smith. I ll leave it there.
@xxreaperzeroxx  youre right that it isn t that deep.  youre still probably wrong  and youre the one the started it by saying that the quote had nothing to do with will.
why y all having a pissing match over something stupid
@osets 2117  context matters. if the tweet intended us to think of the smith-rock exchange then its a thinly veiled way of saying  you deserve to be slapped for your take on g4.  so its not a pointless topic. people will condemn will smith but then turn around and use extreme language  and sometimes actual violence  on people they dont like. I would rather have melonie as a role model than the woke mob  so I wanted to point out their hypocrisy.
@osets 2117  welcome to the internet
@star-Lord et  true lol
@bacardIm3  is that you frosk
I wanted to like  but you are at the magic number
all one has to do is be reasonable on twitter  and thats enough to make the woke machine rage!   which is why Ive never signed into that toxic pit.
piccolo  let that child alone!!
@brad carver  also piccolo  loses his arm again
thats why they hate her
@brad carver    big green!!!
@deltavagen  lol shows what you care about as a person
you were being so classy and kind too  kinder than I would have ever been. he came after the wrong girl  Imade sure to tell him off and I see many others did as well. there is a reason g4 is out of business  it is because he s right its not just frosk  but people like him as well.
melonie  I haven t been here long but it doesnt take a genius to figure out you are one of the good ones. you shouldn t be the outsider to the industry  you should be the mainstream.
if they dont like your opinion or few then screw them! you are a very kindly and respectful soul  just keep on being you. best wishes mel!
I wish more people would stand up like you do. dont let those idiots get you down. we live in a clown world. its like being stuck in a strange episode of the twilight zone.
I absolutely second your statement on free will.  its not on us to force or make anyone do or believe anything  it up to each individual and must be made by their own agency and not force by others.totally agree with you.
keep fighting the good fight melonie. God is your strength.
they cant help but follow their programming. also kinda funny that the dude hates you so much yet keeps tabs on what you are saying.
keep up the great content. your videos  takes and opinions are just as good as classic lara croft
as soon as I saw this I needed to hear your reaction. you are a class act.
dont let these people get on your head. I been following you since around april or march and been happy to have found you. you have a truly good heart and are a good person. anyone here in the comments can agree with me on that. stay positive and just pray for these people who are just full of hate bcuz they see how happy you are
you are the best mel! keep up the good work!
clearly josh miller has no idea how much effect that one person can have on a brand. keep telling the truth mel!
melonie is a sweetheart. she doesnt deserve that hate.
misery loves company dont let them bring you down to their level continue to be your self and doing what makes you happy
hey  this did something good for ya . it was basically free exposure  your channel grew a bunch from this  didn t it  I know I found you because of it. either way  you seem cool gonna check out more of your stuff!
I agree with your opinion on amaranth as well. streamers have pulled stunts like this for views and money  but without the whole story we dont know if its a real situation or not. there s no point taking one side or the other. and your opinion on a man letting his wife sell herself does mean he loves money more than her. you were spot on
you are nice and spot on in your tweets.  twitter is beyond toxic which is why I dont touch it.
the meltdown has been so funny and crissie putting her nail in the coffin has been fun to watch. I hate thatsome lost their jobs. jirard knew  you could tell by him just sitting there thatshe had just screwed the pooch.
as to you being a villain... no  I think I could give you a pointer or three on that account.its refreshing to see someone like you who is grounded and has a chill vibe who has their stuff together.you give me faith in humanity  again.
I am new to the channel  az named dropped you in one of his recent videos and I had to check it out. melonie  you are such a sweet and optimistic person and you should not have gotten that kind of hate  but you will. dont change who you are  you have my support  be that beacon of light and happiness in these dark times.
yeah... the whole  we were already outdated and dying off before we acted like a bunch of insane babies  gotcha!  doesnt make me feel too owned.
their business model was untenable. that was before the frosk stuff. that big of a staff on a channel with low viewership combined with comcast execs taking their share of money was always a losing business model.so yeah  the frosk simp was actually kind of correct. they were done before they started. still  simping for melanie is lame too. she can defend herself  she s a smart girl.
he s gonna lose his job soon  be more empathetic man!!
@androvsky  good  if this is how he treats others different from him  or those trying to be nice.
sad af
you know its a venomous salty grudge when they lash out at you for wishing them well.
what a baby. melonie didn t even name anyone - just wished good people well.
if enough people call you crazy one may start to believe it and doubt themselves. you are not crazy and we gladly support you  stay strong
yup  once they attack your faith when it is unrelated to the topic at hand is the tell. they are attacking your faith melonie because that is what they are really after! we ve got your back!!
you were being nice. some people are just mean and snarky. and bringing the fact that your a Christian. what does that have to do with it. maybe if he was a Christian too  then maybe he would have a more pleasent demeanor. people should be able to give an opinion without people flying off the handle. men should treat their wife with love and respect. and not a money grab. these people are nuts sometimes. we re her for you melonie. youre the best. we have your back. love ya mel. saty cool. and until the next one!
I just subscribed  my entire group of gamers have been talking about you extremely positive in a myriad of ways. we love you!
heard about you from this broo-ha-ha and just subscribed. glad to hear there s a classy lady who shares my faith talking about nerd subjects!
your post was sweeter than anything the woke crowd deserves.  having Christian values is not a negative.  morals are not a negative.  Im an atheist.
I appreciate you - in my eyes you are a woman of faith. as soon as you mention the man up above the wicked and evil people try to run you through the mud  and because of our faith screw them keep up the great work God has our back - you are not an outcast you belong and you are my favorite gaming news person.
this is absolutely disgusting and should not even be addressed at this stage. .the most these psychos deserve is being forgotten. forever.
youreally cant please some people. you give them well wishes  they will spit in your face or insult you back. they are stuck in misery and there s probably nothing you can do about it other than pray for them hope they become better. its sad.
I couldn t agree more with you about stuff like onlyfans and sex work. while I dont think they should be illegal or anything  it definitely diminishes both the men and women who are involved. its behaviour that hollows out human relationships.
I know itsucks to lose a job and we should feel bad for them .. but they re making it really hard for me to feel bad when they re attacking ppl on twitter
the ratio he got for that tweet was glorious. melonie wins  flawless victory.
youreally are a nice person giving them kindness like that.  but these people keep making it very clear that we re the enemy so I say treat them like one. but you truly are a cinnamon roll.
I came here for the drama and stayed for the mama.
I find your channel extremely comforting in these weird  weird times. people like you  nerdrotic and the likes are like a beacon of hope right now.people out here be acting fr crazy  nice to see people like you with a level head. I love that you are okay with disagreements and dont attack the person. we need more public  figures who act rationally
keep doing what you are doing. dont let the loud minority that gather on twitter to make you question yourself. they are just so far from normal that itseems like you may be off base when you aren t. much respect!
you dont catch flak unless youre over target  keep at it  great content.
the projection is always so telling with these people. you wished the  good eggs  well  and one of the bad ones revealed himself.
obviously  the guy is  bigoted against Christians  but sadly alot of people think thats ok  because Christians  used to do bad things  like demonize harry potter  and stuff... ironically  now who s the people demonizing those things instead
should women also not treat their husband with love and respect
maybe Im old-fashioned  correction  I absolutely am   but thatseriously annoyed me. melonie  you are imperfect  as we all are  but you clearly strive to be a sweet  Godly woman with a good heart. you went out of your way to show kindness to people who were suffering... and you got snake-bit by one of the people you were empathizing with. as a man  I am sorry that happened to you.
one person cant tank a multImillion dollar business!  we all had to work very hard together to tank this business.
thanks melonie for speaking out and sharing your faith!  youre awesome!
you ma am  just got yourself another subscriber. keep up the good work!
dont worry melonie you have people that love here on youtube  we dont have to agee on everything to be buddies.
like my mom always says to me  consider the source dear .  you did nothing wrong other then thinking you were talking about decent people.
stay sweet and keep up your opinions. we love you  Godspeed gurl.
sometimes it feels like Im one of the few non-Christians who actually see and understand what s going on in this psychotic society we currently find ourselves in. dont let them get you down or try to change your faith  keep preaching truth in all forms.
you are the most based gamer I know  never stop sharing your opinions because of losers like josh and amouranth s husband
the fact that you have as much opposition you do proves that youre more than likely on the right track. keep going boom  melonie mac!
and you will be hated by all for my name s sake. but he who endures to the end will be saved.  witness on  sister!
you were nice to the people who deserved it and this guy knowingly felt left out.
melonie  says nice thing wishing well to people who just lost their jobs through no or very little fault of their ownjosh  how dare you say nice things  we are terrible people only say mean things
itsays alot more about them than you mel! keep doing what you do
100  agree with your tweets  if you think frosk didn t contribute to turning the audience away with her  make believe crusade  and think that real love is letting your partner sell the most intimate moments of themselves away to the rest of the world for cash  you ve got some real issues or you were raised wrong.  factz
the hypocrisy with these people is astounding. stand strong  the pendulum will swing back. I never thought as a kid that when I grew up that you would be looked down upon by being a good person.
thats rad yo  home boy on the way out just made you pretty damn on the radar to a lot more people. you seem chill. gonna come up now. congrats on breaking through  this buttnugget probably did it for you unintentionally.
melonie  you are not alone. I just recently found your channel. your look got my attention and your personality will have me coming back. hang in there and ignore the woke nonsense. they represent such a small percentage of the population that their voices are not worth your time. remember everything woke turns to shit.
as a wise man once said  you have to mock  laugh  and ridicule these people
youre smart  you know those that have a bias towards something will vehemently defend it. so dont think twice about any minority of negativity received from the onlyfans take you have. keep doing you
you talking freely about your beliefs and opinions is a huge part of why I follow you.
he probably helped you in the long run since Im sure it brought a lot of eyes to your channel.
your a good person. ur only human and you look and act strong for us all and speak for the real ones. I just wanted to say thank you... and ik all these ppl who talk shit and pile up on you are the bad ones. ik it can get to u off screen but just know you are a strong and good person with good values. shame on these wokies and insane ppl.
your response was very professional. some people  mostly the woke crowd  doesnt understand we are all on this beutiful mudball together. its your channel. Im not a Christian  but I love your channel  and I like the content you put out. tell the wokesters to go back to sleep.  the slept
I agree with pretty much everything you said. appreciate the video melonie!
dont ever change or lower your sweet self to their level melonie
youre not a terrible person. I am older than you and I can say that listening to you has helped and inspired me through some rough spots in my life. dont let anyone get you down  live your best life!  also  I am writing a book tentative title  panic  cancer and other blessings   I would like to send you a copy when im done.     not for a review  not for clout  because I would like your opinion.
youre right about sex work  men not loving their wives if they let them do sex work  etc.youre right  they re wrong. youre at peace  they re full of hate and anger. you speak the truth and support what is right  they support what is evil and depraved. they hate you because you are the opposite to them.Jesus said they hate him and they would hate you  too. they unintentionally prove the words of the one they hate correct by doing exactly what he says they would. God bless  sister!
dont let the insecurities of others  which cant take constructive criticism  seep into you. you aren t going mad  insecure individuals seek solace from escaping reality and will fight with others to maintain their illusions.
subscribed instantly when I saw your black nails and now they are green ! heartbreaking  d anyway keep up the good content  love hearing reasonable woman views about these topics. hugs!
youre definitely better than your haters. I enjoy your perspectives and find you quite charming. keep up the good work.
the fact that they cant even see their own faults in this is unbelievable  going after someone s faith jeez thats a private matter  and Im even agnostic.
if you dont like it  dont watch. mission successful
its always refreshing to see somebody on here who isn t  woke  and crazy. somebody who is still sane lol. people like you are few and far between  so thank you.
youre channel just randomly popped up in my recommendations and I can comfortably say Ive enjoyed and agreed with most of your  views and videos
I support you 100  your tweet was valid  seems like at g4 employees just do it feed the trolls  but in the end the internet always wins but they fail to realize that.
youre a very solid content creator
God is on your side keep it up  we need more people like you to speak their minds
nah mel  youre doing good work. im a long time gamer  ign and gamespot hater  woke hater etc. and to me you are a gamer and I welcome your opinion and your faith  even if I dont share it . they are hurt because you are going against their narrative and ideology they are trying to force on people. like anytime Imake a comment on an issue  im a   phobe  of the discussed category. trying to shut you down with insult and hatred is what they do  even though they are supposedly super inclusive and full of love.
you are doing  great when you are  over the target  and getting  all the flak
they are used to the equation that making something bad big is just as good as making something good  you will have to give them time to adjust to reality since their bubble shattered.
if my girlfriend came to me and said she wanted to start an onlyfans  I would tell her no or Im gone.that is my person who I care for. Im not sharing her with the world in that way.
thanks for bringing your smile again .love you melaniemac go boom!
you may be ostracized from the industry  but not from the important group. the one the entire industry is based upon us fans!keep that chin up!
the first person was like  she didn t say your name  and nobody even knows who you are  lmao
I agree  what frosk did was courageous  talking up on a show along with others  crapping on the fans  and risking alienating the audience possibly leading to the channel dying and everybody getting fired.  ooops.
josh sounds like he got all his boosters and tells his 37 cats about it every day hahaha
melonie   I hope the good eggs can bounce back from  this. joshua   dont pity us. melonie   I said the good eggs  joshua.
he probably chose to go after you because  like any bully  they pick on the people they dont think will hit back
no lie. disperu  you and eric julys voice is like calming. thank you! go boom
your comment was very nice. literally  best of luck  sorry a few bad apples spoiled the bunch  and this person admits they were one of the bad apples by responding like this.oh and he admits he sucked at his job as editor by not edited out that rant that cost them their jobs.
as my best friend would say in this situation   it is what it is . he says that literally about everything
thanks melonie  stay classy. from one brother to a sister
what you said to them was kind  maybe to kind apparently lol. you said nothing wrong melonie. as to joshua well one person named frosk did infact sink a multImillion dollar buisness. so yeah  facts. I do have your back as well as many others who think like you melonie. I hope you are well and God bless.
some people are just mean. thankfully melonie is a genuinely nice person. she s a total catch.
joshua miller sounds like such a nice guy. he should work on a tv show. Im sure he ll attract an audience for checks notes a year.
I would say that after the amouranth blow up it does seem like the husband did abuse her since she s gone full on only fans offering up all the goods right now. Im surprised in the sense thatshe didn t seem like that kind of person but not surprised since she layed it all out there and now youre seeing a hurt person show their change out of damage
I understand your faith issue 100  everytime Ive had a debate with any of these people no matter what we talked about. they say your a Christian and God hates thinks Im a bad person and alll this crap that has nothing to do with it. it honestly pathetic. they argue like kids
their responses tell you everything you need to know about them.
attacking someone based on their faith  lacks all sense of maturity  keep standing by your faith. love your videos  they are very well balanced and entertaining. good day and God bless!
that was a nice tweet  these idiots dont know a good thing even if it hit them in the face  thanks melonie  keep doing your thing.
it is what it is
love that guy
Ive only started to watch you  and I find that I agree with pretty much everything said  if for no other reason then you seem to be grounded  level headed.
at least you were wishing for some of the employees to bounce back melonie
I already got to comment before I realized it was you he was attacking. these people destroy everything while making excuses. him and frosk are great at it. we just did what they told us to do. we started watching people like yourself instead of agenda driven garbage.
itseems like when a guy overreacts like that  its probably because their inaction or mistakes they made were directly responsible for the complete collapse of this project. I think he s processing this shitshow and struggling to cope with itso he lashed out. another reason why I dont have twitter. this type of struggle should be dealt with privately and not for everyone in the world to see.
imagine somebody telling you to keep their names out of your mouth when you didn t name-drop anybody.
you have a good sense about you....dont worry about what crazy and directionless people say about you...
melonie is my favorite person on the internet! the voice of reason in all the madness! lol
as a grown ass agnostic I have no problem with you sharing your faith! continue to be you!
well  I just subscribed - and if any of the g4tv team have had a go at melonie then I know Ive made a good decision.
melonie s face at 9 33 is amazing lmfao
melonie - just keep being you!
in any business situation  seeing yourself as a victim is completely self-defeating.  and when it comes to your career  its an attitude that kills all your options - it can even be the start of a career death spiral.   former ge ceo jack welch.  winning  page 301.
I feel bad for some of the g4 people  the behind the scenes workers mostly. the completionist and gina will both be ok. they seemed like the genuine ones there.  also vanessa guerrero was very pleasant. the other hosts........kick rocks.
I just found you from the quesrterings video! Im so glad I did! so nice to find a smart gamer chick that isn t woke and is also Christian! Im a Christian too! as far as the topic of this video  just remember  Jesus even told us  they hated him because he told the truth no matter how much it angered people  and just as they hated him  they will hate us as well. its just a part of the deal. and obviously we both know why its worth the trouble  glad I found you and glad to be a subscriber!
you can know the truth.  and you can speak.they just dont want you speaking the truth.
you rock melonie! keep speaking that lovely heart  od
with a name like frost  would have thought she d be less in her feelings  never knew of this person  but damn that rant was cringe and the dudes co-signing on it  could have at least opened it up to the chat  but she just dumped on everyone without a chance to get feedback
I love tuning into every video and waiting for the  let s dive in
they re just proving again that none of them deserve any sympathy for the consequences of their own actions
I love this woman. outspoken and knowledgeable about her faith  recognizes when race swaps or gender swaps is trash writing  a gamer  and generally seems like an intelligent sweet person. she is a steelers fan  but hey no one is perfect. could be worse  she could have been an eagles fan
they re just jealous because they re jobless sharing ramen with their six cats and six roommates
I know how you feel with the outcast thing  my whole friend group is almost all liberals and Im the only conservative. I engage with one of them all the time and point out his bs which ironically has made me and him more friends. friends can disagree and thats what people dont understand. I had a argument with one of them  a hispanic guy  on the george floyd stuff and he got so upset and said its because it impacts him a lot  but Im the black one lmao.
worked just as well for him as it did for will smith
thanks to that guy I found your channel so kudos to him.
what frosk did was courageous   Im dead
talking about the adam sessler tweet about mississippI  as someone that has lived in mississippImy whole life  I will agree with you melonie that people in general are pretty happy in mississippi. Ive known many people who hate living in mississippI  I dont necessarily love mississippI either  but despite the amount of people Ive known that hate mississippI  I feel like there s more people here that re happy and like living here than those that hate it and are unhappy. a lot of people that live further up north or in bigger cities actually like to live in places like mississippI when they retire cause its not a place like california or new york with all these big cities. its all very easy going  slow paced  and not as hectic feeling because there s not many big  popular cities.
keep our names out of your mouth  rational folks rarely  if ever  begin a statement by channeling their inner will smith.
dont let it bother you kiddo  those crazies irrationally hate anyone who remotely claims Christianity.  just keep doing what you think is right and dont worry about those nut jobs.  also  was great seeing you in tnme. hope you had fun.
melonie has like the perfect personality to look for in a girl.
stand firm. I stand with you too. this whole thing is just bonkers.
from the gaming space  I fully agree and understand how and why you feel alienated ...but we arent alone
you have earned a new subscriber. well done.
until recently  I was very much holding myself to a higher standard in talking with other communities that have individuals who disagree with a lot of my positions. they would spout whatever they wanted and I thought I needed to hold my tongue  because I dont like conflict  Im amiable and I d rather not ruin the relationships I had.one week I was very stressed and this reached a breaking point where I felt I just shouldn t be in the community anymore. so I left.I talked to a friend about it and she asked me   if they will not accept you for who you are regardless of your opinions  is that really a relationship you want to have  one where you constantly restrain yourself  your opinion is just as valid as theirs and if they cant accept you despite your differences then you should pursue that friendship. she was right. so I went back to the discord and we discussed stuff. they didn t outcast me for differing opinions but I had worried with the current cultural climate they would. people like my friend  like jeremy and like melonie remind me I cant live my life in fear anymore  that being true to yourself is something all people should do.so dont ever be scared that you are alone in your thoughts. seek validation only from God. people that are right for you will gravitate to your authenticity and you will cultivate a community with good values in being true to your beliefs.
youre an idiot if you think a single person cantank a multImillion dollar business.  then I guess Im an idiot  because that is exactly what happened. frosk told people not to watch   they listened. and then to make matters worse  the company back her up. its kind of hard to keep a show channel running if nobody is watching. peace!!!
the reason those lack luster kinda people go after are faith is cuz they re being influenced by the other side thus they feel threatened and vengeful towards us but who cares  those people flip flop at the drop of hat  a truly sad existence they live
something tells me that man would never speak to you like that on the street  imagine attacking some one who is sympathetic to your situation.
damn girl... you are astonishingly beautiful and I cannot believe you are 35 as you act and look so young!you take the hits and keep doing what you do... go boom!
spreading the gospel and standing up for what is right can never be wrong.  there are very few young Christians willing to stand on the word of God  but you do and that is a great thing.  may God continue to bless you  and give you the strength needed to be a bright light in our dark world.
meloniedidnothingwrongthe eating a stick of butter thing was weird though.boom
Im sure Im revealing my advanced age here  but we used to have an expression for folks like him. they walk around with a chip on their shoulder.
sometimes when people want to self-destruct its best to just let them and stay out of the blast radius.
the quotes replies in her tweet thread are straight up comedy gold.
thank you a lot.  melonie. I cannot compare my experience to yours and certainly not in that degree. but its good to know what not all people in the industry feel like Im an evil and igorant person just for believing in God  I trully wish you blessings
I d like to thank everyone who added to that ratio.  his tweets are protected now after being smacked down so hard.
this josh person still backed frosk well  he clearly wasn t the people you were referring to when you said  good eggs  lol
melonie is forgetting the ancient proverb  always be nice to your enemy... it pisses them off.
melonie keep doin ur thing girl  just know  these  people are a minority. there are alot of us that think like you on issues like this. we are all entitled our opinion  as it is said how are we suppose to grow if we dont have civil discourse through our opnions.
evil  you are probably the most wholesome streamer that I watch and its just fine with me  I enjoy your content.  a lady being classy is definitely missing in society so its nice to see. your attitude is refreshing af. haters gon  hate
melonie fans   he started monologuing  melonie   he started monologuing!!! he started this prepared speech of how feeble I am compared to him  how inevitable my defeat is  how the world will soon be his  yadda  yadda  yadda.
babe  you just had your  chris rock  moment ... also showing goodwill to those lunatics was a bad idea  you dont have to laugh at their self-inflicted misery but you dont have to try to be nice with them either  not worth it xd
new video! Im here for it
stay strong  your normal in a abnormal world
melonie keep up the good work. I really enjoy your views
take strength in your faith  these things are sent to try us.
noticed the jump in subs.  jeremy at thequartering covered this interaction.  milk it for all its worth  mel.  you deserve it.
youre dont deserve their toxicity  they re just butthurt after losing their jobs but it doesnt give them the right to disrespect you like this because they down talk their core audience   failed to take accountability for it
Im not even on twitter  I just saw someone else covering this twitter post and wondered if you were gonna do a video. lol
you are enduring a tremendous hardship. you are daniel in the lion s den  but you will survive. God bless you.
gonna write a book probably but tldr  you did nothing wrong and your original tweet was very sweet. I dont think they can be happy  they thrive on negativity. they think twitter is  their  platform and when someone goes against their narrative  they implode. what the guy did in his reply isn t acceptable but it is one of their tactics to go after one s faith. I know you dont condone going after someone  something they wouldn t hesitate to when their hive mind perspective is questioned  but if I were on twitter more  I d definitely go in on him. in fact I really questioned whether or not I should get briefly back on to poke fun at adam sessler since he was passing out 3rd grade  mom  comebacks and wanting to fight people too. youre a very sweet and outspoken woman who seems very strong in her faith. thatscares them. a lot. not to be hyperbolic but it does seem to be their antithesis. while Imight not be the most traditionally religious person I will say  remember your armor of God in these time and it will get you through these difficult times. youre a wonderful person  dont let their words tear you down. I think youre doing a great job bringing up valid points! stay strong and most importantly you got this!!!
I said the exact same thing about the situation with amouranth and her husband on the news break app and got attacked in the comments too in the same way. lol people are just dumb and you cant let it bother you.
its not even about having your back which we did of course  his tweet was clownish af....we re not idiots sir...we are aware one person doesnt cause the complete downfall of a company.  your tweet seemed respectful to me....that guy came to twitter mad already is my guess.
he s that guy that doesnt know when someone pees in your wheaties  you dont have to keep eating them.
they re just salty their network sucked.
there are so many different paths in life. to say someone cant love another  in a situation you have never experienced seems a bit judgemental imo. its good to have an opinion  and it doesnt have to be right. you just need to be humble enough to realize you dont know everything  and try to see things from other points of view. try to not take the hate personally  its not about you its about themselves
well he s correct in way  one person cannot single-handedly bring down a major company. it needs the whole team to jump on board and cheer as the ship goes down! and they call us idiots
mel   sorry to all the good peeps that got burned by one crazy woman s destructive rant frosk simp   nah  fuck you  fork is queen  dont need your pity! like  dude  ease up  frosk ain t gonna sleep with you.
youre a good dude  keep on abiding
these people dont want sympathy  they want to be victims so they can continue to accumulate pity points.
joshua miller made his twitter account private and deleted some of the tweets like one calling all the people replying to his tweet jan 6 insurrectionists  what a clown . he s backpedalling hard now though  huge l for him.
I never watched g4tv. just saw frosk s meltdown and a few other highlights. they seem really hostile though  Im surprised they got so big.
exactly how things went for me.  we Christians should be nicer than that  guys! ...time passes... ohhhh. thats why.
what you typed was fine... kind... and true!what do they call these people...  snowflakes !
frosk  miller  and sessler are like chief wiggum  homer  and otto at the bottom of a deep hole they had dug  the hole being g4 tv   and they re trying to dig their way out by  dig up  stupid !
the fall of g4 can be directly connected to frosk  but sure a single person cant tank a company.  in a way  he s right.  it also took management to back her up and think attacking your fanbase is going to work out for you.
screenshots are forever.
how...how much hate can all these people have  like I can be an old grumpy asshole at times but even I think someone needs to hug these people...feels like they forgot what love is...
I know nothing about mel but I saw 1 of her vids like 3 weeks ago and became a sub  plus she s pretty while being level headed.
they dont get to say  keep our names out of your mouth  after they made a massive public spectacle of themselves.
twitter has lots of people who are absolutely toxic. people will attack you for next to no reason on there. so try not to take it to heart. it is hard not to sometimes  but you have way more supporters than attackers
I can only imagine how much he hates himself and how far down in the delusional ocean he has sunk.
disgusting to see the level of hate people are willing to throw at Christians for simply existing nowdays. it is disgraceful and they should have a good look at the mirror before venting. all you did was say a positive thing about a bad situation  there was no negative connotation whatsoever
melonie s hair so on point twitter mob had to come for her  they just cant compete.
truthfully  I dont watch your channel all that much. but  I have the exact same amouranth take. Im glad there are still sane ladies out there.
melonie   hope the g4 people bounce back. josh   I hate you! I hate you! reeeeeeeeeeee!!! gee  I wonder how that network ever managed to implode so quickly with such level-headed people there.
dont ever apologize for your beliefs thanks for standing up
75k subs now noice ! keep it up melhmmm...I thought your comment was pretty nice actually. you have to be really leaning far psycho and your life needs to be an open nerve to be thatsensitive to what you said.  itshows there s just something terribly wrong with these people. working with them or living with them must be a nightmare.ps  yeah thats the first thing they do is go after a person s faith. especially if they are any Christian denomination. they d never slag a muslim  buddhist or some wiccan only slag Christianity because they are hollow and sad people inside utterly devoid of their own faith in any higher powers unless its like karl marx maybe
attacking you for being a Christian is not acceptable in any context. joshua miller should be utterly ashamed of himselfyour tweet was compassionate and professional. this is to be commended. by contrast he was petty  vicious and discrimatory.for the record  the religious  political  social beliefs and opinions you express are pretty moderate. anyone trying to portray or make you feel like some extremist nut job is out of line.
some of the ex employees are bitter. I wouldn t even take it personal. there were some good people there indeed  mixed in with the...others. I dont think frosk sunk the ship on her own but I think she poked one of the biggest holes in it almost from the jump. g4 got a second chance and it could have been great but they squandered it.
melanie mac is one of the nicest people on the net. being mean to her is like kicking a puppy.
melonie you didn t say anything wrong. this dude was all in on frosk until it cost him his livelihood. and now he s lashing out  even at people wishing him and the other staff who got fired well. thing is frosk doesnt care about anybody. tomorrow she wont remember the names of half the people she worked with. and if he still wants to ride with her so be it  he s just gonna do it from the unemployment line.
something you should think about regarding feeling ostracized from the gaming industry is that the typical person has no interaction with it at all apart from just consuming products. it might be unusual for you  but the average person has probably never experienced any different. at least you had that opportunity at one point. just a perspective thing for you to consider  not a jab or a criticism.
the comment you made about feeling like youre going crazy reminds me of the mugatu line from zoolander. I feel like Im taking crazy pills lol. I definitely relate
keep our names out of your mouth yeah saying that really worked out for will smith too.
I wonder if he s quibbling about how much responsibility frosk had for the downfall of g4tv  or if he actually thinks she had zero responsibility for it...
the truth is all we have  without it we damn ourselves.
before today I had never heard of either you  melonie  or that miller guy. as it is  Im having a beer enjoying your content  and chuckling and snickering at buzzfeed barry. go woke  go derp. cheers!
as my father would say  keep the faith come what may .
lmao he s salty  got yourself a new sub hearing this news.
your faith is inspiring  dont be discouraged by true woke mob  stay strong in the Lord
either they are trolls  not employees  or they are in pain.
s  I agree
his reaction to you got me to subscribe to your channel.  teamJesus
hell hath no fury like a g4tv employee scorned.
he then went on a blocking spree when people called him out on his latest tweet. said tweet was where he played the victim claiming quartering fans were harassing him cause of his  support  for frosk... support   the tweet in this video... xd
I wish I could peer into the alternate reality where frosk never went on that unhinged rant. I wonder what things are like there.
amen sister.your video  from not too long ago about your faith is why I subscribed to your channel.peace.
Im all for having a discussion and being able to have different viewpoints. does seem like some people dont want anyone else to have an opinion on certain topics unless it agrees with them.
I usually do not comment. I hate having pointless keyboard arguments with angry or just plain stupid humans. I do want to tell you  I do not share your religious beliefs or gender  probably a lot of differences. however  I believe your response was very generous. unfortunately misery loves company. I look forward to more videos and your point of view. our different points of view are that which makes us individuals. youre great  go boom!
the reason they went after you so hard was because of the Christian cross in your twitter name.Imean  their words make that case better than any political argument I could make.
he must lash out  because accepting her compassion would make him an enemy in the eyes of all his woke  allies   thus cancelled and figuratively hunt down like a rabbit.
some other youtubers reported on this. its disgusting the way he treated you  and attacking your faith too  shows how narrow minded he actually is.
he tried to will smith mac.  keep our names out your fm ing mouth!  going after a cute girl is the best way to look like a chad-bro. good job  dude.
about the only fans  models  getting mad  the truth hurts. hit the nail on the head that they care more about money  and they got big mad.
melonie you are awesome  im a Christian too and 100  agree with you keep being your awesome self   we got your back
I just wanted to tell you melonie that I am so sorry that the g4 employees snap at you. anyway thats not a nice thing to do for a great and lovely young lady that you are and I do hope you can find something that you can snap at them back for having them snap at you  ok melonie. anyway I just wanted to tell you that and I just wanted to tell you that I am so sorry that g4 employees snap at you  ok melonie. anyway keep it up and do good of making great videos like this video  ok melonie. anyway have a great day and week and weekend melonie.
hImelonie. new sub. jeremy from the quartering sent me. he s right. you are the best and kind. keep up the great work.
dont get mad at melonie  save the salt for frosk.
you are super cool mel keep it up!!
try to put more faith in those who look after each other instead of those who look after themselves and gloat about their survival from the fires they started.
he said one person cant tank a multImillion dollar company.  he s right.  frosk didn t do it herself  adam helped.
I once heard in a sermon that wokeness is a religion without grace...so true.
tag team finishing move baby!
I didn t know that about the wokies  hating Christians Imean. Im an athiest I suppose  halfway to agnostic anyway  but I wouldn t put people down for their faith  they re usually good hearted people anyway. I hate how they treat everyone they think is wrong  ironically almost everything they say applies more to them than anyone else. awesome video  stick to your core values and you wont go wrong!
he doesnt want the amazing people who worked at g4tv to be better and more successful in contrast. people like him are bitter and despise those they hate to be blessed.
josh protected his tweets lmao
that was hilariously unreal.
not one person said take it easy  will  and im kinda sad about it... haha
okay  this is what jeremy at thequartering was talking about!melonie  all I can say is that these people who are so  all in  with their woke-postmodern-social engineering-intersectional- diverse and inclusive  stuff are in general very unhappy  clearly  because they work themselves up that badly over their politics.  and if even one person disagrees with them  they ll flip out and brand that person as an enemy and call them names.  and cancel them.  and other worse things.  activism in current year is basically children throwing a tantrum even when they re treated nice  and joshua is representative of that.I think by your saying we all saw this coming -- ahem  we all did because  get woke  go broke  is a truism! -- that might have been triggering enough for joshua.  thats still no damn excuse to call you an idiot  and I have to wonder what the blazes your faith has to do with this  especially since you never mentioned it     heck  they give chris pratt all kinds of crap just because he s religious.Ive got your back too  melonie  and Im just ignoring fired morons like joshua!
lol good job. this is how you know youre doing the right thing  when they cry on twitter. what do you mean you weren t mean  these people think everything is mean! just talking about them is mean.
your not alone sister. Im a practicing Christian and I agree with where you stand @melanie mac go boom
you seem to be doing fine  from where Im at.that josh dude - well  being  big mad  at someone who s criticized your place of business  yet has been shown to not a total hardass by empathizing with the recently terminated  is cause for introspection  dude.
he basically said  shut up your a Christian classy
Im here because az and jeremy told me to be here! cant wait to watch more.
dont hold back on attacking them   they are on twitter to argue   you cantell by their tweets they want to cause outrage and controversy because they want attention
keeps our names out of your mouths  I guess somebody s learning from will smith.
mel  you are just so sweet!
quartering sent me. you are awesome and surprised I haven t found you. anyway  u got my support!
its startling to me how companies like g4tv and many of their ilk think that attacking the people who pay their bills will make them more money. do they think that hate lasts forever or something  and that people gravitate towards company s that hate them. it makes no sense. love lasts forever  even when it comes to couples that go through divorce  there is still a small portion of them  for the rest of their life  thatstill loves that person. hate is short-lived  but leaves heavy scars. people dont forget those who wronged them. its why revenge has been known since ancient times and was always said to be looked past. to let bygones be bygones. however  those who do let the hate subside  they always  without a doubt  never want to see those who wronged them again. it is as simple as that and any first year psychology student could tell you that.
keep our names out of your mouth! ok will smith.
keeping you melonie  haters are going to hate
sarcastic tone  how dare you go after the wokies  melonie
omg I never seen somebody this angry before... why was he attacking you when you were telling the truth...
I sleep better at night when g4tv keeps crying.
its disgusting that these people cant even handle the most tame responses if they re in disagreement.
melonie  I think you are blessed  not an outcast.
because he would be celebrating an  enemy  getting canceled he thinks thats what you are doing  and maybe the facts hurt him because he is a part of what brought g4tv down.
you cant be nice to these people. better to let them bludgeon themselves with their own toxic idiocy
outro music is fitting nothing wrong with your tweet.  some people are just assh les.  you keep being you and dont let anyone change you.  God bless.
thats what they do  shame  guilt and insults and the need to be right. -kevin samuels
well said. as a lapsed-Christian fan of the catholic jrr tolkien I have recently only been able to truly understand his writing by going back to the role his faith played in its creation. it was hidden by him  but it was there. I am left  but woke is crap. it is a shield to hide behind in order to discriminate. keep doin  what your doin   -
Imean he s right. one person cant tank a business. but a network standing with one person  could absolutely tank a business.
you are becoming one of my favorites
this is what you do when these people yell at you hook them up to plow and farm them.
ex g4tv employee  youre full of venom!the 268 people who commented back in response  have you tried a mirror!
just a comment to support the channel!too bad thatsome people dont have a channel anymore.
melonie as an atheist centrist who could give a shit about politics I feel ostracized from the gaming community and so many other nerd and geek communities due to this bullshitso I completely understand I feel ya
just had to resubscribe  melonie. was wondering why I didn t see this from your channel. youtube still doing shady shit.
miller is clearly not one of the  good eggs . I tweeted that I felt sympathy for him learning about his job loss via twitter until he made that tweet. I also agreed that multiple people were responsible for g4tv failing through poor management  hiring practices and spiteful attitudes. he did of course block me.
g4tv is the best get woke go broke situation yet !!!
we love you mel!
I cant believe employees at g4 thought this job was sustainable. they must of known this ship was sinking.
yeah they re ratings drop that happened immediately after she said that proves that her   courageous woke b         is what destroyed any chance that that company would succeed and the fact that g4 backed her sealed the deal for normal people to want to watch their channel any longer
keep up the good fight!
my man saw will smith and said   he s sane and rational. I should emulate him
God bless you  and I hope God helps you prospers.
I couldn t be with someone who had an onlyfans or anything similar. that whole dynamic is just weird. couldn t agree more.
must...protect...the...message...at...all...costs!
well  I would say that josh was half correct. there were a number of factors why g4 went down. such as people not caring about it anymore. frosk was just a convenient excuse  because she happens to be a toxic person.to say what she did was  stunning and brave   was hilarious though. considering she was literally the last person to get fired. and then bragged about outliving everyone else.
sounds like you broke a bad egg with a nicer tweet than Ive seen.
no. youre not crazy. you make a perfectly reasonable comment thats true and makes sense and people who are angry  bored or both try to take it as an insult so they can be victimized. this whole g4 thing is just next level ridiculous.
you are not an outcast. you have your faith so remember in the end  God loves you and thats what matters in the end. we have your back! God bless!
just followed you on twitter. I cant believe I never did.
I saw san fransisco in 2006  when it had pooped the bed a little  but overall people saw it as still cute and kitschy and neat and such. bush man is a legend. but man  that place is a nightmare now. Im glad I got to see what the fuss was about before it got wiped away forever.
these people literally treat well wishes as an insult how sad
God bless...good job!...there will be many fiery arrows. never give up!
tbh I dont know of you and only know of frosk because of the viral rant and whatever follow up videos ive randomly seen of her and sessler on twitter  this is your first video Ive ever seen and Im willing to bet if you were on g4 instead of frosk they wouldn t have tanked...its almost like most of these tv personalities aren t vetted at all anymore because those ppl up front and center in that company seem to be complete aholes in general..if it was a viewer vote basis between all of you based on what I just seen of you and what I seen of that whole cast who s job was to be on tv in the lights you d win hands down against any of them based on the way you conduct yourself alone  I think these companies need to be more careful with who they re hiring because clearly they had agendas to begin with higher on their priority list than just getting content to fellow gamers..pretty sure I read that was in frosks deal thatshe would get to rant about misogyny when they hired her...they need to get their priorities straight
good job!
joshua miller is a perfect example of  these people cant learn.   first  he s invoking will smith and his career-ending tirade   not a good look to start with.  second  he s essentially proving the point he s arguing against.  if anything  he s saying   you give us too much credit  we re all as bad as frosk and we all contributed to this   !  show crashing and burning.
Imean im insane but youre still right most of the time
Ive never met another sister on the same wave length. Im surprised twitch hasn t banned you yet. .... they banned me and I was a tiny streamer.
keep doing ur thing hun. u r a soldier in the culture war and I can only speak for myself but Im on ur side. Im not religious but I think Christian values are important  especially today.
I typically like to put you on and listen in the background but I just started the video and noticed the small dog walking out of the room like  nope. not dealing with this topic  and now I find myself staring at the flock of wandering small pups in the background. I promise to rewind and listen but I had to pause to write this as I haven t heard a word you ve just said. lol sorry. also love the hair.
dude Im 40 years old and forgot g4 was even a thing. if that panel would have stood up and told frost to shut up. her rant that got them shut down and  abandoned would have been reinforced to dismiss and remove her. then people like me would have cam back to g4 with strong support. however that chose poorly and kept quiet and clapped like seals in a circus. spineless cowards fall with her.
5 39 thats called totalitarianism and its dangerous. btw I like your new hairstyle
unpopular opinion  I thought frosk was right. however - its important for me to hear your thoughts on the matter and consider more views. keep up the good work and thank you for sharing!
you should reply to that guy with the  I survived  meme that frosk used.
he s just upset that he had to look at frosk instead of sara jean underwood.
I admire you for sharing your faith. I try to do the same with the people around me. but there are so many people who think being Christian means being everyone s doormat. Christ wasn t a doormat when he came the first time - and he s not going to be when he returns. he s going to come with a sword. so fear not  melonie  there are millions of us on your side.
looks like Imay have to reactivate my twitter I apparently am missing loads of fun
coming from a woke person  that wasn t mean at all  it was almost a declaration of love!!!
I doubt many people are in the  hive mind   they re just doing what the job demands and either keeping their yaps shut or nodding when appropriate. its food on the table or all the way out. thats what makes itso dispicable is how unneccesary that is for a gaming channel and how they reward people for messaging and fake pats on the back. its like a cult by paycheck.
one person literally tanked a whole cooperation  that is exactly what happened  she literally fucked around and found out. so the community said  ight and dipped on g4. so yeh
if youre attacking someone for their faith you already have lost the moral high ground
my life got better once I got off twitter
this is exactly why I dont feel sorry for any of those iosers.  I would just quote the joker when he said   you get what you f----- deserve!
his tweets are now protected.  poor joshy-poo couldn t handle the heat.
thank you for being normal
dont worry joshua  Im sure no one meant you when talking about  good eggs .
your onlyfans comment was spot on.
was more than just that one chick s rant that ended the  new g4 . their content and writing in general sucked. even small and medium streamers on twitch were doing better content.  josh s reaction just proved he didn t understand why they went under.
I agree I think all normal gamers feel like outcasts in the gaming space because all the woke shit is starting to get into this industry too - should be a space where all are welcome to enjoy games etc together
well  I think  usually you are on the point but on sex work  it will happen anyway so I would say it is better on stream then on the streets safer for everyone.not connected to the topics in any way tho. great channel!
you never mentioned frosk in your post. so how did mrs. miller know who you were referring to   that goes to show their level of delusion and bs. deep down they know who the culprit is and the one main responsible for the collapse of the channel. also agree with the amouranth take. no way a real man  husband  would be okay with that.
talk to  em frosk!
Im pretty sure amouranth made up the whole thing about an abusive husband. she s probably rolling in dough from all her simps after that.
from hell s heart  I stab at thee  - ancient klingon proverb.
how have I not found this channel until now got you a new sub
watching the wokies become the brokies is like watching the sunrise over the sahara. one of the most beautiful sights one can witness.
so jeremy did a video on this and I decided to watch your videos first and when I went to his channel just now its gone    I wonder what happened.
he was right about one thing - they deserve no sympathy. I only came across your channel recently and I didn t know you were a Christian but after seeing this unprovoked hatred against you  you have my sub   support! stand tall   speak your mind!
3 people from g4 that I actually respect and actually like are gina  will neff and austin
host for gamestop tv   does that mean the tvs that were constantly playing clips of games coming out and talking about them like it was a news program. that was what you were on   cause I only came across this channel like two weeks ago and I swear your voice and even look seem very familiar to me. I was gonna ask where I know her from but I didn t think anywhere and thought that would come off weirdanyways good luck. great channelplease dont be disheartened at weirdos or ignorant people calling you a bad person. just remember the ancient quote   preach the truth to a fool and they will call you a fool  its just the way it goes. if you have a differing opinion from most of these weirdos its probably a sign your doing something right
ty for standing up for what is right as its not easy to do nowadays. freedom of speech is under assault in unprecedented ways so nice to see there are people still willing to believe in a free opinion.
still woke  not broke.
pay no mind to the endlessly hateful card carrying lefties. God bless you for spreading the word  and for making fun content .
your twitter has been gold the last few weeks.
didn t he throw his family under the bus and now he s using them to make sad time
@melonie mac go boom  hey  hope youre having a wonderful day! just wanted to pop in and say  about this g4tv stuff  let s be real  joshua miller and adam sessler are just mad youre hotter than frosk is. and yeah  I know  its probably misogynist of me to say that  amirite  sarcasmbut for real  frosk is the reason that g4tv was sunk faster than titanic  okay  now  they had their own part to play in that drama  but frosk was the one who had the gas can and the blowtorch in hand  when she went on that rant. because everybody who is in media knows the unwritten rule  give the people what they want. you  the quartering  every channel I know of thats successful does this. but frosk and the leadership at g4tv  annhilated that rule in favor of breaking the law of best intentions  as well as  go woke  get broke.  the law of best intentions  by the way  is this rule of life  that the best of intentions can and will lead to the worst of consequences  up to and including death. and this most certainly applies  because frosk  rather than appearing to be some woke sjw crazy feminist  the only thing missing was the colored hair  imo   could have approached this issue in a much more  tolerant  fashion  let s say  instead of telling the viewership   if you dont like it  dont watch.  that is literally telling the very people who would sustain g4tv that their patronage isn t wanted or needed. if that happened in any other space  such as any brick and mortar store  the same result would happen  except the owner of the store would have all sorts of community backlash about it  and nobody would stand up for them doing what they did. and frosk  joshua miller  and adam sessler all get the  shocked pikachu face  when everybody quits watching  they cant say that what happened wasn t to be expected  because if they truly thought that what actually happened wasn t going to happen  then g4tv deserved its sad fate  because obviously  the people who tried to resurrect the brand  had no freaking clue about what they were doing. and thats the truth of the matter.but as for your tweet  it  imo  was not at all vile or full of hate in any way  shape  or form. so you have nothing to worry about there. but as for your question  no -- I dont think anyone who supported frosk or g4tv at the end  let alone in the gaming community  will learn the lesson staring them in the face  that if you want to succeed  give the people what they want  rather than violate the law of best intentions or tell your customer base you dont want their business. because as itstands  g4tv is the poster child of what not to do  when you run a business. sorry to rant  but I said what I needed to say. hope you have a wonderful day  melonie!
are the crazy tattoo sleeves part of the veneer   honestly I thought he was talking about somebody else.
I dont subscribe often unless I feel compelled to for personal reasons. being an unapologetically Christian gamer. you got it!
dunno how jeremy from the quartering didn t send me your way yet  I just found you and Im loving your videos lol plus youre gorgeous.so  funny  cute  smart  good subject matter plus video games  plus pissing off liberals  dude its the perfect channel!!!!!! lol
oh well just keep it moving moving mel!
how is that even their reply to well wishes. what the heck.
you may  feel  like an outcast  but there are some of us that get hit with perma-bans left  right  and center  simply for attempting to speak our minds. and are  actually actively cast out . so yeah  it could be a lot worse.
this would be like chris rock getting mad at people for not liking will smiths slap. so confusing.
continue to be a good
I put in my two cents on twitter before your video. bigotry is not okay. you are not alone. you are in the majority. the woke hivemind doesnt exist outside big cities and corporations.
dont back down when the mob reeeee at you  thats exactly why they pile up on people in the first place.
with respect to mr miller  yes  ms black did almost single-handedly tank g4tv  no matter how much he awkwardly wants to white knight. the seal clapping from other g4 hosts and employees certainly didn t help the death spiral  but it was black who put the network into that death spiral in the first place.
these people really do not want to admit that the kind of bullshit frosk stands for  is a guranteed l  because they know what that means for them  more l s.
lololol this is the best comment on that tweet   keep our names out of your mouth.  I dont recall her saying your name. granted no one has any idea who you are. so there s that.
the first person thats always capable of tanking a company is the ceo. everyone else is secondary.
they re just mad cause you are making money  and they...are fired.  lol
fanatics only want to acknowledge two types of people  the ones who totally agree with them  aka  us   and the ones who dont agree with them  aka  them  or  the enemy . they refuse to see gradients because they only think in absolutes.
the mac attack didn t even dropped the  boom!  and he got so triggered ... this person s world would be utterly destroy if air mac dropped the boom on him.
2 33  he seriously went will smith on you  xd
Imean  they made a video-game channel hosted entirely by npcs  with no protagonist.  not sure what they expected to happen.  joking aside.....the sad part is  the only way something like this could happen....get funded  written  produced and aired....is if basically everyone involved was inside the same echo chamber.  I dont think they had any idea there would even be backlash  because they have fully lost the ability to understand that a decent human being could hold a viewpoint that wasn t the same as theirs.  they ve never even bothered to listen to the reasoning behind any opposing view because they have always just shouted it down  so the only reason they can conceive of for opposition is that anyone who disagrees must just be horrible  hateful  evil people.  they truly believe they are the arbiters of morality.
stay nice  it makes them look even worse.
there s a lot of mixed emotions layoffs is a huge thing at the moment in the economy not just g4 but rooster has been laying people off too. its not cool people are loosing jobs regardless of how you feel. spread more peace people
some of the staff like frosk hate context xd
so he confirmed he was not a good egg
6 20 unequivocally based and true.
way to overreact jason  I didn t even have your name in my mouth. reread my tweet  I said good eggs.
if no one else says it to you melonie I will. amen! we should all be allowed to express our faith and not be attacked for it  and I say that as a person who has been attacked for my faith as well. a few years ago this guy was reviewing a television show that had aired for one season from 1979-1980.  as we all know  values were different back then and you cant review classic programs and apply today s lack of moral values to those shows.he said something that was very out of line and I corrected him in the comments and of course he came after me b c of my faith  and just recently I found out that he went after me on twitter as well - and I dont even have a twitter account! not only that  I found out that one of the guys who had co-interviewed me for his friend s podcast said some nasty things about me as well.  that podcast was taken down a long time ago and it broke my heart. it was about two and a half hours long and my mother sat at my computer and listened to the whole thing. now thatshe s gone it hurts that they took it down.  anyway  stay strong in your faith and dont let those people get you down.
I didn t know any of the g4 people until the company closed its doors. honestly I wondered why so many youtubers  gamers  influencers  etc were celebrating them getting fired. now  after seeing what miserable  angry  hostile  vile people they are  I get it. the entire g4 team is just insufferable. didn t their parents teach them any manners
I like what you ve said here but I still dont like you.  is a hard opinion to ratio and share.
saw this on the quartering  subscribed
I watched one of your older videos and you mentioned your age in it   I was in disbelief. I thought you were early to mid 20s
to quote an anonymous cartoon vampire from australia   gentlemen  if your girl has an of account then she s not your girl. she s everyone s girl .the light of truth offends the mind s eyes of those who dwell in the darkness of lies. its like scripture  they will be offended when yourefuse to partake in their sins
he s right about it doesnt take 1 person cuz it was foreskin and susler who both combined took down the company.
I thought I was the only one  who said wokies haha
flak is the heaviest when youre on target.
melonie dont let them bring you down they are just mad cuz they messed up and they know it.
nothing wrong with stating an opinion. it just tells what kind of person you are. nothing wrong with stating your opinion on someone else s opinion. again  it just states what kind of person you are. act accordingly.if someone loses their mind over your gracious opinion...well...now you know what kind of person that is.
these are the  participation trophy  crowd.  everything they feel  say and do has to be praised  and never criticized in any way.  any criticism and they see red and start swinging.
if they attack you personally  it means they have not a single argument left.  margaret thatcher
what you said was pretty benign relatively harmless....his response was clearly a defense of frosk who you didn t mention by name and yes itseemed like dude was waiting for an opportunity to attack your faith probably for awhile. which is pretty pathetic.
thats why they are so bitter. Godless heathens. keep the faith
crazy to me at the hypocrisy of  respect all women and stop being toxic to them  unless of course they dont agree with you or your politics.
the flak is heaviest when youre over the target
he s got protected account what a mark
6 25 as someone with context of the situation and how he s threatened her animals and to take funds away etc this is completely right lol. he sounds like he s fucking pimping his wife and like he doesnt care about her at all. how is selling your girls body...not seen as bad
keep my name out your mouth  them fighting words where Im from.
beware all who would go after melonie. she go boom!you still have your crew  aye aye captain.
I use to live in san francisco and Imoved to texas. haven t regret it once
they re proud of the mess they ve made.
he says  what frosk did was corageous  yet what frosk did help cost him his job.  imagine defending someone who s actions put you out of work.  thats a new level of simping there.
looks like he deleted his tweet
so if you  melanie  were a troll like that guy seems to think the absolute worst thing he or anyone else can do is interact with a troll as just like a zealot there is no reasoning with trolls  both trolls and zealots think in a completely different way to most people and anything you say to them will only strengthen them  getting upset and they will see it like blood in the water for sharks its just a sign of weakness for them  getting angry and they see it as getting under your skin  the only real option is ignore them and hope they get board and wander off  most of them have really short attention spans when no one is paying them any attention and will wander off to find someone else to poke
maybe if these people at g4 were more concerned about trying to make good gaming content and less about berating their own audience they wouldn t have tanked so hard. I doubt they would have lasted much longer either way  but they probably could have kept it going for a little bit longer. dont like seeing people lose their jobs but they really did bring this on themselves. I will say its funny to watch them lash out at the people who told them from the beginning that they were doing everything wrong.
melonie... didnothingwrong!
please dont let  em get you down. especially about your beliefs in God. why do they support some religious ideas like islam and the one most were raised in or at least by  I was raised lutheran however Im not sure or practicing but I dont try to be a dick about it. in fact I envy believers and I try to relate because the values are solid! love you channel you beautiful woman you!!
in bizarro world that would have been mean  but here on earth there s nothing mean in your tweet
when I was young  kristen holt  morgan web and olivia mung were the only reason I watched g4tv. what s wrong with liking beautiful women
sad. frosk gets them fired  which many saw coming  but of course  instead of reflecting on the situation and being honest with themselves  they double down. it couldn t possibly be they were wrong  its someone else s fault. I bet these are the same ppl calling others conspiracy theorists until they have to twist reality to convince themselves all the bad things they go through are because of the evil ppl who disagree with them.
you clearly hit a nerve by being a good person  evil cant tolerate that
why would you funnel tens of thousands of dollars a day on a crew of 30  people  when a single person can do the same job in their own home  hell  you dont even need to hire a video editor  just someone that is genuinely passionate about the topics they cover.
please just clap back with  I said the good eggs
that guy thinks multi-million dollar businesses haven t been tanked by individuals in the past and he s calling you an idiot. thats soo rich that I need a glass of milk.
I did not even know your religious affiliation until that clown made a big deal about it.  you dont sound preachy or act like one of the Bible thumping hypocrites.  you posted a thoughtful tweet and did not call anyone out by name.  he is the one with a problem.  keep on keeping on.
let me play the smallest violin for g4 tv.
I have no clue what g4 is  but still love the video. one observation  not about you  that those who claim to be the most inclusive tend to be the most exclusive. I dont know how that works out  but seems to be the case. and while Ive only watched a small handful of your videos  I want you to know that you are not insane. we just happen to have been transported to bizarro s world. God bless.
aww  you hurt his widdle feefees.
the dude was clearly simping for frosk and ended up making a fool of himself on the internet showing that g4 dying and going away is a good thing because people like him are going to cope and seethe as they try to look for another job.
lmao. that guy probably praised will smith for the slap. exceptional use of the quote by the guy since you didnt call out any name at all. well it wasnt exceptionally good but it was exceptional for sure.
weirdos gonna be weird...sounds like that dude needs to stay off the twitters until he gets his self in a better place....but he wont.
you left by far one one the most gentle and sympathetic comments about the whole thing. imagine freaking out on a comment and insulting the person s religion like that and still walking away thinking youre morally superior.
sessler went from based to free based
a former video editor has 0 impact on any company s decisions  they are just video editor s getting video s send to them understanding nothing off the business behind the company on the why that company exist. so a video editor not knowing the company s audience doesnt suprise me at all  infact that this video editor rooted for frost is actually expected because I certainly didn t expected any brain behind that video editor s mind other than a sheeple mindset.
dante s inferno gate has always been the motto of my life    despair all ye enter here   paraphrase   but Im adopting Christ to an extent.
because the salt  must flow
10 08 as a mississippian  I wouldn t trade living here for living in new york  l.a.  or san francisco for anything.
well if they gonna be rude anyways  just do your thing
somebody should tell the good sir knight that frosk isnt into dudes
good job! much wow
keep our names out of your mouth. and your eyes off of our content  apparently.
absolutely based take on amouranth.
monetize them all!
a.sess is such a bummer now.  hopefully he gets free lines in the afterlife
I dont share some of your opinions nor have much sympathy for your faith  but I believe you to be a nice person  you dont shove your ideas down others  throats  you simply share what you think and sometimes it happens to involve your faith... and stating facts  or the obvious  definitely doesnt make you mean nor hateful.
he wanted me to be an asshole to him. thats a game I know how to play.
Im with you mel  dudes quoting wil smith are naught but trash humans.  hopefully they get some experiences that help them see through the insanity
he seriously quoted wil smith btw looking beautiful keep doing ur thing
always and Imean always. monetise your haters. well done
hopefully the good people rise from the ashes like a phoenix and make a radical change to a much better g4tv  as in go back to the age when g4 had good in it  not resort to acts of terrorism or go woke  like what most people think of when applying a radical change to something
no youre not crazy. obsessed with lara croft yes  but not crazy.
anyone who has an issue with your take is g4  and deserves to be insignificant like g4.
youreap what you sow.
respect you and your opinion butif you look at it from the only fans communityyour opinion  even if it is not ill intent  might be interpreted as judgmental.still a valid opinion and you shouldn t be attacked for ithowever when someone feels their way of life is being attacked  be it the models or the subscribersyou should expect this kinds of backlashI personally do not care if someone doesnt agree with me  I tend to have unpopular ideals as well   still sorry you are getting so much hate but you have a great support system  -
the frosk simp was kinda right  just for the wrong reasons. their youtube views were super low  they had a bloated staff and the comcast higher ups were definitely paying themselves first. they were effectively done before they started.thatsaid  the frosk rant and adam clapping like a seal for it did not help the fans get the warm and fuzzies.
damn. melonie mac is an absolute sweetheart  the antitheses of evil. this dude has something else going on I think  like most woke knobs. they re an angry lot.
faith aside  Ive never herd you say anything else that I havn t agreed with.  you are awesome.  .   .   except the faith   not for me.  science rules.  tomb raider also!!!
you should have just ignored it.  now they know you ll respond.
adam sessler making  your mom  jokes to clap back at others in 2022 is truly sad. please pray for him  and his mental sanity.
dont worry we all stand with you melonie dont let sjws get under your skin continue speaking the truth
I love you melanie  3
dont pay thatscrub miller any mind. he s just one of those miserable people that aren t happy unless everybody around them is also miserable.
I never heard about your channel until his comment so look at it as free advertising for you!
its good that we are now seeing the patterns of mean people in the woke community. they make unnecessary uncalled for unrelated  insults
its not mean at all  continue speaking the way you do  because after watching over 5-6 of your videos you take a pretty fair stance. you aren t harsh or mean so I respect your point of view. dont let this douche bag   like wow when I read it  I was like man who is this dude  then saying that frost was  courageous   gtfo
adam sessler though...seriously  even when responding to people who are hurling toxic insults st me online Im not near as hateful as him and Ive had my bouts with anger issues  he needs help
he s doing the equivalent of saying the n word a lot without saying the n word  and much more. its quite insane really  and I can agree. you drop that act the moment you aren t in complete pain and denial  if you work in the back room even for a normal company  you forget that part of your life and do better. this dude is proud af of it. sick and twisted. never questioned if hurt people hurt people bc he is so sure his opinion is correct  which is a logical fallacy in and of itself.
he just showed what a lack of class he has. people like him are miserable and project their own actions and intentions onto other people.
they ll hate us because they hated him first.
hey melonie! graceful response to this dude s over-the-top and unprovoked attack. never apologize for your faith   remember that we were called to suffer many things for the sake of the gospel.
former editor . he s a  former - because he cant edit. he let her idiocy out  for the world to hear. it destroyed g4tv  a show that used to be awesome when morgan webb was there. frosk killed it. he allowed it. so of course he s butt-hurt. youre opinion was deadly accurate. thats what pissed him off.
they only include you if you believe in what they spout.
looks to me that youre angering the right people. keep up the good work young lady.
daammnn  they went full will smith on you . . . we all know . . . never go full will smith . . .
as you said  gaslighting.and Im glad you didn t fall for the  use of anger  falacy. if you escalate your discourse you will be seen as a evil.
as much as I dont want to be a bav guy  I honestly have to say that there is no way kaits husband has a side in this story. even if he did  Im certain he s the amber teard of this story. also  more people were focused on the abuse and not the subject of relationships with sex workers.as for that joshua a--hole  he can go toss bear salad. and Im not talking about the animal. frosk was largely responsible for the state that g4 is in now and she even went as far as making light of the layoffs by stating her survival instead of expressing sympathy for her colleagues  which she ended up paying for anyway . like flash said  g4 probably wouldn t last forever. but frosk certainly accelerated the process.
I haven t heard how morgan webb  kevin periera  or olivia munn thought of this catatstrophe.
I have watched the frosk rant at least 20x and I have yet to hear where she slammed  the audience  rather than talking to specific people in the comment section. she was wayy off about a lot of the things she spoke about  especially the stuff about munn. I just genuinely cant fathom it.
got subscribe from me just for evening mentioning free will. carry on
some people just cant help but be ugly all the time. I dont believe in  or like religion  but I respect and understand how important it is to others. it takes more energy to be vile than it does to be tolerant  and I am a lazy sob so I choose tolerance.
I can kind of see where the g4 dude was coming from. to an extent. from your perspective you weren t coming at the people so much as just trying to be objective but from that dude s perspective I can see how it may have come off like you attacking their dream. and if history has taught us anything  to crush a person s dream can be as devastating if not more than any physical transgression against them. not saying the reaction to your tweet was justified but just that I think I can understand a little bit of the place where that person s response may have been coming from
so he pulled a will smith without pulling a will smith
whenever a leftist says something about a  good Christian veneer   the way this guy did  projection 101. its about  sinning less   not  being sinless   and thats where they ll always miss the boat in regards to us. when you think you are perfect and think you can afford to pass judgment...thats when you need God s aid the most. I think they need him more than they admit they do.
I wouldn t even care for the twitter weirdos  they live a sad life.
I dont really know who you are but no one should feel outside of gaming or nerd culture due to their faith or politics.the only caveat I would make to that is keeping out the woke who want to parasitize our hobbies into political positions pushing out the core fanbases... f those people.
sex working per-se isn t any more predatory than the average businness venture. yes you can dial it in to be absolutely horrifyingly predatory towards either the simps  or the workers  or both  but you can do the same strategy on other businnesses too so its not a problem with the job in itself.we ve seen this with gaming getting gamble-ized to profit from gambling mechanics more than from game sales  and thats not anywhere near enough to call all gaming predatory. also yes for everyone asking  my amaranth fart jar collection looks great.
I can hear the jealousy he  wasn t born a natural woman  all in his post. but Im glad  I wasn t going to wish them well  care    will always have bad things to say to bottom feeders like this. no wonder no one knew who he was at g4tv
the woke snowflake pronoun princesses are insane. theres no other way to describe them
that josh guy didn t need to make that tweet.
wasn t g4 the product of a rich dads son getting a ton of money to make a failed channel  what I find funny is with all that money they failed to capture the views or ratings some indepent person with a camera in a bedroom could accomplish.  not a knock on you or any content creators on youtube  but a compliment  you currently have more of a following then many of the g4 channels youtube videos  I checked a few of g4s linked videos ... and they had a large backing  and support sooo many content creators would love to have. itshows money cannot buy good content or passion! keep up the great work!
well its obvious frosk had help sinking g4  especially since he was a lead editor. but g4 was never a multimillion dollar company...unless your counting the money they lost.
the quartering sent me this way and after watching this vid I subbed..
I dont wish bad on sessler. I have the same attitude to him as I have to every single person on the planet including myself. I pray to God that he reaps what he sows. if he sows nothing but a constant stream of venom and bile  thats on him.
keep our names out yo mouth never used a single name to begin with huh
I just looked this clown up on twitter and he has since made his tweets protected.  hiding behind cover and cowering is a clear sign that you are losing.
when it comes to people calling you evil for expressing an opinion they dont like  all their really doing is admitting that they know what their doing is wrong. tell me...what is a thief s reaction towards someone turning on the porch light because they heard a sound outside  if what someone is doing is just fine then why would some random person s opinion matter to them  and likewise  who are they to tell others what they can or can not say  put into fewer words why not be silent then since it is evident the opinions of others are an offense unto themselves
Im not subscribed  but it is noticeable that youre not exactly kicking people while they re down.  my guess is thatsome people actually hate and will lie about good people.
good stuff  melonie. there was nothing wrong with your tweet for that guy to react the way he did. I suggest digging into reformed theology for a more biblically consistent understanding of free will though.
throw a stone into a pack of dogs.  the bitch that yelps is the one you hit. or the one you were not referrring to.
do you think you could ever do a video with alex zedra the team was beautiful women making a video together would be really cool.
emotion vs logic  dem vs repub.   yin    yang it is a dichotomy that has existed since the dawn of humans. his emotional reaction was an equal and opposite reaction to your logical observations.  the intensity of his reaction only means you made an excellent point.
I like the beginning of the video the way you said I wasn t even  mean dude 0 12
if a single person cant sink a multi-million dollar company  then why do scapegoats exist   josh doesnt really understand how the world works.
anybody notice how cross eyed she is
I just recently discovered your content and I went back and watched several videos from earlier this year.  I decided to post this on a more recent video to increase the chance you will see it.  isaiah 54 17no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper  and every tongue thatshall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. this is the heritage of the servants of the Lord  and their righteousness is of me  saith the Lord.
and that is why they failed  no self awareness  yes one person can in fact take down an entire network when that person decides their message would be to attack their viewers  and the rest of the network backs them up  so again yeah she is responsible for you all losing your jobs  and its sad none of you had the real courage to shut her up because you all knew she was full of crap and would ruin the network.regardless of what they say you keep spreading the message  remember its not an easy road we walk on but we have to for our faith.
well from what I understand g4tv had no game.
seems like it was really 2 people that killed g4  but it does appear the general attitude of the staff might not have helped. hopefully the media companies start paying attention to the ideological biases of their staff so they get a product  not a cultish ideological pulpit.
these people simply cant respond  all they can do is react. sad
remember isaiah 21  woe to those who put sweet for bitter  and bitter for sweet. the person who went on an unhinged rant  slandering the audience  is a good person. the person who showed compassion for others is a bad person.
the only time I find religion to be annoying is when people push their ideals on to others for the choices they make. as a satanist  and no I dont actually worship satan people  I will die for people s right to a freedom of their own religion. his response sounds like he is very frustrated deep down but he doesnt want to speak out against the people who said anything at all. that or he refuses to learn idk
stay you.  its refreshing.
well its not like the g4 people have a job to do now anyways gotta stayed occupied somehow.
the title should be adjusted to  beta male snaps at me
people who spout tolerance and inclusion are usually the biggest bigots. Im proud of you melonie for sticking to your faith and your beliefs. and I ll keep supporting you.
Jesus Christ is awesome. thank-you Lord for another great day!
perhaps you should have pointed out the fall back on losing your job....that is learn how to code.   how much different canthat be for out of work gamers
narcissists cant relate to empathy  which you gave them. josh isn t one of the good eggs
alls they preach is inclusiveness and love and goodness  yet all they spew is hate rage and toxicity lol.
josh thinks thatsingle person cannot tank a multi-million   business  artesian builds does t ring a bell
Im sorry he said that to you. as soon as elon confirms twitter deal  Im going to start going after these leftist
wow. that guy has issues.
to be fair  you made a direct attack at anyone corporate side  and tried to be cool camera side and maybe writer side. out of touch people trying to squeeze money out of a dying platform  g4  are just going to be pissed and take a swing at anyone like a 5 year old in mid-tantrum. deal with it  not to be harsh  just its going to happen. we love you and youre great. just keep going. we gotchu.
youre good.  simple facts are not considered mean to normal people.that g4 guy just proved the point why people people are staring turn on the woke.I find it funny how the woke attack faith  when it is not even relevant.  I wonder if their faith was cornerstone in there lives would this kind of messaging be the same
joshua  the rest of us myself included  are going to keep your names in our mouths and we re going to continue to give you well wishes and pity. I ll also be praying for you as well. how s that for spouting my good Christian venom towards you
Im from mexico city and I agree with the phrase of  go woke  go broke
I cant speak for everyone .. but I can personally say that when frosk went on her triad because she was butt hurt over uninformed takes and said if you dont agree dont watch .. I said cool .. and stopped watching. itseems that g4 tanked sharply after this  so .... yeah .. she probably did it all on her own.
you seem like an awesome person....  youre cool... they re all fucked..  woke folk keep on truckin
g4 was already a relic of the past but frosk really sank thatship faster than the titanic. peak fuck around and find out.
youre not an outsider ma am! a lot of us share your beliefs and opinions. we re the majority  they re the loud  arrogant  selfish minority with hateful   spiteful souls and agendas! making for people with poor personalities which they take naive decisions and perform weak actions.
just tell  em to go get a job.
I ll be honest  frosk had some fair points. for starters they were an absolute prophet when they talked about red dead online  thatshit was dead in the water and they were right to point that out.even in the whole rant portion  though  they had fair points. there are people out there who are weirdly hostile to women and only want women in mainstream gaming who they personally find attractive. do these people make up a majority of gamers  most likely not  but they re certainly not as obscure as bigfoot.regardless  no matter how fair frosk s points may have been  the presentation of those points was all wrong. I suppose there s a joke to be made here about people with poor social skills taking up social activism. if you want to change someone s mind  you have to have the charisma to know how to introduce your ideas in a way that allows people to come to their own conclusion. to realize and accept on their own whether or not their current behavior or beliefs are harmful to the communities they re apart of.you cant just point your finger at them and say   you bad  you big  big problem. change now or leave.  your audience will feel judged and they will abandon you. tl dr  frosk had some fair ideas and meant well  but their methods were way too heavy handed.
. keep up the great commentary.
Im an atheist progressive slightly left than that of sfo. I just haven t gone the atheist plus route if insanity. I appreciate honest people no matter what side of the political aisle they are on.
safe place  safe place  safe place.
melonie   I hope all the good eggs can bounce back and I hope adam can find some happiness. woke lunatics   stop pushing your Christian ideas on us! dont be so hateful  thats out job!
what if its a blessing in disguise  cancelling the snakes dressed in sheep clothes.
it just amazes me how anything certain folks dont like   they label as  woke . the term has absolutely no meaning now as everything is  woke  is a person is  woke  if you dont like them. hilarious.
I understand what frosk was talking about  but she accused all of g4 viewers for being assholes for  flaming  her. then she challenged them to tune out. this put the spot light onto sessler which he has great game commentary  but his political is murderous.  g4 looked down on their audience as rabid addicted morons that need to be put in their place.
your twitter posts were based af mel.
youre an idiot if you think a single person cantank a multi-million dollar business dude  we literally just watched one do it in real time. and the funny thing is you identified by name the person who did it  so you know she did it too.the rest of his post is just laughable.
wow. with your faith how did you survive the fragdolls and super woke ubisoft
melonie  wishes the staff at g4 wellg4   frosk was well intentioned  unlike the venom you spout ....oh  I see. we re living in backwards land where everything you say  the opposite is true huh  frosk wasn t venomous she was well intentioned. melanie offering support and kind words are  vile .now y all definitely dont deserve no pity. didn t know everyone at g4 was adam sessler.
ha ha ha. people like this is the reason so many of us are dancing on g4s grave. keep the woke salt coming! its delicious.
I a  so glad the quartering  brought me hear. just subscribed today.
going after the faith of another seems like rather toxic behavior...the kind of thing someone like joshua likely rails about on incessantly.
hang in there! just remember matthew 5 11 and keep on keepin  on.
how dare miller mansplain to you his ignorance.
other yt commentators have suggested g4tv had been circling the drain for a while. it just took a  courageous and well-intentioned  attack on the audience to speed up the collapse. josh is wrong  one person cantank a million   business but they need to be at the very top. as former lead video editor  josh may have been part of the cabal thatsupported the rant and pulled the chain on g4tv s future. he is understandably bitter at the destruction the management brought about. I have no sympathy  though.
has anyone heard from any  good eggs   they should post anonymously on reddit  I figure they must be bloody livid the rant lost them a good job.
you did the right thing melonie dont let a bunch of crybabies who just lost their jobs come out you like that. they have no one to blame but themselves. most of these people supported thatstupid stuff and now they re mad that they lost their jobs over it. they have all needed a lesson in accountability and now they are getting it.
lol well I dont know what his goal was with a post like that.  he made you more liked and himself less liked  Imean I doubt he had many friends besides frosk and clappy the seal sessler but
why yes frosk certainly was courageous regurgitating talking points that we d already heard from narcissistic bedroom feminists and their God anita by making blanketed mostly false accusations all to feel like a hero. well done frosk. 10 out of ten stunning and braves
people like this prick of a man just dont have any sense of decency when it comes to different opinions. ms. melonie  you just got yourself a new subscriber. keep up the good work and stick to your guns!
even camelot331 got on that tweet  lol
nah  your comment was a general and romedial look from the outside. josh almost sounds like he s meming so just shows how sad he is as a person.
teh cutest  teh best  teh most grounded
its funny how the g4tv staff   she-hulk writers complain so much about so called  incels  being the problem.  so  you mean the guys who are socially awkward  likely dont have a date friday night and spend their time reading comics  playing video games online with friends  or watch gaming streams on twitch or youtube  those guys with nothing better to do than consume nerd pop-culture   thats your ideal customer  dummy!
there are no  good eggs  at g4. they all stood by frosk and cheered her on  including gina. they all deserve to be blackballed for life.
I bet his girlfriends boyfriend disagrees with him.
joshua miller trying to be will smith by saying  keep our names out of your mouth  loses respect for the people who lost their jobs at g4.
was it frosk  if so that how she flirts  lol.
I just hope that matthew 5 11-12 would help you keep your spirits up  blessed are you when people insult you  persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me. rejoice and be glad  because great is your reward in heaven  for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you.
the guy got butthurt real quick. really low level of reading comprehension. the comment clearly said  someone  and  the network  in the same sentence and this guy automatically came to the conclusion of  a single person.  the guy is clearly blaming frosk for all the faults and is virtue signaling.
Im glad the whole show tanked. there was no  good eggs  as they were all applauding. they are happy when they bring things down so be happy for them.
do what I do...agree with all the bad things people call you.  I just enjoy the shock factor and ultimately dont really give a shit what people think.  I get called all the normal stuff woke people call someone.  you d be surprised how flustered and pissed off they get when you agree with the names they call you.  they dont know how to respond when not only you agree  but you own it with pride.  I am a homophobic  racist  misogamist  transphobic  fascist  bigot.  or so Ive been called.  but  I wear those names with honor.
Im gonna be honest I cant imagine being mad at you. there s other women that are pretty that I can be justifiably mad at. but idk youre one of those girls where youre so cute even if you burned my house down. I d never talk to you again but I wouldn t yell at you. weird and nothing to do with the topic but just something I noticed just now.
thank you so much  God bless
what frosk did took no courage. it was the safest thing she could do while surrounded by fellow radicals and virtue signallers.
I find itso ironic that the same people who support a company and frosk who tried to call out sexism in gaming  which was uncalled for and not needed are the same people who then go and attack a women for having an opinion. I guess they only care about women who agree with them. if not you get thrown in the trash with the rest of us. starting to sound like their cultists.
drunk3po s comment was the best lol
g4...go woke  go broke.2021 was a good year  we were getting our beloved channel back from the ashes    along the way  it turned into a circus. gamers hosting shows  youtube talents passed off as  g4 personalities  when all it was  was repeated videos we ve seen 40 times plus. and then  frosk had to play  angry gender gamer woman  because fans called her out for her lies on air and for her league of legends controversy    adam sessler insults his fanbase for asking about games   going after anyone who disagrees with his political views....and the end of g4 happens. let s just erase the last year out of our memory.and youre not insane  youre one-of-a-kind. haters will hate because they like to look at the negative.
I a agree with you its not cool that he got so  but hurt about your comment your pretty sweet
its funny how everyone is in the game industry is hella agressive to ones faith especially Christianityya know what josh will learn  karma always swings back
he called g4 a multi-million dollar business  sorry josh  multi-million dollar businesses dont shut down in less than a year. multi-million dollars worth of debt maybe...
woke people are just not nice they cant be.
he s correct. it wasn t a single person that tanked the company. it took an entire team to do it.nothing about your tweet justified that kind of response. if anything  you must be over the target to get that kind of flak.
fuck yeah
always funny -- and creepy -- to see some man snap so aggressively at a woman for matters that frankly doesnt involve him  re  apparently this josh person was fired before g4 got shut down .as for the other stuff  I dont think youre looking at the full picture  but youre not at all a bad person on opposing sw. Im net in favor of of and swers  because studies have shown that the suppression leads to more sex violence than the allowance of sw   but I d be a fool if I couldn t look at the valid persectives in opposition of it.
just to be clear  I like the video - not the fact that you were snapped at. . . .I think you  melonie mac  have a friend in another youtuber - I think he stutters. . . .and his name is . . . .craig
didn t know there would be a dude out there simping and white knighting for frosk  but here we are. mind blown.
josh wants to will smith slap you.
Imean saying stuff like  sex work is predatory  and  if a man is okay with his wife selling her body he doesnt love her.  is really messed up. like damn. cold. lol. especially the  sex work is predatory  thing. what does that mean  you cant really blame people for getting upset that. overall Im not hating on you  I understand everyone has a right to there opinion  you have a right to your opinion but Im just saying. honestly  I dont really care what people do in their relationship  in their private time. its none of my business. so long as no one is being hurt.
the silent majority is huge and even if it is not  God s side is the only side that matters. keep the faith
she is so cute.  has she been around for a while
I thought this video was going to be more about this josh guy and showing more examples of him being unhinged on twitter  but most of this video felt like a  Im not crazy  right guys  I can be nice!  not questioning your capacity to be nice civil  I guess I was expecting more bloodshed and I was a little bloodthirsty. Im new-ish to your channel and so far Ive been half-and-half with your opinions views. Ive been challenging myself to find different views compared to my own  but without going too far from my views in one go. one of the things Ive been trying to figure out is what  woke  even means anymore because its been beaten to hell and back. in some places  it has a positive connotation  and places like here  it leans more negative. Ive been more exposed to the positive version of it  so it leads me to disagree with one of your statements like  woke people hate Christianity religion  because I think it lacks the nuance of how many layers a religion can have with the types of people drawn to them  I have personally known progressive  woke  Christians. I even got involved with them for a time during college  albeit  not for the right reasons . I apologize for the efap-esque tangents. like you  I like to air my controversial opinions  even though its highly unlikely anybody will really see this or possibly agree with what I have to say
we love you melly mel
these channels take seriously 3 minutes worth of information and stretch it to an unnatural length constantly sprinkling in opinions and conspiracy. itskews the truth.
@asclepius  would you hate me for agreeing with prioritizing civil rights over religious values  at least the way I see it  its like having an  on off  switch for the religious stuff  albeit it probably depends on how outwardly religious someone is  excluding stuff like needing to wear religious garbs . the kind of Christians I had joined on campus were the  book club  types who were just open to anybody within the vicinity to join the organization. that was compared to those who were in the middle of campus shouting  Jesus Christ is your savior!  while holding large signs  occasionally handing out pamphlets about why abortion is murder. I eventually left the organization due to some conflicts of interest. Im just not that religious  but the experience was interesting. not saying that its bad to be a  Christian first  kind of person  but I see it more beneficial to have it  play in the background  and be more outward with it at home designated places of worship.  wokeness  to me seems to have been a double-edged sword something that can be good  but also be easily corrupted. like  Im all for equality equity and acceptance tolerance  but people should not be guilted into it. ya know  the desire to be  woke  should come from within  and people who do not instantly catch on should not be lambasted as that would more than likely push them even further away. ideally   wokeness  can make things like the common workplace a place of little to no strife regarding your identity. but as I said   wokeness  can get twisted and corrupted to where people s identities can go from normalized to commodified  i.e. stuff like diversity hires and advertising people s identities more than the actual content . seeing people s race  gender  sex  orientation  etc. leveraged for publicity disgusts me. its made worse when it actually works and people fall for this fetishy marketing ploy. at this point  its no longer  wokeness   its just the ruling class smelling their own farts.  wokeness  in modern-day entertainment media can work  but it takes effort and proper execution. if I could recommend something to you  I would suggest the 8-episode netflix series  heartstopper.  I watched it with discord friends thinking I wasn t going to really like it because teen dramas are not my thing  but I wound up really liking it because it was really well-written. it was also made in the uk so I guess thats why every character s identity wasn t fetishized for media attention. another side-recommendation would be the owl house as its a disney animated show that has been giving disney the double middle finger in its final season. sorry for the massive essay  and thank you for being the one guy who read this. I hope you one day feel less jaded.
to be honest  while I do think he was way to harsh in his reply and an idiot to attack you for your faith  I do think he s right when he says that one person isn t responsible for a multi-million business failing.  in all honesty I simply dont think that the g4tv model is viable no matter what. blaming a single person for it and then saying that    some   people there aren t bad wasn t gonna cut it.  I dont like wokeness at all   which is why Im here commenting   but a lot of us who dont like it have a tendency to see it way larger than it is and kinda blame it for everything that doesnt work and thats just assumptions based on nothing at all.   all this to say that I do think that the frosk incident was blown out of proportion and a prime exemple of how  hate mobs can be freakin harsh towards an individual on both sides.  I dont know josh miller at all but I can understand him reacting here even though is reaction was very distasteful imo. just my two cents here.  d  love your content btw. keep up the good work mel.
he went will smith on her
do we really need to share our public opinions on every trending social issue  I feel like there are much more productive things we could be doing with our voice and our time.
wooooo drama.   brb getting a stick of butter to snack on for this
all I ll say without starting a fight  is that I respectfully disagree with some of your opinions. you have every right to speak yours.
you sound decent and reasonable. but you know what  whenever I see a woman talk about gaming or nerd culture  I cant take her seriously and I just simply dont trust her.it wasn t always like this. back in 2008-2010  when women s presence started to be stronger in these circles  I was happy. I cheered them on and welcomed them in the gaming community and helped some of them in online games. soon however the likes of anita sharkizean and zoey quinn started popping up. they said that men are evil and sexist and gaming needs to change to women s needs. I remember that I was shocked. back then  initially no one really knew how to relate to these claims. some people cheered them on  some opposed them  the majority ignored it. with time however gamers were attacked with increased freequency and vitriol. there was a whole segment in old people s news  on tv how one girl was killed in cod and that was somehow sexist. we slowly started to realize that there is an entire campaign designed againts us. a campaign created by feminists sjw s to take gaming away from us and make it their own so they could control it. we opposed it and we oppose it until today. shutting down g4 shows how devout and successful we are at it. we love video games. they are our passion and I for one will defend them until I still draw breath.you are a nice piece of tail and you talk sense. you seem nice and intelligent. 10 years ago I would subscribe without thinking. today however I dont trust you. does that make me  sexist  or a  mysoginist   maybe. honestly I dont care. I know however that without the likes of sharkeezian  quinn and that foreskin chick I wouldn t be writing this comment and you would have one subscriber more today.
matthew 5 11  blessed are ye  when men shall revile you  and persecute you  and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely  for my sake.
hey I sympathise with your stance on this issue but please dont mention twitter ratios as a proof of someone being right or wrong. you are actively giving power to people like keffals. and appeal to majority is not the way to go.
was watching the thequartering  came over to   subscribe   and even tho my name is funny all my socks are accounted for...  hello
the problem with bigotry is that is goes both ways  I would have a problem witha anyone imposing their beliefs in me. maybe some people from any side dont dismiss people according to their beliefs  but remember both are big communities and there are a lot of people that do. both sides have a lot of house cleaning to do before calling out the other side  because let me remind you how cristianity has effed up for centuries. if there are people with such radical ideas  radical from a cristian s pov im guessing  is because of this  doesnt mean that over correcting things is the solution  but doesnt mean your ideals are the solution  for all we know both of you could be wrong.
I dont agree with melonie on sex work  I believe itshould be legalized to get it out of the hands of organized crime. but Im not about to crucify someone for disagreeing.
and youre still around and they re gone lol
speaking from an atheistic pov.... sex work may one day be just another kind of work.  Im an ad executive.   Im a janitor.   Im a sex worker.   Im a youtuber.   Im a football player.  etc. we aren t there now. we ve barely even begun the discussion. Im not sure its a good idea  and Im not sure I d really want to exist in a society that honestly believed it. mostly because the people who try to push the idea thatsex work is just like any other kind of work are  at best  morally neutral people. most of them are people I wouldn t want to have a conversation with. Im not sure I d want to be standing in the same foyer with them  as most of them are really odious people. so there s no way I d want to live in a society that they designed. thinking of it without those people involved... Im not sure what kind of society it would take to make sex work as accepted as any other kind of work. it just goes so far against what any society has ever created that it would truly seem inhuman to me.as for the g4tv employee snapping  eh. itsucks that he snapped at you  and was so vicious towards you. and its good that he s getting so little support for it. hopefully this is a sign that the tide is actually turning against this ideology  and that people like him will no longer be in positions of power ... well  anywhere. not just in the games journalism industry  but anywhere. this ideology has combined the absolute worst of atheism and Christianity  as if someone went  what s the worst thing that Christians have ever done  unearned moral superiority with a need to appear morally  pure   yes please - we ll take a few handfuls of that  thank you very much. and atheism  oh boy  yes please  that intellectual superiority complex combined with destructing  destruction  - my apologies  I read that incorrectly - deconstructing everything to show how smart I am  those would go great with my unearned moral superiority and need to appear morally  pure ! woohoo - an unbeatable combo! and look  I get the  envious of everything my opponents have ever created!  for free  oh happy days!  and frankly  it needs to be destroyed.
did youreport the horse-humper
religion  like any other idea  stands and falls on its merit. thatsaid attacking individuals instead of attacking their ideas  while not always easy to prevent as perception  knowledge  or the lack thereof   and willingness to learn are always part of the wrong belief in a cause  must never be a way of defeating an argument.  increasing taxes on raw oil will increase diesel prices and further down the line food and transport prices as well   you believe in a spiritual being  shut up thats no argument that is the tactics of a child not getting what it wants  do not entertain it.
hey  mel  Im sorry for how you got attacked for no reason other than being an self-aware free thought person who s also humble. I hope that pretend woke sjw words doesnt tear you down.
you ve got to shine a light. where s the crop top
while I find your supernatural beliefs silly  I fully agree with your take on woke media.
this video has more views than g4!
let the clowns stay mad  and we can stay laughing at their clown shenanigans. g4tv was already obsolete  and letting that loudmouthed harpy frosk go off on what little audience even gave the the time of day made there already low odds of survival borderline nonexistent.
@starseed warrior  thank you for the complement.as you grow older  you will learn thatsex is not the most important thing in the world. self respect and your convictions are waaaay higher on the list.as for your xbox- thats not how youre supposed to use it you know.
I think sex work should be legal and regulated but I dont think itshould be considered a job that one would  strive  for. I think we should accept sex labor as something that is a necessary part of society but not glorify it as would a scientist or doctor. I dont think anyone should be encouraged into sex work  but on the other hand its delusional to believe we can have a functioning society without sex laborers. sex is a basic human need and not everyone can get it on their own. I dont see anything wrong with two consenting adults exchanging sex for money.
frosk had a point. you just dont support feminism. its even in your pinned tweet.
you may bet the bad eggs got angry at you.
well zero sympathy for you joshua. Im sure this will help you get a new job. how  courageous  of you.
talks about how she s not crazy cause thousands of twitter likes. nah you insane  russianbots
Jesus said the world would hate Christians because of him.  to be holy is to be set apart  so when the world rejects you because of your faith or for Christian values  youre being set apart further.
your tweet was fine boom lady. dude was just being ass mad because his virtual signaling friend potentially cost him his job. rather than taking it out on frosk he resorts to a random ass attack on you a right-winger. being a right-winger or left-winger isn t inherently evil  depends on their policies and values. your statement here wasn t even political it was general well wishes. if dunking on right-wingers makes him feel better  great! I dont understand how that will find him a new job itsounds counter-productive to me but more power to him!
well  we can see why they shut down so fast more and more after seeing responses like this.  obviously your comment wasn t meant for people like him  who are disgusting. your comment was very nice and genuine.  what a gross person.
its incredibly hypocritical to rag on  Christians  for past atrocities when other religions are currently causing atrocities. no religion or minority group should ever play victim  while crying out to be a protected class  while clearly being biased against everyone.
youre a good egg
melonie  I am an ardent atheist but I support your comments and I am disgusted with woke culture and marxism communism gaining traction in america and beyond. we aren t all leftists with kool-aid in our hair and a pound of hardware in our faces.
Christianity brings accountability for one s actions. wokies absolutely depise having consequences for their actions.
keep our names out of your mouth. thats cultural appropriation.
Im curious  if youremoved all the people who believed in the Bible who watch you  I wonder how many back up some stances  I think the g4 guy  or girl  think you said it was a guy  seems to imply not liking you for race stances with fictional characters and  most likely  the anti-gay thing. Im not calling you evil or terrible. just pointing out to you where they re coming from. you said they should try being inclusive to your religion. but let s say I belonged to a religion thatsays women are not allowed to be in the same room as men and tell you to just accept it  you must respect my religion. and I was saying thatsincerely  not sarcastic. you d probably find that pretty insulting and be like screw this guy! that is how they feel if they have a gay friend or are gay and you sit there against it. you have the right to believe it  but they wont like you and from their side of things  yes  they see you as a bad person. again  Im not wagging my finger at you myself. just pointing out for your own understanding  that is why they are hostile towards you and Christians and all other Bible believing faiths.
melanie mac the female nerdrotic
girl  in all due respect  george carlin was very right in a point   keep thy religion to thyself . you mention  your religion  more than 8 times in less than 5 minutes  and that honestly threw me off. if your religion is the defining factor on your content  then I cant see anything worth in it for me.
his response was wholly inappropriate.you didn t reference your faith. you didn t assign blame.you merely showed compassion to the good folks who worked there. because surprise surprise most companies will have good and bad people working there.only thing that remotely made sense was the pity aspect. may not agree with it  but I do understand that its irksome to some folks.all the rest was utter hogwash imnsho.haven t seen all of your vids  but the ones I have seen..youre nuanced and balanced. only calling out the extremists and even then you dont have them on  nuked into oblivion mode.so yeah  dont get his animosity towards you.
I really like her voice she kinda reminds me of the girl in wreck it ralph... subscribe
illustrating perfectly that the g4 redux was doomed to failure at the start. a company built on shaky ground being managed by a clueless poser.
say what they will.. their show is dead and youre awesome
I dont agree with the  if your husbands supports showing your body for money  he doesnt love you.  - cant get behind thatstatement. it is really between the wife and the husband... if wife says hey  I d like to do this  but I d also like your thoughts on it and he is cool with it and supports her  great! if he says I am not cool with it  it makes me uncomfortable  then she should understand that. if she says hey  I am going to start showing my body off  if you dont like it  too bad  then I guess... that marriage is probably over or had issues from the get go  but to blanket statement thatsaying all husbands who support their sig other doing that  are not in love is a bit much.
josh I think deleted his account lol
thought it was will smith with how thatstarted
you know you might find it interesting to find out who owns the majority of porn websites.  I will give you a hint.  our greatest ally.
dude had the audacity to talk about them all - I wonder if confronted with reality this would be the case. stop giving these terrible human being jobs that pay good money because they just waste it on hideous rants online
wow!  talk about  toxic  personalities!  and  if one person couldn t tank an entire company  why did it just fall apart after that temper tantrum
your takes seem normal and sensible to me  but let s face it  most people are far from normal and sensible these days.
let me further elaborate  by other hosts Imeant machine gun smelly and ses pit.
I went to go comment  ratio  on his comment.. but he deleted it or its hidden from me. wouldn t doubt he banned me.
Imean if they dont like your tweets  they shouldn t read them. thats the rule right
people like that make josh s look bad.
melanie youre standing up to evil youre taking a stand against sin and sin nature dont feel bad about it dont be discouraged because when youre on your knees before the Lord when your day a judgment comes you will be able to boldly go to the throne and say I faught the good fight   because the alternative is for Jesus to say  leave me I never knew you  and  that is the worst sentence you could ever hear
I like your voice

Im sure they can all find work. think taco bell is still offering  650 sign-0n bonus.
this is why you should never be nice to these wastes
that dude frosk did welltearing down thatshit g4shit
you are awesome smart beautiful and funny they are jealous because you still have a youtube channel you are everything they are not
youre so funny and cute. boomer s  like me want truth. we are in the background supporting the rise of truth in gaming culture and you are commonsense wrapped in beauty. sorry but beauty doesnt shine like your clean soul. love you you have a  happyhalo
its so sad  they want attention and just cry and cry on twitch and other platforms.
I think that the relationship between amouranth and her husband is between them and I dont think that its wise to speculate about it    I have to disagree on that issue
hahahahaha  my josh  I have made that conclusion too about other unsavory jasons. its a valid take.
they made their bed.
one person cant tank a multimillion dollar biz   oh well  thats a lie and it happened with that computerbuilding company.  p and now g4.
omg that was not just meanthat was violence
well youre still beautiful so youve got that going for ya
is that a needler in the background
ya was very nice

do any of these people attacking you make games or do they just play and talk about them  .because ya know all media is a scam
o how wrong he is cause all it does take is only one person to make an company or anything really fall it also takes one person to spread the Christianity for change this crazy world really needs keep doin what your doin melonie mac Ive got your back

melonie bragging about her hot takes.  she s second only to doug tennaple.
leftists  melonie! youre a terrible person because you dont want women to be sold like commodities!!leftists  melonie! youre a terrible person because you hope that people bounce back and find new employment!!leftists  melonie! youre a terrible person because people like you more than they like us!!melonie  okay... uh  go boom  I guess...leftists  stop ratioing us!!!!!everyone  no. leave melonie alone.everyone  and go boom  like she told you all to.
they were fighting against sexism in the gaming scene and acting like they were the white knights that defends women from incel neckbeards. but it turns out they re doing the same thing they ve accused their fan base of doing.
look at all those kids with cancer who s parents dont pray enough for them to get better.
they should find something creative to do like tp frosk s house  or something  instead of continuing to bash fans.  they re their own worst enemies.
people are nutty. I personally disagree with your opinion   sex work  . I dont think showing pictures of your body online is even  sex work . if you were talking about actual prostitution  yeah sure. but yeah...people are crazy for lashing out at others who have different opinions. there s a discussion to be had. but it can never happen is people are going to flip out about it.
reality will always catch up with the woke nut jobs
good to know joshie is a nut case who exposed his reputation.
you wasn t mean at all
I wouldn t worry about what some emotion driven man-child says.and from this old boys perspective  you are far prettier than that amor-something-girl.
I didn t believe butt babies could actually exist. this miller guy is proof that I was wrong.

kentuckian and mississippian joint citzen here  a californian bragging about that is a gas.
you are the normal one. people on twitter are fucking crazy.
!!that!!! not onky means you are rightit means....youve hit da bigtyme jeyeah!! uh  stalkers and blasphemy and your family being harassed.....ah  fame.....
you know what I say when idiots try and use my faith against me aren t you glad Im not the savior because if I was  wed all be fkd
hard disagree on your comments about sex-work. youre perfectly allowed to tweet a virtual-signal about onlyfans models or whatever the f u c k and talk about how you think its wrong. just like people are allowed to pushback on your aggressive holier than thou comments. thatsaid big fan of your channel and even though I think your opinion is misguided on the topic of sex-work I respect it.
well to be fair he did not insult your religious beliefs. he said you hide behind them. subtle difference
suuuhhhhp mel. ice cream and Jesus
here from the quartering
cant win with the wokies
one can have an opinion and be wrong. for example  it is truly my opinion that the sky is yellow but literally everyone tells me its blue. I dont believe them.
he made a big discord push then had it moderated so heavily it was embarrassing to his brand. I kinda checked out on him after that. he went overboard trying to keep stuff civil like stavros from cumtown  and it made him lame. but its good to know he still likes to prop up others and is sorta a genuine guy. I still watch trillium bc she has a positive attitude that could balance out even the most unstable person and have them looking on the bright side.
@jason atkins  I stopped watching him awhile ago  but started again about a month ago I think he has improved himself in a lot of ways
I thought it was all  if you dont like it  dont watch it  peace . listen to frosk  joshua nobody.
didn t you know  youre not allowed to have an opinion that kicks back at  the message .
hail!
porqu  y para que
this should be a lesson to the rest of the industry. they need to quitshoving their politics down everyone s throat and just make good games with none of the woke bullshit.
it is 3 00 pm est on 10 20 and that guy is still replying and blocking anyone who replies to him not agreeing with him. you are living rent free in this poor guys head for days now. imagine the stress and frustration he is causing himself while trying to defend thatshoddy hill. it really is sad.
melonie how dare you to have different opinions!!! the way this g4tv and of mob get so easily triggered shows you hit a nerve haha
uh-ohhhhhhhhhhhh!angies!!!!
wow. mississippian here.
I will subscribe to you
g4 attacked the audience   what did they say   I have to agree with the comment being highlighted here though  at least in so far as g4 wasn t tanked by some woke comment.  its silly to think it was.  g4 failed because it wasn t entertaining.  full stop.  that commenter was rude af though.
Im curious....whats your faith
sesslers early life section has been scrubbed.  but look for a rabbI sessler in la.  kanye is not insane.
that dude it a bowl of turds and made that channel worse. he and frosk were the weakest links. completionist and gina were the work horses.
courageous   it was stereotypical drivel.
your pets keep distracting me from listening lol
well at least we know who isnt going to heaven
courageous and well intentional   funny way to spell dumb and crazy there josh huh
Christianity
jp but seriously bro needa get his act together
your comment was meant for the  good eggs   so you clearly weren t talking to this goof that responded anyway.
a pushover like that will never have their employment valued by any corporation. he gets what he deserves  another number at the unemployment line.
mac  you were being very diplomatic and correct with what you said. you weren t blaming an entire staff. from what you said  without naming said person  a lot of good people lost their dream job because said person went on a rant against the audience. you did so without insulting anyone.hmmm . . . . joshua miller says one person cant sink a network. so . . . . I guess he is saying the whole crew is bad. then he proceeds to personally attack you.but I guess that is okay for him to attack a woman and attack your faith as a Christian. but if you have an critical opinion that differs from him or frosk then you are a misogynist. no personal attack just a difference of opinion.I see adam sessler does not like the  get woke go broke  saying. says he s woke but not broke. but the point is  companies that get woke have gone or are going broke. so I laugh. Im a meanie  though. Im like that.money  oh. I love money more than myself. I keep trying to sell myself off for scientific experimentation and two minutes after sale Im being returned. even scientists dont like my jokes.
that guy was pretty cringe
respected  supportive  but melonie.... sexism in gaming
projecting your insecurities on others is weak
miller
I live in mississippi...
your comment was fine  his was an emotional mess   spiteful.
evil always attacks Christians.
Im typically a very graceful and merciful person... but Ive lost my patience with these woke snowflakes.
to be fair  that comment does sound like the stereotypical passive-aggressive woman. the response to it was fully aggressive and ridiculous.
doesnt he have better things to do than argue on twitter  ..like looking for a job maybe.
youre based
keep our names out of your mouth .... she didn t use anyone s name and doesnt know who you are  nobody does  get your ego under control fella. maybe if this kind of energy was directed at stopping your co-worker from pissing on the people that made your job possible  we d not be talking about it not being a job any longer.
gettin  will smith vibes from joshua right now.. brace yourself for the incoming smack.  good riddance to him and those like him at defunct g4. what a bunch of lops.
only fans hustlers preying on gimps
never heard of joshua millar. dont like him already. his will smith impression was super douchy though. so it was spot on.
bruh people are still defending frosk  lmao.
melonie     how dare you!!!!!!!!!! you ruined my childhood!!!!!
hI  fellow simp here
my name is john and I agree with you
to be fair even time someone mentions a God  a tumor in my brain grows  but Im on the non-woke side. Im a bit mixed on that bag.
why the fuck do people always gotta attack each other s faith or lack there of. Im an atheist and have had people do this. its in no way relevant to the conversation at hand so why mention it
thing is being woke is a religion  so it makes sense the wokes lash out at your religion
well  sadly no  mississippI is in the bottom 10 of happiness. I dont agree with adam punching down with that kind of comment  however.
Im happy to be one of your minions. the guy is a jerk.
we who are conservative are not allowed an opinion.
too much soy in his diet.
some of miller s people really dont like Christians so dont take it too personally.
the soy boy answer to will smith!
so g4 thinks they re will smith  reactions like the g4 people are having just make things worseI used to watch g4 as a teen - was an awesome channel back then  but seeing it fall like this is super sad
what you said wasn t even mean. it was actually really nice. this dude just needs to lay off the soy and avocado toast...
people seem to think Christianity is what they see in God s not dead movies...
algorithm comment
Im glad g4 imploded and I hope it happens to other outlets that promote anti-gamer propaganda.
mississippi. where men are men and women are armed.
can I simp  can I just simp .. youre so pretty
lol sounds like you have been living rent free in his head before your tweet. I bet he didn t even read what you said just went on an unhinged rant.
courageous and well intentioned   what happened to the standard  stunning and brave  response  I hate it when a snowflake goes off script.
matthew 10 22-23 22 you will be hated by everyone because of me  but the one who stands firm to the end will be saved. 23 when you are persecuted in one place  flee to another. truly I tell you  you will not finish going through the towns of israel before the son of man comes.
nobody should treat their wife like that
frosk is a massive downgrade from olivia munn  like  no shit g4 tanked.
joshua miller needs Jesus. and a new job.
lemme guess  male feminist
calling you a turd lmao. laughable.
God didn t give us free will. lucifer got cast down to hell for wanting free will. thats kind of one of their tug of war points.
dude Im a militant atheist and even I have no idea where the hell this oke fell off tuning you about religion.I gotta agree though yo the woke hate Christianity but love islam for some reason. basically the same shit but hey  whatever fits the agenda on the day  right
just another unhinged  insane twitter weirdo. move along people  dont make eye contact  he might bite you
yuck those tats nasty
here you go. that person just lost their job  they lashed out they are taking offense to people making comments. they might not be able to see the brightness of light.are they a bad egg. no. are you a good egg  no.they are just a person going through something and lash out to those they think helped create their problem.human beings. sometimes in most need of love and support aren t able to see the love and support others are offering.
I wont hesitate from dunking on religion its stupid. but when it has nothing to do with the topic I wont mention it. you were good willed they were garbage.
tehe
attacking you for your religious beliefs  wow so tolerant.
and thats why I support putin      crap g4
seriously. good riddance to bad rubbish.
you ask for respect  but yet you get upset at anything that goes against your beliefs. way to be a hypocrite. you have to give respect to earn respect
religion is disgusting. faith is beautiful.
the white knight rides again.
this is about virtue signalling  as g4tv lost everything to virtue signalling.  there is a little fable story about an ancient king and his chief engineer.  the king wanted a ship built a certain way from the age of sail.  the chief engineer disagreed with the king  and he said that there is a better way.  it is something from the engineer s mind  and never tested and there is no demonstrable evidence  words and not real data.  the king had the engineer put to death  and the king appointed a new engineer who would obey him.  the moral of the story  words mean nothing to the powers that be  and they want evidence and deeds.  virtue signalling is a graveyard of liars before the kings.  deeds not words.  love isn t what you say  love is what you do.
ok i
squirm in faeces g4. good riddance to bad rubbish
it is more of a test of loyalty. man has freewill to follow God or be separated from him forever. if we did not have that choice  God would have never placed the tree of knowledge of good and evil in eden  the only thing that would put man in rebellion against God. since God is life itself denying him is death  which is what hell is. a place without God.
@dmars  thanks for the well thought out reply. you seem very knowledgeable about this subject. I hope you dont mind if I pick your brain a little because Im very interested in your answer. is  God s will  real then  if its a test of loyalty and you fail did God will it  was that his plan for you to fail  he never wanted you to be loyal  if God has a plan for everyone are we making our own decisions or just the ones he s already planned out for us to make  anyone feel free to answer with their opinions.
@dmars  oh dont worry there s no right or wrong answer.great answer. you did a fine job  thank you.
typical liberal argument...insults and not facts
religion is cringe tbh
kinda ironic  you talk about being inclusive  while attacking  woke  people  no type of hate like Christian love.
why are you still on this weird reactionary grift arc. its cringe.
how the hell are you a brand  well I guess not anymore  and you tell people to keep our names out your mouth might as well just say. keep your eyeballs off our content and dont click on any of our videos!!!with a Christian bigot thrown in for good measure. marketing 2022
you cant have it both ways  by giving your opinion on a public server  you are enticing people to reply  Christianity is probably not the best example of morals  especially when it comes to choir boys  dodgy nazI popes  inquisitions  etc.  but hey if you feel the need to give opinions  thats your choice. I am not judging you for being a Christian   but should you be judging men who support their wives profession
your original tweet was a backhanded remark to the people who lost their job. people like you are only famous for hating everything and cant imagine you can make some actual good content
cope
@matt d. law  yeah Imean  thats religions primary purpose
I d avoid talking smack about content when melonie has thousands of subscribers and you ve got nothing remotely close to her ballpark...
@otterloopb  oh man  because sub count matters that much. there are people that make much better content out there with fewer subs. but you do you
