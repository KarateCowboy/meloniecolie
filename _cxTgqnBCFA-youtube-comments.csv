every time that happy meal commercial for wakanda comes on  I feel so angry and sad. we re raising a generation of narcissistic  graceless  racist children who are being taught they can only relate to people based on looks  not virtue  character and resolve.
superman is a perfect example of a selfless character to me. he s basically a God who will still stop to help any old shmuck and not because they re going to praise him but because he s a highly moral character  in most issues  who wants to just make the world a better place.
nailed it! narcissism is a growing sickness in our culture nowadays. its a tragedy.
you are 100  right  society is off kilter right now. family is the answer and the government is pushing for no family.
they re pandering to a  modern audience  that dont buy nor support any of these products  they dont show up to conventions  events  shows  theaters  arenas   concerts
Im not tired of superheroes. Im tired of bad movies that also tell me how awful I am.
great video  melonie. I think back to emily blunt s expression of  boredom  at all the  strong female lead  scripts she gets. there are so many indicators that point to these extreme ideas finally beginning to die out.
in japan  we had many great girls  comics and anime like roses of versailles and little princess sarah.  I enjoyed them as a straight boy because they were well made and I could relate to the characters as a fellow human being.  as an adult  I still enjoy chihayafuru and his and her relationship  another anime for girls.  I am glad I have the capacity to enjoy people getting blown up in the fist of northern star on the one end and romantic novels for girls in the other.
I love superhero movies. but not the most recent stuff. you hit the nail on the head melonie. I really enjoy your videos. I always look forward to them. take care of yourself. happy early pre-birthday melonie.
wow  I think this might be the best way this problem has been described.
one main thing regarding fandom that these wokists were able to exploit was  yes  a fan of a property will see themselves in that property  whether thats in the shoe s of a character  as a self insert  or just simply they resonate with a particular character or story. the problem is  they exploited that by making self-reflection literal. kinda like how they ve gaslighted the concept of  diversity . to them  seeing yourself in a particular character means that you literally see yourself. rather than universal traits  ideals  morals  virtues  and tropes.
I agree. my entire life I have valued quality over quantity often using the analogy of 4 quarters vs 100 pennies and the worth of each individually.  I think you nailed it by identifying this current climate as narcissistic. there are some classic traits they share. a narcissist  or person with narcissistic traits  has an exaggerated sense of self-importance  a lack of empathy  a constant need for attention and praise  fantasies about power  a sense of entitlement  and a history of exploiting others for personal gain. they need therapy for their mental illness personality disorder not million dollar movie   tv  deals to make indoctrination propaganda. not joining your club   ima pass on the kool-aid  no thanks.
let s look at starfire s daughter  ok  need I say more    hahaha
for my fellow comics readers our heroes are men and women like daredevil  wolverine  nightwing  captain america  storm  wonder woman  the tmnt  the shadow  etc. we just want good stories involving these and other characters overcoming great odds to save the day.for the current crop of writers  their heroes are themselves and their God is their politics. their stories are awful because they can only think  about pushing their views on everyone
I like the direction you went with this. I think we all could start thinking outside of ourselves a bit more. its strange to say it  but the fact that nobody is actually caring about someone else s pain is destruction to us all. a lot of anime even teaches us to see others pain  but somehow those messages are always missed  because of this woke religion. I still say this woke religion reminds me of what charles mansion did years ago  and had those women do those awful thing. in fact last night I even saw that as an example in guild wars 2 when I played last night  where the guy went to go save the women due to being brain washed  while you have to save everyone in you city. after he tries saving her he then becomes brain washed and you have to kill them both. it was really sad  and thats what were seeing these days.
I saw black adam  and enjoyed the heck out of it.  it was reminiscent of how super hero movies used to be.   some of the characters felt like marvel knock-offs but who cares   I didn t feel like I was having woke bs shoved down my throat  other than the filler before the previews.  looking at you maria menounos.   the rock did not disappoint  and there was still a good overall message that if people work together for a common goal  they dont need superpowers.
100  agree  mel. I love wesley snipes as blade for example. why  because he s a perfect casting! I love my hero academia and we ll over 1 3 of the characters in it. why  because they re well developed and very related at a character level and its that level that anyone can relate to.
exactly! when youre comfortable with yourself  you dont have the need to be represented or be related in some way or form when youre watching a movie. the purpose of reading a story book and watching movie  especially a scifI or fantasy  is to escape and let the story take you to another world or life.
this is why  even though by no means is he a character that has had amazing runs in his comic  is necessarily a well written character  or has branched out to be the top of his field in other forms of media  excepting a couple of very memorable appearances in fighting games  spawn is my personal favorite. todd mcfarlane knew what he wanted to make  created this character and his story  and has stuck by it even to now. because todd still makes all the decisions in the direction he wants to take him  including any new movies like the one thats still trying to be made. the first film did not age well and was a product of its time  like the character  but todd knows his audience  and has stuck by his audience. he knows that without them first and foremost loving the comic  the original product  the rest falls apart. thats why now  marvel for sure  but dc fast approaching thatstatus  put other forms of media above what should be the main concern and that is the comic and that is story drives everything. todd knows what spawn is all about and why we buy the comics  his powers  he uses guns  other spawns do more so   and the art! todd does what he can with the story  but you have to give it up to someone who has kept trying to entertain us issue after issue and now has been doing so for so long with spin off series that are doing well on their own. thats a testament to someone who listens to their audience and gives them what they want and he gets what he wants. it also doesnt hurt  more so for what you believe in and others that do  that al simmons was written as an atheist  but was still sent to hell. you ll never see that kind of messaging anymore and just like how matt murdock  daredevil  was created as a practicing catholic  who sometimes strays from the faith  these elements are important storytelling devices whether people believe or not. but you were never hit over the head with them like comics like to do nowadays and almost all of entertainment in general. but we still have todd  and there is still new spawn to read and just like when he debuted all those years ago  he s still the antithesis to the mainstream.
you nailed the causes of the poor quality  but Im not sure the quantity has anything to do with politics. thatseems purely business related to maintain the monthly subscribers on disney . they kind of have to keep cranking out content  whether its good or not . I would actually argue that moving to the streaming service model hurt the franchise just as much as politics.the streaming service also plays into the increase in viewer backlash. theatrical releases will just not be seen by people that aren t very interested. streaming service content was already pre-paid by subscribers and they ll watch garbage just to complain about it  as it doesnt cost them any more to do so. I think not enough focus is on the nature of disney .
I should ve known back when they marketed commercials for it  they did the same thing with captain marble and looked how that turned outits nothing but product
its your job as a parent to raise your kids right. if you let media raise your kids for you  you get what you deserve.
@24 frame davinci  the issue is you can raise your kid right  but you cant trust other people to raise their kid right.  you can be proud your kid isn t racist  but if every other kid is racist against them thats still not a fun time.
@younger544  thats any point in history all over the world in some form or fashion. all you can do is be the best parent you canto your kids. you cannot control how others turn out. thats just life  unfortunately.
well  part of what you  see  as virtue  character and resolve are greatly built by a heritage and your perception of life  and this heritage is definetly not only good stuff.also  thinking that now we are raising people that can only relate with looks is a really shallow interpretation of life   thats been the reality for quite some time and the only difference is that now people from different backgrounds  collor skins  countries or whatever can relate to their looks as well.
wait  wakandan have a mcdonalds
@diego silveira  I would like to ask tou not yo project your lack od empathy to everyone else.for decades people had no problem with movies and other media featuring people with different characteristics to theirs. will smith  morgan freeman  eddie murphy and others were long since beloved actors and asian cinema is still quite popular.the main backlash comes from delibarate and malicious actions by hollyweird.
@strange faced   captain marble  I love it!! hahahha
I can say it affects me as well. I didn t ever recognize race. it had nothing to do with anything. I have friends from all over the world and none of that ever kicked in  or affected me. now  everytime I see a commercial that is all one race or another I start twitching a little bit. cause its shoved in our face so much  its starting to effects me. not with real people I know or spend time with  but how I will instantly judge a commercial  or a show  or whatnot at the moment I see a few flags. I didn t use to be like that  but its become a hallmark of how badly written a show is. I really think this hyper focus is pushing everyone to see people differently and divide them. it would of never affected me before. never. the commercials Ive seen on hulu for instance  most of them I see pop up are woke  or wokish. like ... all racially homogenous away from primary group. the men are usually being shown something  in almost everything they are women. the fact that I even notice it is ... ridiculous. this affects so many things. so when you go back to watching older stuff  where you ve got a mixed bag but the story is good and it feels organic  its like taking a breath of fresh air on a mountainside away from a city. cool and refreshing and unoppressive.
precisely why he s one of my favorite superheroes.
there s only one God  and I pray to him every day  - clark kent
yezzir
and that part is sorely lacking in the dceu
yup alot of my friends only watched the man of steel movie and assume he s some type of Jesus allegory and having to explain this to them is starting to drive me mental do I basically explain it as he s the most human of us all dispute having more power than we can imagine he s still pure   clark kent is who he really is a small town boy trying to make a difference he s not a idolized man but the man we could be just as lex is a symbol of what we could also be the choice is ours
I lost interest in the dcu and the mcu  only really watch when there s nothing else to watch  even than its all just background noise  I get more from playing games than watching most movies series  in saying so alot of hollywood is just reboot after reboot.
all star superman is one of the best comics ever made
Ive got really high hopes for the upcoming cavill superman based on what he said.
I was a kid of the 70s and I enjoyed the hanna-barbera superfriends cartoons.  superman was my favorite in the dc universe.  then Christopher reeve as superman in 1978 just added more excitement.  I think stan lee said superman bored him since he had no character flaws or emotional issues  like spiderman did.  but I still go with the man of steel.  one of best scenes in movie was of course when lois lane died and he decides to go back in time to save her.  his father jor-el tells him that he is absolutely forbidden to love any human and must never use his powers for selfish reasons.  but kal-el does just.
I like dr-doom!
well said. its odd that the people that claim to be progressive can only see people based innate traits like gender  race or age. I feel like we ll never move past these issues until we can stop judging and categorizing people that way.  dont judge a book by its cover  seems to be lost wisdom these days.
a superhero who looks just like me   it is so patronising to black people.
@younger544  thats literally what the world has always dealt with and not necessarily a problem exclusive to today.
@stephen hogg  yes  but its also offensive to everyone else. spiderman has always been my favorite superhero. captain kirk has and always will be my favorite living human. Im not white. Im certainly not a genius who was bitten by a radioactive spider or the captain of a freakin spaceship! but it was never about who or what they were that I related to. this  progressive  garbage of today is nauseating.
@areg pone  agreed. but  how is it  offensive  exactly
@otterloopbyeah  such attributes were a foundation among black folks like myself. which has me thinking raising this generation on narcissism is deliberate. gotta keep us in line somehow.and what s sadder is this is directed at everyone of every race  both genders  and all sexual orientations.
imagine walking into the ghetto  and thinking youre entering wakanda.I dont think we have to worry about any of the kids who actually leave the house and see what our country is like. it took less than one minute on the south side of chicago to disillusion me about african utopias.
this is your opinion but it bothers me with white people over represented in movies
@jay real 24  as a black man who cares more about characterization than race  Imma ask  why
batman more selfless  he does all thatsuperman does but he s just a regular man going head first against Gods. helps his city as a philanthropist and hero.
@papa piker  it is funny. is there ever a single comic where he says thatsuperman believes in a higher power but not in any religion created on earth. he believes in rao-orthodox religion and even sometimes says  great rao!
punisher is better than superman and batman combined. he just kills all evil guys so people will not suffer because of them. by killing and taking a burden of murder on himself he makes the lives of millions of people better because they will never suffer from the actions of bandits and villains.
precisely why many  not me  consider superman boring.  his personality doesnt resonate with them and they dont understand his selflessness.  I guess most people are like lex and prefer batman as a human versus superman s humanity
superman is based off Jesus. superman makes mistakes. Jesus never has.  I ask people their top 3 most evil and its easy  hitler  stalin  mao  satan  some anime villian whatever.  I ask top 3 most morally perfect and its way harder. some people say superman but superman lies every day about his identity  he s murdered villians without authorization from the law. some people say buddha but he abandoned his wife and child to seek personal fulfillment. some people say martin luther king but he cheated on his wife multiple times. most honest people that dont hate God say Jesus and when I ask for number 2 they struggle to come up with anyone at all or dont know the history of the person they use. Jesus is the creator God  didn t have to incarnate but he did. knew he would be rejected and killed but did it for the salvation of the whole world. he had the power to destroy any enemy at any time but told us to forgive our enemies instead. his moral system is literally the foundation of modern ethics  whether people want to admit it or not . if his claims are true he will also eradicate all evil and create a perfect eternal paradise for those that choose his path. this is not even dependent on Christianity being true  this is just who Christ is.  some people are judged to be righteous based on one good deed or a career of good deeds. rarely do historians dive into the mistakes and flaws that drove righteous people to do good. Jesus is sinless from birth unto eternity. some people say children but children dont know what they are doing and are inherently selfish. george washington was a slave owner. mother theresa was a follower of Jesus. gandhI hated black people and slept with his niece. Ive heard muhammad but he had sex with a 9 year old girl. mr rogers but he was a follower of Jesus. what Im saying is good characters are always modeled after Jesus and people we consider good follow his teachings in one way or another. thats not to say average people dont do good things or make insane sacrifices but that doesnt make them the most moral people to have ever existed. plenty of scumbags will jump in front of a bullet to save a child. the story of Jesus is unique in that he demonstrates selflessness through his willful incarnation  life  his teaching  his death and resurrection  judgement  the creation and restoration of the universe. Ive heard plenty of people say  there are many legends just like that  ok name one or two. hercules killed his own family. krishna had sex with his married aunt. odysseus cheated on his wife. dionysus raped aura. we know nothing of zoroaster s life only his teachings. horus didn t create the world or get tortured to save it. you can say Jesus isn t good because he created hell but destroying evil isn t evil. allowing evil unlimited reign is evil. not punishing evil is evil. so in my eyes even the most wrathful  destructive  violent aspects of Christ are rooted in his absolute moral perfection. if Christ is perfect judge then to let evil slide is evil but if we are all evil then how can he save any of us and be just  punishment for evil must occur for there to be justice so Jesus took that punishment on himself. you could say  why isn t everyone forgiven then   because then evil has ultimate victory. hitler did nothing wrong if he will ultimately be forgiven and live in the same condition as the children he murdered. so if evil must be punished its proof that the judge is good.  forgiveness is given but on the condition of repentance and loyalty to the source of life  truth and righteousness. in this way evil is justly destroyed and mercy is justly poured out to those who deserve punishment.  Jesus is the most righteous person to exist in history and fiction.
@sandalio   based off Jesus moses actually. his origin is a direct 1 1 to the basket on the nile.
@papa piker  superman s religion is a weird case  he was raised Christian he still even in modern versions hold those values. but at the same time he is often written to also believe or hold the values of rao the kryptonian God.
@zarddin  I am pretty sure superman has said he was raised Christian and the kents were Christian and he has and maybe does go to church. he probably doesnt hold the same values or beliefs nowadays as most strict Christians do but still.
@zarddin  punisher has even said no one should idolize him. he knows he is not good or better. he isn t trying to be. frank is a broken man dealing with a broken vengeance. the argument for him being better is kind of null because the point of punisher isn t that he is better. its that he is a man on a quest for vengeance  justice and morality do not stand in his way. and to be fair superman helps out everyone with every problem. frank mostly just kills people. even random mooks who may or may not be the worst people alive or just some kid who is been selling some dope.superman s morals are clear  franks are neutral.
@zarddin  yet the marvel universe is still full of crappy people especially hell s kitchen so we never actually see franks impact unfortunately I suppose.
@sandalio  superman was mostly based off hercules and other heroic figures sure Jesus may have factored in but still.
agreed. for me  silver surfer gets second place.
@chandler burse  he was raised as Christian but he is not Christian. he did read the Bible and saw how much evil is in that book so he is happy that his parents and other Christians he did meet were the ones that were ignoring most of the things written in the Bible so he didn t have to fight against them. while thinking about Gods and religion he decided he thinks there is some kind of higher power but not a single religion on earth tells the truth or is connected to that higher power and that earth religions were created by evil people to control other humans. when he was searching for something for a religion that is as good as he is he noticed that all religions on earth are mostly evil and people who are good and believe in them are the ones that ignore what is written in Bible  tora  quran  until he found the holy book of raoism thatsurvived destruction of his home planet. rao-orthodox religion  also known as raoism for short  is the primary religion of krypton and new krypton. even super-girl follows that religion.
@chandler burse  punisher didn t want to be idolized that is true. but his actions of killing bad guys saved more people lives than batman ever did. superman probably saved more as he didn t let the earth to be completely destroyed or exploded on many occasions.
@sandalio  I love how Christians will want to spin a superhero to be their Jesus just so they can spin that web of lies only so they will be able to read the comics without feeling any guilt for not following Bible and reading comics.
@chandler burse  we as readers know that punisher makes the world a safer place by killing bad guys. police officers that are supporting him with the intel on the criminals they cant arrest or that have too much money to be prosecuted and found guilty knows that.only frank thinks he is not making any change because of how many bad people exists. the punisher knows that no matter how many hundreds or thousands of criminals he kills  it does not make a difference in the world. frank knows that his actions do not make the world a safer place.  heidegger  who took kierkegaard s philosophy further  comes even closer to describing the punisher   since we can never hope to understand why we re here  if there s even anything to understand  the individual should choose a goal and pursue it wholeheartedly  despite the certainty of death and the meaninglessness of action.  thats sure the punisher as I conceived him  a man who knows he s going to die and who knows in the big picture his actions will count for nothing  but who pursues his course because this is what he has chosen to do.  and most important even though he has stated several times that nobody should be like him  as toward a previous partner  rachel cole-alves   he has not a single regret about what he does  as shown during his fight with ghost rider when he withstood his penance stare without even flinching.
@sandalio  superman is not based on Jesus not that I d have a problem with that if he were . he was created by two jewish creators and his story is far closer to moses than Jesus.admittedly later in his representation by other Christian creators they may have had a Jesus comparison in mind  but he certainly wasn t  based on  him.
superman is boring overpowered generic good guy no depth. wolverine is much better as a hero because he s flawed and doesnt always make the best choices but he tries to do the right thing.
a hero is not  distinguished by power  but by what he does with that power. clark kent is the greatest hero as he embodies that. superman is not recognized by the powers  but by the man who wields them. if they exist or not  clark would still try to help anyone. because he is what humans should aspire to be   despite his dna not being human. whereas  luthor is everyithing wrong we should avoid  even though he has the same dna as humans.
@stabalot games  Imust say I love wolverine or punisher more than barman or superman or any other plotarmor guys.
@zarddin  this is however just fanboying over punisher and trying to put superman and batman down despite the fact their comics show they make change too. superman is someone frank would ve idolized himself as he idolizes captain america.
@zarddin  what comics did this stuff come from  can we get some sources.
@zarddin  you may want to look up what  plot armor  is.  plot armor  is when the plot changes to allow a character to survive a situation he would not  usually do under the rules and normal interactions of the world he exists under.for superman  plot armor  is almost impossible. his power set allows him to avoid situations like that and its been ages since the days of random abilities and characters having  not yet cemented in the zeitgeist. the closer to underpowered  the easier is for  plot armor  to come. batman has an easier time for something like that to sneak in. thats why superman stories are stories of larger than life threats or tales of morality. his character being unbroken is part of his core and  its a constant to him. to change that would be an actual break in his stories.superman has a very specific role   the aspirational hero . he exists  just like captain america  as the beacon for other heroes to follow. they help where they can and keep to their morals  indifferent of the pressure put on them. guys like punisher and wolverine  themselves  admit they fall short and are not role models. if they would be the limits  then the ones following them  would go even deeper in darkness and you would hit the villain area. doing evil is way easier for someone with a broken mindset  than doing good. thus a character like that would be sliding easier in actions like revenge  compared to justice.
reminds me of captain america
superman is the personification of the war on crime in my opinion. he knows its a fight that can never be won  but still needs to be fought regardless
@mastericeyy  I would think batman is that personification.
@chandler burse  I think batman is the personification of the impact of crime.
@mastericeyy  his entire existence helms on his war on crime. superman s existence helms on humanitys need for help.
@chandler burse  yes whilst batman s existence is wholly tied to him fighting crime. however batman only exists because of the impact of crime on bruce wayne.his character is quite clearly showing someone who has struggled to move past the damage and trauma that crime leaves on the innocent.
@papa piker  moses is a type of Christ. if Christianity is true God used the story of moses to foreshadow Christ. moses wrote about the messiah that would come that would be like him. deuteronomy 18 15-19. acts 3 17-22 makes this the official Christian position.
@chandler burse   superman s creators were jewish. I highly doubt that.
@zarddin  I dont read comics just the synopsis but there s no prohibition against it. paul read the works of pagan poets and used it to relate to his greek audience. you struggled to come up with someone better or close   also do I need permission to share my worldview
@simon barnett  if Christianity is true superman is based on Jesus because moses is a type of Christ. acts 3 17 -22 17  and now  brothers  I know that you acted in ignorance  as did also your rulers. 18 but what God foretold by the mouth of all the prophets  that his Christ would suffer  he thus fulfilled. 19 repent therefore  and turn back  that your sins may be blotted out  20 that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord  and that he may send the Christ appointed for you  Jesus  21 whom heaven must receive until the time for restoring all the things about which God spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets long ago. 22 moses said   the Lord God will raise up for you a prophet like me from your brothers. you shall listen to him in whatever he tells you.
@sandalio   moses is a type of Christ no. if Christianity is true... you literally just wrote heresy.
@sandalio  are youreferring to them basing superman on Jesus or hercules
teihen ryoushu no kanchigaI eiyuutan  is effectively their power fantasy though like the main character lack the intelligence to relise what is going on or what they are.
I agree. but my only thing is shouldn t the money well run out for these people  like its now proven that woke movies and writing is flopping probably worse than any time in cinema history  someone eventually has to say no thanks. I think places like wb is where itstarts and moves outward.
God and family  and demonstrating love and grace to as many as we can  is sorely needed in the world right now.
@zachorazor1  I dont think trump s family is proof that families and children make things worse like what lol. not every family is super rich and powerful and influential.
@chandler burse  yeah. it clearly was hyperbole. look it up.
I highly recommend  the english      starring native-american     indigenous actor   chaske spencer a brand-new tv series on bbc one two and can be viewed on bbc i-player
there was a period of time where all anime that ran on portugal s most popular cable tv kid s channel  called panda channel  were shoujo animes  from onegaImy melody  mermaid melody  kirarin revolution  magical warriors rayearth  sailor moon  jewel pet and fushigI yuugi. and as a preteen boy  I was hooked on those shows because I loved the drama  the character arcs  the growth  humanized villains and dark themes running in the background while still keeping the kid appeal  with strong female characters that rose to the occasion while having actual diversity in personalities.
shoujo animanga is for girls normally
@saro v  your point is that boys should only enjoy comics written and marketed for boys   girls should only enjoys comics written and marketed for girls   thatsounds terrible to me.  think of pixar animation.  they are made  for  children  but many of them can be enjoyed by adults.  thats a sign of good writing.
seriously. these writers are so self-absorbed  they cant be bothered to research or pull from the pantheon of characters created over the years. they only know self-insertion and subversion.
agreed
which actually breeds division instead of diversity when they teach people to focus on  the color of  their  skin  and not  the content of  their  character.
@shadowphoenix82  thank you ....why does itseem like humans as a collective are getting... dumber....
.....and now they are gonna attack you because you told the truth...thank you btw
time to try out biker mice from mars
k. love u cute girl
@skull monkey  Im not a cute girl.  but thank you. now want to love a cute girl
@himmelsdaemon  I agree  and understand is hard to teach  to people because they seem to afraid to think outside themself  I think what they believe in as love yourself  is just become  narcissistic  and thats how we got to where we are right now.
all of them came before marvel tho. but yeah I do agree  with what you said.
todd is basically a  manga artist  that was smart enough to keep his ip his so he controls what happens. a big problem is that other writers will ignore what you tell them to do and make something  they want  basically shoehorning their plots on a characters where it might not work. now add this on to 10  titles and now canon is in shambles.
excellent vod  mel! I hate identity obsession! I am also sick and tired of super hero movies because of how crap most of them have been for awhile. when a super hero movie gets announced that I think I will like I will of course watch it  but I ain t watching those crappy ones. ppl need to stop obsessing over identity and honestly also need to stop obsessing over a lot of other things as well. obsession is not healthy. I love your nails and hoodie by the way.
I actually didn t mind thatscarlet witch was the focus of the new dr. strange movie.  she s been one of my favorite mcu characters for a long time  and its not like strange didn t also have a big part in the movie.  the problem I had with that disaster of a movie was how much they butchered her character and threw away all character development she d had leading up to that point.  he dark turn made absolutely no sense for her character.  also  there was a super easy solution that didn t involve hurting anyone  find a universe where wanda had recently died but her children weren t yet aware of her death.  she could ve just covered up the death and step into that wanda s family life.
some really good points here. I liked the case you made with anime  especially since there s plenty of other really twisted things that come out of japanese culture and yet even they have a less selfish  self-centered worldview than most of the american creators we re suffering rn.
amen. well said! as a father of two boys  I am worried about a lot of the content that this woke people are putting on kids shows these days. I cant left them for a minute alone watching tv because of all the  check boxes  specially from the alphabet community. I decide when I ll talk with them about everything and thats when I see that they have develop their emotional maturity to understand all that. for now  let them be kids!!!
melanie  I dont know how Imissed your videos for 8 months  I enjoy your takes on pop culture. keep doing what youre doing!
watched black adam twice. it actually has gotten me excited to see what dc does next.
Im really grateful you have a voice online. we need more ppl like you.
Im in my seventies. when I look at contemporary entertainment Im aware that I have the biases that come with being from a long time ago. I concentrate instead on the quality of the writing. I look at character arc  consistency of the plot  verisimilitude  editing  the sorts of things a lit. major would still feel okay about critiquing. the mcu has become a waste of decades of fan love and an amazingly created universe. all they had to do was get in  turn the key and drive to new developments - they could even have raised our consciousnesses along the way if their work product was entertaining enough to carry that load. it hasn t been and attacking folks for not appreciating their shoddy work is the height of arrogant  self-absorbed elitism. we ll be watching old episodes of m.a.s.h. long after the current mcu is forgotten. thanks for your takes on these things  melonie.
great videolike I said before in another video  when it comes to representation  I d much more strongly relate to a character based on their personality rather than whether they look like me or notif I could only enjoy stuff that had characters who looked like me  that d kind of suck because there wouldn t be much I could watchI guess I could still watch elf  which is coolI also really like what you said about emulating a character instead of having a character emulate usone reason I really like certain characters is because I want to be more like them  they re how Im not  and it aspires me to be a better person youre absolutely right too about it becoming more like self inserts  look at how the scooby doo characters were changed to fit the race of the actorsalso how they made that character  I forgot their name  in umbrella academy be trans because the actor is
mel mel  I agree. making things about pure representation in any media has a lot more draw backs than just focusing on a story. I believe marvel and many things outside marvel dont know when they re doing to much representation. its fine to race swap something  bit give us a good story too. I believe when they race gender-swap someone they go  well how can we show that they are still a minority in this role  instead of going  we wanted to do something a bit different than the comics but make sure the story was still good . they mess up characters all to often because they strongly want to see there own ideals come to light. they want the clicks and feedback from there own people but literally dont give two craps about the audience. viewers come second to colleagues
the funny thing about the superhero genre is its been around for years  but itseems whenever someone mentions a storyline or a character trait thatsticks with them its all mainly older comics. they work more effectively to stick with people for generations because they didn t specifically focus on a certain topic to talk about  they used their story subtly to take their stance. and people would grow attached to it. spiderman for example works as a universally beloved hero that kids regardless of color can imagine themselves as spiderman  as stan lee said being fully in a mask it hides an identity anyone can be spiderman. so in turn what he stands by what messages he says through the story can be applied to anyone. whereas now I feel people are so focused on  the message  they forget the delivery of said message  so rather than create something lasting that canteach dozens of people even generations after it came out they d rather stirr up some headlines get people riled up for a couple weeks maybe a month or two and is then forgotten about. and seeing that all thr time gets tiring  I just want quality something enjoyable I can indulge escape from the world a bit and if I learn something along the way I do. not it being shoved in my face.
thank you so much for living out your faith and not being ashamed to share your moral values.  its so easy to let others bully you because of your faith  but to not let those individuals affect your life shows true strength.  great job!
it turns out avengers endgame was well named.
melonie  Im not Christian  but I agree with you about how the morals of the whole world have declined. it is hard to have any hope for humanity when it is urging its own demise. however  there are people calling out humanity on its bs and trying to halt it. I hope you get millions of subscribers because you are showing greater wisdom than most people on the internet nowadays.
identity obsession gotta use that word more often
yeah  I noticed that decline with comics  especially the spider-man comics. they got peter and mj back together in the 2018 run I was so happy about that  and now look where they are  they broke them up  mj apparently has kids with some random shmo and the worst thing is we still dont know why they split  its supposed to be a part of a big mystery to the run and they still haven t even addressed itsince  thats not drama  thats blue balls
an excellent video.am I tired of super heroes  no   not in the least.am I tired of watching my heroes   favorite characters turn into something their not or getting pushed out of their own story  movie  most certainly.am I tired of hero movies  noI am tired of perfect characters  with no struggles  who have the personality of cardboard living with genie plot inside the matrix. at least  I think this is the plot for most movies now.
I really feel what you saying about them using these female characters to relate to women. the funny part is the female characters dont keep  em around. a lot of this women on the fringe only tryna see it to catch a thrill. mfs practically threw a fit over namor s lack of a bulge. lol its only funny cuz I been on manga. so this mass exodus is just par for the course while people really play like they dont see the issue
I will say that I dont think the decline is the amount they are putting it out  much like you said about the political  they sacrifice good characters and good storytelling for agenda. when that happens... you are just like  screw it  Im done.  and like the things they did with she-hulk where the regularly insulted men  hulk and the like and just overall did a bunch of misandrist bullcrap. so  to quote someone else   without respect  we reject.
fans have  poor quality fatigue  not  superhero fatigue
great video melonie. Im glad you worked your faith into the video. so much truth from you today    have a wonderful day. good luck and have fun at the debate tomorrow. elon s announcement came at a good time to get practice on some of your arguments  huh
Ive been saying much the same thing on other channels.while there are plenty of people who will move on  the cultural and technological development that exists allows people to engage in different media long past the old expiration date.the reason why interest in western superhero figures is declining is because they re all narcissists  uber focused on shallow drama and romance.and romance should never be the focus of a superhero story. a supplementally part at times  but never the main narrative.
very well said. I like how you connected all these dots in such a way that even a leftist would see this and think  am I the a  hole
you hit the nail on the head. I am a believer as well  and I want to thank you for standing up for the Bible and for the true truth. it means a lot to know there are others out there like you.
I always come here for the hilarious reactions and then stay for the well spoken truth. well said  melonie.
I truly hope that level of navel-gazing we saw in she-hulk is not just how self-obsessed the average woman is nowadays.
Im blessed I saw this right before concluding my eighth view of evangelion. itstrikes me that a lot about thatshow revolves about the theme of self and other. man is man s worst enemy  and the solution seems  at first  to be complete assimilation  total dissolution of distinctions  classes  genders  individualities  identities  and conflicts in a giant melting pot of lcl.itstrikes me that this road to hell is paved with good intentions  after all  who wouldn t want to put an end to pain  to suffering  division  conflict  and inferiority  however  the entire message of that program was rejecting this assimilation. it is actually very selfish  even narcissistic  to demand that everybody sympathize  to claim that everything must be subjectified until there is no other and no disagreement  to return into the womb  to be alone  so that there are no enemies to fight  but just projections of the self  and  so  no heroes  either.I cannot deny it any longer  this is what is at the heart of  wokeness   trying to escape the hardship that is life by making everyone the same. itseems like sympathy and good intent  in truth  its sociopathy  because the human life needs conflict. we must all reject that project if we re to survive.your video is kin to that in spirit. even though at times I found you quite naive  it was because I saw a lot of my own optimism in you. you are right  of course  that hollywood and  by extension  modern life  is full of satanists and egoists. they claim that they are helping people by enforcing tolerance and sympathy  by deconstructing heroism  and by turning evil into something of a joke or a projection of the self.  no one is truly evil  since we re all the same.  what they forget is that not everyone is you.your video acknowledges the road to hell without renouncing good intentions altogether. for that  I salute you.    r.g.
Im not referencing her appearance at all when I say this but mel is as much of an angel that we have left in this world. God bless her
you are right! there are already tons of great female mcu characters. they could make a pheonix-centric series. they could even stretch thatseries into six movies! if they did thatseries right  it would be so good! the first three films being the phoenix saga and the second three films being the dark phoenix saga. I would also love to see an x-23 series. laura is a great character! she was already introduced in logan also. if they did it correctly  I would also enjoy a she-hulk movie series. there are so many great female marvel characters. as far as writers authors go  patricia briggs  author of the ny times best selling mercyverse novels is one of my favorite writers. she really knows how to create both male  and female characters. we need more writers like her writing these movies. they wouldn t be  woke  stories. sure  she does write gay characters  like warren  the gay werewolf. however  he is only one character  and the story doesnt revolve around him  and his partner. both he  and his partner kyle are awesome characters! Im ranting lol. Im done lol.
damn  mac dropped the mic on this one...
shame is like fear and pain. we need all of these things to keep us safe and propserous. some of us need these things to even feel alive. sure they sound negative  but even a loveless punch in the face builds character.
one of my favorite genres to watch are those japanese samuraI flicks  most of them pretty old.  yojimbo... zatoichi... musashi... 13 assasins... blade of the immortal  etc.  what they all have in common is that none of these characters look anything like me.  not a damn one of them.  I dont  relate  to them for the most part.  and thats ok.  Im interested in their character  what they do  how they do it and their morals  or lack of them .  thats what makes them interesting to me  not whether they  look like me  or not.
hey melonie!!! hope youre doing well
I remember reading the original secret wars comic and there was a scene where iron man was hurt so had to take off his arm-armor. its james rhodes in the armor and he looks at captain america and says something like  I bet you didn t expect it to be a black man in the armor . captain america isn t shocked and says  I knew there was a man in there  I didn t care about color . thats the way Ive always related to people in that I dont care about skin color  I care about the heart and quality of the person instead. but all these years later  in a time when we should have our shit figured out with each other  there are too many people saying color is the most important thing. the mcu is obsessive that this movie is  representational  but it only really has people of color so  no it isn t. we get called racist if we tell people we just want quality writing and not movies where the only thing important is the color of the cast and director. too many people scream  representation  and  equality  but close the door to most of the people who want to join the celebration.
I think self obsession equals pride and Ive seen pride destroy people.
I thought in terms of relatability it came from personality  not how someone looks. Imean I relate a lot to mel. initially it was based on tomb raider  but then her views on life at times are relatable. and Im not a woman. Im not white. Im not american. I dont need someone to change her into a british mixed race guy to find mel representing me
you were preaching during that last part. Imean that in a good way. all you said was truth. and entertainment aside  a lot of this stuff is spiritual  and you broke that down in a very simple and common sense way to understand. Im sure even people who may not even know the Bible that well may understand the simple points you were making in contrast to the faulty issues of the other agenda.
exactly  its not superhero fatigue. its shitty  non-sensical writing fatigue focused on characters  identities that we really dont care about.
I have been watching your channel for a while now and enjoy the content.  I liked thor in the marvel universe and enjoyed most of the mcu movies chris hemsworth was in.  but I kind of figured thor love and thunder would be bad so I never watched it.  its a shame because ragnarok was really good.  guess taikka waitittI really wanted to destroy him  though.  off topic here  but I like your sweatshirt.  I grew up in western pa as a kid and like the steelers myself.   but this year is so awful that I cannot follow much.  they should have fired matt canada after last year and at least picked an average offense coach who has a playbook with more than 5 plays in it.  pickett even said they expect to win by calling the same plays over and over again.  at least shoe some ability to change.
thank you. you basically said everything I was thinking. I shared it to my fb page
thoughtful comment. I particularly admire the turnaround in paragraphs 2 3. now Im only 7 episodes into evangelion  but I know this refutation from my studies in philosophy  heraclitus to parmenides no  the world is not one and the same  perfect and unchanging  it is in fact made of change  because life is by nature full of struggle  ever in flux  forged and defined through its conflict aristotle to plato  no  our existence is not found and exalted in the degree to which we embody the ideal  rather the ideals are sought and honed through our experience of the real  changing  imperfect world we find ourselves in.what we ve got today is a bunch of platos running around pretending to believe that all is one  that every individual is identical  while at once obsessed with the differences in group identity. for instance  race is a construct  artificial and meaningless  yet you could never understand the experience of a person of another race. aristotle would never stand for such transparent inconsistency  and in his spirit I will synthesize the solution as follows.the truth is that everyone is human  and although we each have our own experience  they can be shared understood  by talking listening as equals  not as identities  just as people.
its a self fulfilling prophecy  once the characters have no semblance of humanity the only reason you d watch them is because they superficially look like you
you are so right on the money  girl! speak it!
I always imagine that there was a totally different version of dr strange  multiverse of madness  thatscott derrickson wrote. probably had a more raimI feel to it  with mordo dying in the opening scenes  killed by a full blown scarlet witch. rest of the movie would be similar except for non-evil mordo helping strange  and being given help by the illuminatI  etcnot to hate on the actress  but america chavez  a lot like rirI in wf  just dragged the movie down imo.
absolutely spot on. I think they know they cant pull the numbers with a movie called jane love and thunder so they just called it thor. hawkeye barely is about hawkeye. so many of these shows you just turn off because they re bait and switching you with the content. its a shame because it has nothing to do with race or sex. we love ripley in alien and aliens. we love laura croft. trinity in the matrix. mace windu  black panther  chad boseman   blade  the lists can go on and on.its a shame that instead of creating a story that draws you into a fictional world or believable story they try and push political correctness for some strange agenda.
they have control of all their characters now I think except the spider-man stuff so why not feature mockingbird  agent carter  domino  jessica jones  dagger  medusa  with hair   nico minoru and gwenpool instead. there are mutants who have had their own books while not really associated to x-men  those would be a good way of introducing mutants to the mcu like x 23 and dazzler.
awesome commentary. great stuff. I really dont need to see myself in a story about an alien civilisation. I really do need to see a compelling narrative
about this whole fatigue thing...I want anime and got my trashy isekI love...every time I see a new  good isekI Im getting annoyed that there is another isekI but the moment I start watching it I cant stop this is what happen when you get a good show it remove any fatigue you have cause its good
I think its important to re-emphasize for something to be diagnosed as a psychological disorder it has to impair the individual s normal functioning. this is true for all disorders. if you have anxiety obsessive thoughts depressed mood etc. but it does not get in the way of relationships  work  school  etc. then you technically do not have a disorder. thats not to say you cant seek help for it though.
when it comes to gender bending an established character in a beloved franchise  and doing it right  I point to the battlestar galactica reboot. by switching starbuck and boomer to female characters allowed for many new avenues to explore good story telling and character development and organically introduce romance in the high tension situations the characters find themselves in. it was masterfully done and I recommend anyone to experience the series from the beginning with as few spoilers as possible  yeah  I know its old now . heck of a ride.
happy birthday melonie  I hope you have a wonderful day with family also all the best for your year ahead   keep on killing it  from england
this girl makes a decent amount of talking points for someone talking about movies and tv. damn girl you are a great listen!
really  happy I found your channel   I love your positivity   love from canada
that part on religion is 100  true and how everyone is focused on self. you were spot on on everything you said. there s a reason this stuff is not working and they just dont see it.
in the first season of westworld antony hopkins said that people doesnt go to the park to know their self  they go be another person. and this the same to movies an tv shows. we dont want to see a clone of yourself in the screen. we want to be that character that is badass or has a lot charisma.
great video melonie!!! I like the longer ones
new video!! and the steelers hoodie!! hope youre having a great day  melonie.
its not for anyone specifically its just about the message. edutainment   the  teaching you better  as it tries to be fun.
14 30 ur right about that for sure. I wish it was all people because then u have some who share and talk about black people being represented in anime either they re saying how they re being racist or that there s not many black characters. or someone would say there is  enough  black characters and then glorifying and praising it that has the same vibe as the  representation  kind of thing.
people go to the movies to escape reality.
you can write very well done carbon copy charactersred daughter of krypton is a very good story about supergirlshe s essentially 15 year old blonde haired blue-eyed superman as a womanbut I think there are stories of hers that are written very wellalso if you look at the second injustice game I think her character is written very well therealso it was only one episode but I think she was pretty awesome in that one episode you see her in in superman the animated seriesthe answer isn t to have female characters that are almost ripoffs of your male charactersyou have to have them have their own personalities though their own story their own come up their own struggles their own character arc something that makes them who they are so when you see them outside of costume or even in costume you dont see them as just another carbon copy rip offa really good way to have done that with ironheart was to keep julia starkbut disney led a bunch of people on social media bully a seven year old girl because she wasn t black enough to be really williamssorry to burst your bubble but you cant have your cake and eat it too social justice idiotsif it has to be rere williams then you have to leave all of the other characters alone which means youre not allowed really williams youre only allowed people like black panther luke cage storm icon blue marvel so on and so forthImean there s some good ones in there but you know black lightning static shock so on and so forthbecause you d be blackwashing thenoh wait thats not how it worksthen guess what julia stark would have made more sense julia stark would have literally been I believe tony stark and pepper potts daughtershe would have been a perfect iron heart if you would have instituted a time jump say 10 yearsmatter of fact Ive even written fanfictions that I believe would have made a lot better since then these idiots writing and you know what my writing is not very fucking goodwhat Im trying to say isits not thatsimple
about the quality of writing in hollywood - surprising how you can still find good writing in indie or arthouse films  however they do not get the marketing or exposure from mainstream media. how many great a24 were overlooked because just none of the  critics  decided to post about it in his platform.

thank you so much!
I feel supergirl is somewhat important to establish that kal-el is not as alone as he thought. that krypton is not as dead as he feared. that krytonians can still live on in some form both with pure blooded and half blooded ones like his son.
I dont necessarily think there s anything wrong with having a  message.  every decent story ever told has a lesson to be learned or an idea to take away from. the problem is that all of these recent  messages  have been used to push a  most of the time  false political standing for a certain group in society  painting an image thatsimply isn t true.
when content takes priority over art. thats what the mcu has become.
100  spot on!  and bonus points for rocking the steelers gear!  I knew you were a lady of good taste!
people want to feel that this is all leading to something. so far all we know is that at some point this will all go back to kang but we dont get since of urgency to get to the over arching story.
early 2000 s    you know  Im something of a scientist myself.  modern m-she-u    you know  Im something of a global warming activist woke feminist myself.
hey melanie I usually dont comment but I have to say that this segment actually made me proud but in a healthy way Im just glad youre standing up for the Bible and his word. I agree with everything you said about the Bible and how basically the left is doing everything that is opposite of. do youremember this quote  you just do you   all that loving yourself talk and promotion is the downgradation of american society we are all now teaching ourselves how to be our own God basically really really sad one of the first things I learned after being saved is you give up of yourself you have to grow smaller and God to grow bigger to make an impact on yourself and the world keep the faith girl we are as Christians being attacked as bigots racist or whatever they want to call us keep on fighting the good fight Jesus loves you
great points. marvel has almost become a parody of itself... sidenote  doing something different with your makeup  I like it. its on point!
you have a good message  you can make a change I wish you luck young lady.
while I do agree with you for the most part. the scarlet witch as played by elizabeth olsen is phenomenal she is in my opinion a great actress.  now as far as dr strange. they did make him a little silly.  and the way they have dumbed down thor and made him immature is sad. I did not like love and thunder at all.
the more drivel the mcu spits out  the more I feel like they may not like me all that much
I know the comics. I see the contempt for the creators  the work  the fans. never again with any disney product  I intend to watch disney die.
the love connections interest that were there often made sense  and were written well  or atleast some what better or with the right itentions. I remember how we back in 2009 were constantly   visciously attacked for being perves   enabled real life rape for liking lara croft  sara pezzinI  storm  tifa etc etc. here we are anno 2022  where these puritans are constantly pushing for softcore and or hardcore erotica being added to the stories. of course they always conviently forget how most women behave from their teens years   up to fictional and real live goodlooking men. boybands are a great example of this  or the way how women all over the globe publicly   online went crazzy over the two guys from twight light. and had no shame displaying their thirst in ways I never have seen men do  nor would any men would get away with just 1  of how mad women can get over male fictioonal characters  actors  singers  athletes etc etc. your right  this article is written with a soft landing  so they dont have to say out loud what the real problem is. cause this fatique clearly isnt the  natural fatique  when corps milk something to death.
Im just happy someone came out and said it. both in americantopic and japan topicand thank God  melonie came out and unloaded the nonsense thats in american written superheroes today.and it hurt too... seeing what stan lee created be ripped apart...comics were created to enjoy the imagination  of the world of these characters.crazy how people like  rodolphe topffer  the grand dad of comics... who gave us the start of comics and great creators like  dc  malcolm wheeler nicholson and stan lee  marvel now look what it comes to now....
I love how woke agenda and race and sexuality and gender is more important now than good writing and interesting story.and how it is so hard for them to create any interesting superhero based on woke agenda to a point that they have to kill gender swap existing characters and even then they fail and they blame fans.
interested on your take on the candace cameron bure issue.
the most important super-hero movie next summer is mission  impossible 7. ethan hunt  represent!
its called empathy that people lack. this can be increased by reading books and watching shows about characters that are different from yourself  putting yourself in their shoes.I love science fiction fantasy that involves aliens and fantasy races that aren t even human  and I can still relate to their plights and decisions. Im personally part of at least 2 minority groups  and I do not want need more representation of those things in media  one being neurodiverse .in addition  I am reminded of this scripture that encapsulates the attitude of today s entertainment industry  woe to those who say that good is bad and bad is good those who substitute darkness for light and light for darkness those who put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter!
example  simple but to the point. look at bleach and ichigo. his only motivation for gaining power is to protect people he loves or cares for.  key word  mamoru . does it matter sado yasutora is black brown  no! it has never mattered  does it matter that yoruichI is black and soifon has hots for her  no. if anything its a tertiary plot point.a lot of things that happen in bleach stories is about characters doing things for others. which is partially why bleach has been such a hit.
speaking straight facts in this
I wanna live in a world where disney didn t buy marvel
people will never get fatigued of good quality entertainment. the people crave good entertainment. the people are getting fatigued of bad stories that repeat the same 3 woke eye-rolling cringe predictable plots centered around gender  race and sexuality.
and the lokI series starred his female counterpart  the titular character being a side kick and a joke.
I feel another issue that adds to superhero fatigue is that marvel has kinda gotten a formula so all the series or movies feel the same. whereas with comics sure first off they re superheros  but the tone the other genres mixed in is different from one another they each still havr their own unique identity. the vibe and writing for captain america is gonna be different from thor which is different from punisher to the x men. I feel if directors  could have a little more fun you d have some unique takes on superhero movies. you could have a grungy street crime type lets say punisher movie  but still then have a lighter hearted spiderman movie. the movies right now consist of the smart allic who always has a witty one liner to say primarily knocking a costume saying  what me wear that  uh uh oh no thats stupid .
they chose the absolute worst time to do all this too when people were already starting to be brunt out on hero stories.. just gives us another reason to turn it off
everyone is very self absorbed but thats what happens when satan has his dirty nails in every aspect of our societal existence. go stillers! melonie is a yinzer fan
when you hate the  hero  more than any of the villains  then there s something very wrong.
I love it when you post long videos that are 20  min. the last time you posted a 20 min long video was on oct 1st.
winter soldier is too accurate to reality  they dont want to make another one of those.
mcu is quantity over quality now.
strong characters aren t characters that are physically strong  unerring  perfect do-gooders. they re well-written characters. there just aren t many of them anymore. I believe thats what people are tired of. they re tired of yet another completely forgettable waste of time.
speaking of what I have watched. obi-wan was ok  quite a bit of meh but not horrible. tales of the jedI was really enjoyable lots of interesting moments and very well done.andor right now is doing it for me. the acting is great  the writing is sharp and the tone of the series is really showing how horrible it is to live under the empire.I haven t been able to bring myself to watch she-hulk  thor love and thunder  or wakanda forever since they have exactly what you ve described. someone s personal agenda and I have no interest in a movie or series that is built around that premise.
I totally agree with everything you said you are a very wise woman.
its almost like the people on twitter ranting and raving about identity aren t the majority of people  crazy. I wonder when disney will finally clue in
I kinda miss the verse of the day. I am not a huge Christian but it was something that was nice and unique to your channel. I use to skip some of them not going to lie but after you stopped I found myself going back to some of the old videos to listen to them.
thank you  and well said.
a man wrapped up in himself makes a small package indeed.
if you insult your fans and say  they should go away  and they go  you dont have fans anymore. maybe they will figure this out  even with their  superior  woke brains  that are thatsuperior  that there are nearly none overlaps with regular people s thinking
thanks for the video. please bring back the verse of the day. I really enjoyed that. God bless you and your family. duane.
I think the bigger problem is not the m-sheu but that they are hiring script writers based on race and gender instead of quality
wish they defy our expectations of them by making a decent movie
I feel the concept of blaming satan for all the problems in society is not even condoned by the Bible as humans are inherently sinful and are not at the whelms of lucifer entirely as far I understood.
he tempts but we commit.
the japanese made a great ironheart. if the mcu just kept going with that they would ve had a smashing success.
way to stand up for your faith in Jesus and your love for the Bible! this elevated my respect for you and your channel!
holy cow  the first video where shes not touching or  fixing  her hair every 5 secs hahaha
remember when entertainment used to be less about what genitalia the characters had  or were attracted to  and more about telling a story
thanks so much for your review!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
the companies have forgotten that people read comics to escape the real world issues
I admire the way you preach your faith. may God bless you and may he bring you joy  happiness and prosperity. mike
its sad how we re at a point where we re apathetic towards marvel now
the tv in my childhood home was monopolized by my younger brother and his stupid baby shows so what I did was use my tablet to watch full anime on youtube because back in the day anything and everything was on youtube  and then we got netflix which had a bunch of anime so I grew up watching anime and despite being black felt no need to be represented in fiction because why the hell would I want a mirror of real life.
I just started watching the boys  and that is so much more interesting
well said melonie.
one of the biggest problems these writers have is that they dont see how much empathy still thrives in people.  thats where their narcissism comes in  of course  because they dont get that they are projecting  and people are resonating. they project their hatred  and not much else  because thats all they really have. they are consumed by it. it fails so much  because people generally want to experience more than just hate and vanity. people took it for a little bit  but it doesnt sit well with most people  so the crowds thinned. thats my take on it anyway
getting fatigued   but black panther destroyed mid adam in 3 days
it would have been perfect if marvel did the same as quentin tarantino and only released a set number of movies and walked off on a high note  into the sunset after endgame.yknow  they would have died heros with people wanting more. that would cement marvels infinity saga in history as one of the most legendary feats of cinematic storytelling. and with perfect timing too  with endgame being released in april of 2019  the year covid first made its appearance.
just wanna say dammm youre hot but youre takes on all this nonsense makes you even more incredible just like anted to say that . hope youre weekend is a great one and as always keep pumping out this content its valuable and appreciated
lol  she called me  my siblings and cousin out  goku rocks
Im more hopefull of dc doing better
phase 4 mcu has had around as much content released as phase 2 mcu did. phase 3 had the most content released if we re counting all the movies  several seasons worth of agents of shield and agent carter  along with the netflix shows and hulu shows that were released during that era.
pretty great tangent imo. got some flashbacks to when you ended on Bible verses  which I always enjoyed .
you are absolutely right!
thank you so much! God bless you

I love it when you go on these tangents. especially when you bring God into the story.
just focus on your self  youre number 1  is good advice for somebody who is selfless and constantly taken advantage of... but if you ain t selfless  thats shit advice
let s update melonie mac for modern audiences! creates manlonie mac.
is it a superhero comic with romance  or a romantic comic with superheroics
youre my number one for super news.
its the  wokeness   the quality  and quantity. this is what disney does nowadays. it just milks something for all its worth and runs it into the ground. sadly  disney sees every franchise as a catalyst to deliver political preaching for the masses.
the reason marvel initially appealed to young fans was its hero were relatable.   peter parker is a normal teenager with normal teenager problems.  he s easier to relate to than a God from another planet.   marvel characters were more representative than dc s Gods and monsters.diversity isn t the issue.  neither is overtly political stories and characters.   the problem is that often wokeness takes precedent over story and character in modern comics.the x-men have always been a diverse team.  but storytelling used to be more important than showcasing diversity.
finally Im hearing someone talking sense
she hulk had potential as a more serious lawyer show  addressing supervillains and how laws and punishment would apply to them.  but instead its just dumb.  what mystifies me is when the companies are seeing revenues dropping  why do they continue to keep these bad writers around.
whats worse is you got genuine people like kevin conroy all them types of people are passing on. we got to sit with this content and nobody gives two craps about the characters they give to people. its about pointing the blame finger at you no matter what for random bull crap.
you know that whole love your neighbor thing  I tried that once. her husband didn t appreciate it.its a joke people. hahaha
yes  the woke crew are indeed some seriously narcissistic sorts if they need to see themselves everywhere they look  and maybe its because Im generation x  here  but...I fail to see the point of that. I totally have  dad bod  and I dont need to see that in my superheroes. humility is something I work at every day as well  and some days I do better than others  of course.
they didn t even want the true reI reI origin she didnt make her first suitshe stole it from tony stark lol
thoughtful video  especially near the end on the post-modern need for everyone to be valid and their identity to be central. whereas you articulate the disagreement in terms of your faith  I would  based on my studies in greek philosophy  frame it thus  heraclitus to parmenides no  the world is not one and the same  perfect and unchanging  it is in fact made of change  because life is by nature full of struggle  ever in flux  forged and defined through its conflict aristotle to plato  no  our existence is not found and exalted in the degree to which we embody the ideal  rather the ideals are sought and honed through our experience of the real  changing  imperfect world we find ourselves in.what we ve got today is a bunch of platos running around pretending to believe that all is one  that every individual is identical  while at once obsessed with the differences in group identity. for instance  race is a construct  artificial and meaningless  yet you could never understand the experience of a person of another race. aristotle would never stand for such transparent inconsistency  and in his spirit I will synthesize the solution as follows.the truth is that everyone is human  and although we each have our own experience  they can be shared understood  by talking listening as equals  not as identities  just as people.
they are destroying the brand by ideologizing  and they seem to have no intention of backing down. let them self-destruct then.
hImelonie may you have a wonderful blessed weekend  for everything u do for your incredible chanel takecare melonie
it was better when jon kent was getting close to saturn girl in legion of super-heroes  before bendis was stabbed in the back.
subscribing!  excellent video! thanks!
so guess this modern sensitivity audience is fatigued after barely one phase of movies made and marketed specifically for them
well said!!!
loool
I am pretty sure a lot of people cared and still care about the character conroy provided to batman.he is still considered the definitive batman to most fans  even modern ones.
I dont even think identity politics are a key. in general robert downey  chris evans and hemsworth had great arcs in the saga and its so anti-climatic and fartsy that they are replaced with any counterparts even if they were men. yea I know that happens in the comics too  but thats the exact point when the comics start to lose their readership as well and the only ones remaining are true addicts who pretty much read every single issue out of habit. plus if they didn t do thor 4  falcon and winter soldier etc. their calendar would be more open and the things coming would have more time and limelight. so they should just retire the certain archetype characters after they re done and go on with the unused ones. f4  blade  x-men  moon knight etc. could have carried the phase4 with doc strange  black panther  spidey  ant-man and others being in support. mix old and new  not just repaint the old with new paint and pretend  yeah we have a new iron man  but isn t itsad though tony stark died     but also we have a new iron man but as a woman so yea actually it doesnt matter if iron man dies because there are 10 million other good people in the world doing robotic suits that are just as good as tony s
you actually can represent everybody... the secret is just to focus primarily on who your characters are not what they are.what do they value  what drives them  what is their goal  why do they specifically want to achieve that goal  what would their utopia be like  what do they struggle with  who inspired or mentored them  what are their feelings toward that person and are they justified not  what color are they  what is between their legs  who do they think is sexy  why are they a progressive democrat even if democrats dont exist in your world  what outside force is taking away their agency and personal accountability  did their ancestors ever face persecution or mild disapproval
hell  you should see that page from an issue of teen titans that had a splash page of all the gay teen superheroes being controlled by one new character  made especially by a sjw writer  that was screaming at two straight  white male teen titans   they apologized...for being straight white males! !  the character controlling the gay characters was screaming at them for getting all the attention   that it wouldn t be happening anymore. that   they had superboy   flash holding hands for some reason...
having fictional characters make psa s is stupid especially when in the universe the character has the power to do something about it  mr enter
I vote both.
thank you for the ps5 melanie your too amazing cant believe I won
my rage isn t at marvel  its at you for being a steelers fan
I ll just watch the 90s sailor moon anime.  usagI s a ditz  a klutz  a terrible cook  keeps losing her boyfriend  and sees her friends die among a myriad of other problems  but she always gets back up and does the right thing.
I dont have marvel or super hero fatigue. I have bad marvel and super hero fatigue.
the biggest problem with the modern world is they have decided to push politics over a good story which is just really dumb  they could have won over far more people and got far less pushback if they continued to tell good story s with these new characters.a brilliant example of this is she hulk no sane person can look at thatshow and say with a straight face that it was a good show its story was appalling at best  they could have done some really interesting things with the story of a person that becomes a super but wants to carry on trying to be normal but instead they try to play it for cheap laughs that aren t funny  it also kinda didn t help that they already took away one of the things that made the she hulk character unique by letting hulk be able to control his power and in the first episode of her show they showed thatshe didn t have full control of it  then later in the show they take something else away from her when they make her a crap lawyer who can only win cases by accident and has to have legal terms explained to her.I was literally starting to think the writer on the show hated the character and where trying to deconstruct her  but that would mean the writers actually bothered to learn who and what the character was first.
superman with some spare time could gather up a lot of this trash polluting the earth  use some super ability to fuse it all and throw it into the sun.  but  go ahead and spend some time as clark to pine after lois and then go show solidarity by holding a protest sign.  plus Im sure he has access to a kryptonian library that might contain knowledge to help clean up the planet.
someone only needs to watch andor and she-hulk to see the difference between a very well written immersive story and a hot mess. andor is written for mature people to enjoy while she-hulk caters to short attention spans. Im totally shocked that both of these shows are on the same streaming service.
m-she-u... it is not being marketed to me.
fatigue . you know how freaking happy I would be if I could say that all those shows and movies were good products. this year would ve been an absolute win but we everything in phase 4 was mediocre except for spider man. thanks sony
hail the rippaverse!
I think I could watch youread a phonebook. lol
spot on mel
1000 percent agree
literally- I cannot with these new dc comic writers. jon kent  the  gay superman   in his original adaptation was amazing! he s like a 10 or 12-year-old kid  full of wonder and energy  who just figured out his dad is superman  and is learning how to control his powers. he was witty  charming  wholesome  adventurous  lovable- just a breath of fresh air! since he was a young kid it gave him much room to grow! and honestly was one of my favorite characters... especially in supersons! a story where damian wayne  batman s biological son  around the same age as jon  as robin  and jon kent as superboy  work together and have their own little team! the dynamic between the two was amazing  and they bounced off of each other in such a fun and entertaining way.now they decided to age jon up  take away any semblance of the character he was before  and just turn him into an lgbt  symbol . like- dc. if you want to have a character who is pandered to specifically an audience that is lgbt  and you want a character to be the face of it  just make a new character! make a character who can have their own journey and character development! dont just write over our pre-established beloved characters for the sake of being woke! in my mind  the current  gay superman  isn t the real jonathan kent  and its just a crazy parallel universe mix-up. because I need to believe that in order to not ruin my perception of this character.
marvel s next superhero d-bag man!
this is kind of a weird point since superheroes have been used to advocate for things since their very conception. not to mention how can superman fix racism  or spider-man stop sexism  they dont just have a power of undoing that.
haha what an honor. thank you
@melonie mac go boom  thanks for the reply and Im not kidding. I listen to you to calm my mind.
in all honestly damian wayne was never a favorite robin and my God batman has too damn many kids now they need to stop for awhile at least. now he has duke.
anime always has shown men and  women as strong and weak .the determining factor is the person at hand. they even have many weak types overcome their insecurities and weaknesses. which is why I fee we gravitate toward anime. present time look at denjI how he s evolving in chainsaw man. past pick any classic anime. namI from one piece starts off weak gets stronger because she wants to and works towards it.  the us honestly seems like they watch 5 mins of anime and then go make shows. they dont actually watch the entire show or at least represent the entire story.
my favorite part is where the new ironheart armor looks like a gobot transformer toy ages 2 to 5..its that underwhelming and cheap
well if they will insist on pandering to 1  of their audience and somehow expecting this to generate enough money to cover the other 99  that they ve alienated then they get what they deserve. all these companies  not just disney.
I dont think people are truly tired of super heroes  period. I think they re tired of the conveyor belt super hero products we re getting  disney being the biggest offender  here. we re getting generic movies and shows  or movies and shows that  deconstruct  the subjects of their movie show  which is also becoming generic now.people will go see a super hero movie that feels like the people making it really understood the source material  because that usually means the people making it are passionate  and passion really shows in art. people  both new and old fans of super heroes  liked the first wave of marvel movies because they were fun and well-written  made by a team of people that really cared about what they were doing.
I identify as a possum! I want more possums in the mcu!
tangent was on point!
the Bible did say that the people will grow to be lovers of themselves  dont let the overthrow you
why wouldn t it make sense for superman to be protesting
the best example if black people can have great lead role is django. amazing piece of cinema with great story and touching sensitive slavery in usa topic. I am white man but really like main character.
check out one click talking about her interview with g4
superman red son kind of gives a reason why superheroes cannot just fix all of our problems. its simply not always a viable idea. the more we depend on them  the bigger control one has to have over us. comics in a way are trying to say  at least with supes  that humanity needs to strive to be better on its own. it cannot look to the sky and hope for someone to make all our issues disappear and no thats not me trying to take a jab at religion. it also undermines lex luthor s greatest point against superman that he is a horrible being for existing on earth just due to the fact his entire existence encourages people to never try harder.by superman not only helping humans as much he feels he should and can  while he also encourages humans to help themselves and show them how.  its also especially apparent coming from an alien being who also had a planet that as far modern versions or even older ones go I think was destroyed due to its own populace ignoring the problems with it  itshows that luthor is wrong. superman has a greater purpose to be a lapdog that rescues us.
I ll be honest  I have been getting annoyed with the direction marvel has been going lately. falcon and the winter soldier was the last really good thing I remember liking  that being said  I rather liked the new black panther. granted I was disappointed at race messaging but I feel like both panthers have it in the back burner enuff that it doesnt big down the story like she hulk s gurl power crud did. so I liked black panther 2 more than I thought I wud  basically what Im saying
mcu is epic
the more we become a society that insists on everyone getting what our feudal elite masters say we should want  the less happy  the less productive  and the less successful we are.  this neo-feudalism where we are the peasants and the elites who think that they are our betters have control over what we get is a horribly destructive societal system.I want to do nice things for other people  sometimes at an actual expense to me  but it is okay because it is my choice. thats how itshould be.
speaking of chris hemsworth the supposed news around him taking a break from acting because of alzheimer s.. if true starts to make me wonder why so many people are having issues with such medical conditions or are they just reporting on it more
the mcu may be falling downhill. but something has awakened. the transformers are back baby!
as a black kid growing up I never favored black heroes  superman and spider-man were my top 2 hands down. meanwhile  the biggest black panther fan I know is a white kid from the suburbs  he s been collecting everything tied to the character since he was introduced to him in 2005. what s cool to you is what s cool to you  the idea thatseeing yourself is what resonates with you is only true for those that didn t get enough validation in my eyes
ah  yes  super hero love interest  someone to be kidnapped  lied to or murdered.
I still think  fatigued  is the wrong word. thats the word mainstream media and professional critics used when the fanbase pushed back against the tone shift of the star wars saga. thats what they said when people started dropping doctor who in record numbers because the series turned preachy and condescending and the writers took a big steaming dump on lore and continuity.people aren t fatigued with franchises  they re fed up with people using franchises they love as vehicles for their own ideology and self-insert fantasies. I still love star wars  doctor  who  he-man  thundercats and super hero action movies.I didn t stop watching the latest offerings because I got fatigued with the genre or topic  I stopped watching when the writers  actors and pr people responsible for making these shows started telling me to my face that they weren t for me.I cantell where Im not welcome.
when you trade story quality for the message
and good for you for realizing the reality and strengthening your faith in the face of it all.  keep growing stronger and better and healthier melonie!
are people seriously gonna start saying  acting or disney causes alzheimers  now. if they do they just give us another reason to force thatspacex dude to get us to mars.
@chandler burse  Im just wondering why in the past 2 years or so more certain medical conditions have seemed to spring up and been more prominent then what they used to could be just that there s more reporting on it but alzheimer s is a thing you would generally think for someone who s at a retirement age there are rare cases of juvenile alzheimer s in children which is tragic but adults seemingly reporting medical conditions that 2 years ago were not thought of becoming more of a general thought just seems strange
@mizen barbarossa  I am pretty sure this is due to media and information being so easily accessed. people claim autism is on the rise due to vaccines and other bullshit claims but the fact is there was a lack of proper autism diagnosing in the 70s and 80s then there is now. somethings similarly have a correlation but it is not confirmable nor fully viable just by a random study or such. and likely I would say its more or less media coverage than that actual acting causes memory issues. potentially it may not help since acting can affect someone psychologically but I doubt its a causation.
@mizen barbarossa  alzheimers is common among elderly yes but its still a disease and problem that has negative effects and I think theres a difference between someone becoming just senile where they have some trouble remembering things than lacking the ability to remember anything cohesively at all or being stuck in a time period of their memories.
this is why luffy and zoro hates to be seen as a hero
whoever wrote that article did statistics and all these sidelines  but still doesnt get why people slowed down with marvel movies... we are not watching marvel for agendas or to be programmed... we watch it to not be reminded of the world around us  but to escape the world around us...
ya its really funny melonie there are a ton of female professional sports fans.
marvel just went downhill since endgame. its pretty difficult to top what the infinity saga had created  being nicely woven into each movie in some form or fashion  slowly painting a picture of something bigger which led up to a really fantastic climax in infinity war endgame. I haven t watched any of the disney plus shows but nothing has peaked my interest or had glowing reviews from reputable creators like melonie or the drinker  secret invasion with samuel l jackson is the only exception  from the trailer  I have slight hopes thatseries wont be a complete flop and may be worth getting a 1 month subscription after its been released  to binge it and cancel
I would rather have a bad movie than one that yells at me that I am a crap person. at least one is trying to do its job.
dc isn t perfect  but at least the do a better job than marvel has been doing to put out consistently good products. that they are starting to be more selective may be the reason why.
Im not fatigued because of the amount  Im fatigued because of the content. I realize that my personal experience may differ from others  but I would dare say that most people would prefer the mcu to go back to the way it was before the woke agenda kicked into hyperdrive.
we need you on the nerdrotic channel
western culture is very self-oriented. whereas japanese culture is group oriented. the west preaches to be proud of yourself  flaws and all. japanese culture is about keeping harmony within the group.
the mcu hollywood is technically the wnba now
superman s job isn t to protest climate change  thats captain planet s job.headline from the daily planet   nobody cares about captain planet  by clark kent.
there s a series on netflix called  uncoupled   and it was advertised in the marketing as  a series that is not just for gay people  but for anyone who needs a fresh start .yes  the series has a homosexual protagonist  most of his friends are homosexuals too  but the series is not classified as  woke   in fact  it presents itself as a normal series .. only with a gay protagonist.I was curious enough to see if it really wasn t woke... and I was pretty surprised. the series is about a gay guy  but it is not  a woke advertisement   they built the series like any other series  and the result is that the character conveyed empathy and maturity... something that we dont see in woke movies.and I think studios will look at this series and realize that woke bullshit actually gets in the way of stories  and they will probably start to change strategy.
canthe mcu recover with the thunderbolts and deadpool 3  mabey but they ll never recapture what they had for the last decade.
decline in the number of professional writers.  rise in the number of professional social media content creators.  coincidence   why bother getting a job to write  when I can say what I feel into a face cam and get paid more
I am a comic fan and long story short  that thing that claims to be she-hulk in the mcu is not she-hulk.
people are just becoming exhausted from the wokeness coming out of marvel
I have absolutely no superhero fatigue. however  I definitely have bad movie fatigue. the best phase 4 movie was spiderman  no way home  and itstill wouldn t make my top 10 mcu films.
shurI bp  ironheart   mighty jane  she hulk  ms marvel   echo  ms hawkeye    we got moonknight and a killed off t challa.  I feel like antman is gonna die. dr strange too! setting  up his replacement
I really dont think they are doing this for anyone... probably they are doing this to rewrite a history where future generations look back at these super heroes and see the female and feminist versions of all of these reboots
people miss the mcu. not sure what this stuff they re excreting now is  but it isn t the same mcu that built up to and culminated with infinity war
yuuup
the truth is  none of the complaints would matter if the a action was good  the politics is overshadowing the powers of the heroes themselves
race and gender swapping isn t the problem.   keep in mind that heimdall was race swapped all the way back in the original thor movie.but youre right.  the decline in quality is the cause of the fatigue.  the probelm with ironman 2 was the story was weak.  the movie was more concerned with setting up avengers.  too much focus on future projects at the expense of storytelling is the main problem. wakanda forever wasn t bad because it was female focused.   it was bad because they wasted time setting up iron heart  the thunderbolts  and the dora milaje spin off.
doctor strange and the multiverse of inconvenience
gee  Im so glad that batman is around so all those billionaire geniuses with ptsd can feel represented.said no one ever.
I agree with your take and I love those big brown eyes
I understand the anger with the mcu  but have youread iron man or ironheart. rirI was created by a white guy who s a legend  brian michael bendis. lionheart is iron man s robin. there s a reason why they are looking for a new tony. rirI wasn t intending to be a hero. she was only trying to find the people who killed her stepdad. tony was impressed and used her as his hands in the real world while he was growing a new body.
if it wasn t for anime being so good at avoiding  the message  it would be so much more frustrating seeing all these characters and stories butchered to push their social programming.  thankfully japan is decades behind on the wokeness for now.
that look like me . vanity pure and simple. little kids dont give a crap about representation  if they rock with the character they will pretend they are that character. its adults that are grooming children to fit their twisted beliefs.
the boyz is still my favorite super hero series  even though later seasons are getting a bit cringey.
I think they did both wanda and dr. strange dirty in the sequel...
hollywood has always race bended black  latin  asian  middle eastern and native american characters since its inception. none of those ethnic groups complained or protested about the above. the only ones complaining about  race bending  are the ones who have had  thousands of characters that represent them for the last 200 years... there are plenty of non white characters that content should be made of without race bending the white ones. but let s be honest  superman s an alien from another galaxy and ariel is a mermaid. they are fairytale characters that could honestly be black  green or purple. race bending them shouldnt be a big deal. just saying. always peace!!! keep shinning and dropping dope ass content!
people are just over woke super heroes and people that would rather make up a new background thatsucks over the background of the original superheroes
so much for judging by the content of a character  instead the younger generations judge by skin color and lack imagination.
I grew up in the 70s reading marvel and dc comics. the crap both brands  especially marvel  is putting on film is unrecognizable. especially when it comes to the personalities of the characters.I stopped watching after the last avengers movie. paying money to see traditional male characters get humiliated and pummeled by their female counterpart ain t my thang.
I saw this nonsense on the news the other day  where some people are calling their born babies  theyby . a term used for a gender less baby. the world is because so ridiculous you just have to laugh at it. actual craziness is becoming acceptable
yea the numbers totally back up your premise. how many studios would love to have ppl be fatigued by their work and make a half a bill in 2 weeks. youre one of those  huh
people saying they re suffering movie fatigue is nonsense. there are shows that people watch nightly. some they watch weekly and some they watch monthly. marvel  dc and star wars combined are probably releasing their awful shows at a rate of twice a week. this isn t too much. what s too much is the terrible  woke writing.
yes  I know. I heard about it. you dont need to remind me
dc is as bad on series as marvel is on movies  for me its the constant release of super hero genre on both sides  not to mention how many times dc re booted batman  than they brought in all the reboots using one multiverse. what s even worse is they compete with one another so one wants to outshine the other.
people act like they have to see there selves in comic books  they need to get over them selves and just watch a damn movie and have fun
Imean orphans probably feel related to him lets be fair.I am both kind of joking and not joking.
how is the later seasons cringe
Im not sure where the fascination of a cartoon or comic book character s views on politics or sexuality comes from. I dont need to know if sonic the hedgehog is gay or whatever. thats not important. its like society. we ve come so far as a society  that at some point over the last decade  we ve been consumed with going back to square one  and questioning and challenging our own biology  rather than keeping on with the issues that really matter and overcome challenges that will actually benefit the human race moving forward.
one famous moment in marketing history was when coke replaced the familiar taste with new coke. new coke sucked. how do I know  because they brought out coke classic which was the old coke  and the coke we know today. nobody was racist  phobic  blah blah blah. people still wanted coke  but they rejected the new flavor. marvel should learn a lesson from that.
gotta swap em all!
I dislike a great deal of whats going one.but honestly the hate on dr strange 2 seems really misplaced.  it felt a lot more like the comics than the first one and was generally well done. raimI is more suited to strange than spider-man and while chavez  also movie version of her was leagues better than comic  ersio.  was a important part of the plot it never felt like she was overshadowing him.similarly I the hawkeye disney plus series was the only time I cared about hawkeye.  some people really hate it because of keate bishop  again better in live action than the comics  but the actress playing her was really good and they didn t make her magically component.again most of what s going on sucks but some people have done a good stuff during it.also moon knight was mostly good as was werewolf by night.
amen sister!
Im personally not interested as much as I used to with superhero movies. feels like they re milking the franchises as much as they can and the cow has been dead for years so the milk is sour.
superman   let s fight together to deal with climate change! me is sense   cant you  I dunno  do a yearly refreeze on the ice caps  lot of water around them. I ll pick up some trash if you promise that...yay  together!
never forget that ironheart was ripped off from a japanese prawn. also  steelers fan  I root for the chiefs myself.
12 45 the more I watched dr strange 2 the more I liked it because the scarlet witch was a prime example of modern females today s selfish self-centered monsters they are while trying to portray themselves as better than what they are... this is what narcissistic females with power look like... no accountability till it is too late... the man was the hero
I got no problem with all the changes just dont put down your most frequent customers
Im gonna say it. captain america  the winter soldier was the height of marvel. cap 2 was the best marvel movie to date. it all just went downhill after that. and then it officially died after endgame.
the problem with these weirdos is that they are not listening to what we are complaining about. its not the fact they are trying to push certain characters  its that the stories are fucking horrible and the execution has been fumbled each time. if the stories were good people would have no problems. did people complain when they made jean grey the dark phoenix and made her the focus of the storyline  no  because the story was executed beautifully.  was dc editorial called sexist when they killed supergirl in coie  no. because her sacrifice was heroic and noble and in character and we were all gutted when we read it.heck let s go to house of m  2005  this is when marvel were making the move to push  ms marvel carol danvers as a bigger deal in the marvel universe and fans were all for it because the character had the potential to be one of the major stars but was never given a fair shot. it hasnt been a sexist or discriminatory issue  it all comes down to this  just tell good stories.
justice bump
if your getting fatigued  maybe your a normie and need to wait for the next trendy thing to fallow!comic fans will still watch the movies  even if they suck!
I am fatigued by poor scripts and management s disrespect of the mcu audience.
I dont exactly believe the bibel  but I believe in something  higher . a bit complicated and not really important. but if its about values  I share them. and  I believe in some kind of fate or destiny  something real  pure and beautiful in being human. having and following this values. and I believe in getting tested.  and its strange  because  woke culture  claims to represent this values. not just a few  all of them. and if you follow their logic  its  true . like racism and sexism. they try to get rid of statistic differences. but if you look at  how they want to achive that  they do it with racist and sexist quota or privileges. like on university. so its totally the opposite to what they claim to fight for. and its forced on people. and to come to my point here  to what it has to do with the bibel  for example its the perfect perversion. its 100  untrue while not really a lie. and here in germany some people say something like  the devil never lies  but fools. and corrupts.and its strange  because  woke culture  is 100  what you would expect from the devil to make out of Christian values.and for most of us  all of that is some kind of test  for sure. regardless of being religious or not. if we really understand our values  and are able to see  or if we get fooled. and its sad  how many fail  especially in positions of power. but  you have to see  too  if its about regular people  a lot pass the test and are successful. yes  they try to force it on the people  always and everywhere. but the majority disagrees with  woke culture . I am glad to see that  and I just hope  that wont change.
to be honest I see marvel movie I go  no thanks.   like if robert downey jr. signed on for another iron man I would not care.  I am not interested in seeing another iron man movie  and I dont really care what the plot is or whether or not the political nonsense is included.  these movies were never as good as people acted like they were with a very small number of exceptions that were great.  the good stories have already been told  their efforts political or otherwise are pretty much creatively bankrupt.  this isn t just a super hero movies either  it is hollywood in general.
the mcu  I think you mean em-she-you!
I noticed this trend some years ago when I attempted to watch star wars rebels on dizny hd on cable. the toy merch being pedaled seemed exclusively aimed at brainless 12 yr old girls. aren t you going to lose half your market that way  I couldn t keep up with the series  even though I liked it better than most sw. granted  Im no kid  but I couldn t imagine boys being able to tolerate much of the tooth rotting girly commercials either.
I was so disappointed with love and thunder  the trailer made itseem like the guardians of the galaxy and thor were going to share a whole movie together. then they dip out about 10 minutes in... way to bait and switch.
thor ragnarok was worse.
@chandler burse  raganrok was painful. it had a few bits I liked but it was like 85 horrid.I couldn t bring my self to see love and thunder
@leon evelake  actually Imeant love and thunder. I actually like ragnarok my bad.
@chandler burse  ah gotcha
I dont think its just the ice caps that are at risk though  its like the entire climate and he cant just change that especially without risking major consequences if he does something wrong I would say.
not to mention as much as it kind of hurts the point of superman sometimes. some versions make the point thatsuperman cannot nor should intervene in a way that changes humanity s fate without its own ability to do so. its kind of like how he needs to accept that krypton couldn t be saved unless they did something and he cannot always solve our problems for us even if he could this also is a point that undermines lex luthor s most  logical  reason for hating superman which is that with a man in the sky they all look up to. humanity will never strive to be greater and instead go back to worshipping powerful deities in the skies.
superman red son sort of gives an answer to what would happen if superman just fixed all of humanity s issues.
I didn t know this. what s the background
for me endgame was the end for me. all the storylines I cared about had concluded. I would ve stuck with it  but I knew where the mcu was headed when steve gave the shield to sam over bucky  and when thor inexplicably handed the throne of asgard to valkyrie. spider-man was the exception  but the credit for that film goes to sony.
superman protesting on anything is likeelon musk voluntering for a bake sale.in both cases it is a waste of their time and effort.
phase 4 and 5  failed comics from 2015-2016
I dont feel like its marvel fatigue  but really just shitty marvel fatigue. if the quality was still good people would be fine with it.
m-she-u
bad writing   weird political injectsions indeed.  Imean look at star wars  clone wars going for 7 series   then rebel for another 4. and it isnt even the best writing either  but at least they dont directly offend their audience   inject kindergarden logic   politics into everything. not saying that you cant get bored by being flooded by quantity. Imean ironman 1 movie really sucked me in but when we reached ironman 3 I was a lot more  meh  to the whole thing. however the he weird activist injections completely makes it unwatchable  espcially as its very malicios   one sided.
here s a hot take for ya.yout religion teaches humility in a drastically different context to most anime. your Bible teaches that we are all humble before jehova... most anime says the community  in some way  is the greater commitment. friends  family... or honor  which ties into the previous concepts. tangible.if your God asked you to sacrifice your firstborn child to him  your humility before your God prevents you from even questioning it. any resistance or questioning is  by your teachings  prideful and sinful.I am glad that you can enjoy the morality displayed in most anime... but be real  dude  it d a bunch of atheists and shinto followers writing this stuff. buddhists probably make a large share of mangaka. Im speculating  but based on actual regional demographics. -  your God is actually featured  directly or metaphorically  as the villain of several anime that fall into this very category.
good comic book writers are the verge of extinction.
I dunno. you had me understanding you until you started talking about the Bible. people love to quote the parts of the Bible that they think are positive while ignoring the parts that are harmful. you know...the ones that glorify mass murder  slavery  rape  blind faith  mindless co0nformity  and even one or two that justify cannibalism as a punishment from God. yeah  there s moral reciprocity in the new testament but there are also messages there that run counter to itsuch as Jesus saying   slaves obey your masters.  also  be aware that politics and identity issues aren t something new in comics  melonie. the x-men comes to mind. its been grappling with things like racism and antisemitism since the 1950s. just be aware of thatso youre able to pint a full picture of things.
I think its pronounced the m-she-u.
amen!
correction  dcu is not a problem  its the mcu  period .
I would say this is the quality and narrative of woke fatigue. they should cut down on quantity for sake of quality. not every z list character needs their own stand alone movie or show.they also do not need to replace so many male characters with female characters. they also do not need to disrespect the legacy characters.you have something about the romances used to be side stories. now they want the romance to be the story specifically the sexuality. the characters must be gay or trans like they are. I think that is because they are not confident in their sexuality. that means they are over compensating. instead of creating a new character and just letting the sexuality be a side story they must turn so many legacy characters gay  lesbian or trans.activists are a-holes. if there is nothing to complain about because the world is good  then they make up something to be enraged by. that way they can carry out their activism and then cry that they are victims.I really have no problem with people who are different. you are gay  lesbian or trans  just keep that lifestyle away from kids and dont try and push it on the rest of us. thats your thing. heck. I dont talk about all the women I boink. dont think anyone would want to hear about that. well  whether it happens or not isn t the point. no one wants to hear the details  do they  they dont want that flaunted in their face. no one wants to see me and some beautiful women have sex in the public sphere. same rule applies to the lgbtq  community. from those in the community I know  they are discrete  too. its the lgbtq pcacm activists that cause a lot of the issues and I think most people are tired of what they push on us. that includes in entertainment.I have no problem with movies like brokeback mountain or bros. I have no interest in them  but its okay if people want to see them. big tent pole movies are not the place for this content.
Im looking forward to see the financial downfall of marvel
she looks so cute
story first everything else after.
be humble or be humbled.
I walked out of thor love and thunder
16 50 welcome to vrchat!
I dont understand why this is still going on  you would think after a year of experimenting  or after the first few things came out that failed  they would stop. I wish they could have more creativity and create new characters to fail instead of making established characters fail. batman and superman is over 80 years old.. you cant tell me after 80 years no one can come up with somthing new
thats a bad way to view superman. one of the reasons he s so likable and praised as a superhero in both irl and in the universe is that nothing is below him. he is a super fast human being who does more than just punch lex luthor. he has many times helped people with issues in their business  there is a comic called superman grounded where he was walking the country  helping a woman not commitsuicide while at the same time showing a man what was wrong with his truck. revealed one man had a heart condition that needed to be checked. saved a boy from an abusive father. burned some drug dealers  stashes. superman is above and beyond. he cares for everyone and everything and thats what makes his character great. he does big things and little things. he does not see himself above doing street stuff like batman or spider-man as much as he would see himself above fighting darkseid. I could honestly believe he would be at a bake sale if it was for a good cause. and I am pretty sure superman did advocate for civil rights in the comics. like many writers did with characters back in the day.
more of a weird take thats kind of interesting but hard to fully grasped for some people rather than a hot one I say.
@chandler burse  youre probably right  but maybe you d be surprised. many Christians take grave exception to the idea that modern morality is often in direct conflict with biblical morality. it comes up in this video  and a lot of others from anti-woke creators  that they conflate anti-woke positions with pro-abrahamic positions... but thats just my pet peeve.
the Bible does not glorify either of those things  but condems them. itshares historical information  but much of it is to show us the error of said people s ways. people who have not actually taken the time to read the Bible so easily fall for fragmented  out of context conclusions made out of ignorance or hate.
@melonie mac go boom  the Bible even as a Christian myself still has passages that many people interpret differently and it does sometimes have rough areas where you can see where the other side comes from. even though it was meant as a condemnation of the criminal the Bible does say at some point in the old test that a woman should marry her rapist in order for him to raise any children sired and for him to pay the family back over time. but that could easily been seen as a very horrible idea in this day and age.
I am not sure if Jesus was the actual speaker. the only quote I can remember where your saying this is peter s own writings and yes indeed it does say for servants to obey the master but it also says for masters to respect their slaves and not punish them harshly or brutally especially for no good reason. I kind of always felt the Bible there was speaking more on terms of a worker and boss rather than what we know as immoral and abusive slavery and a tormenting master. and if I am not wrong many of the slaves then were volunteers as they often did it for work and the ability to have a place to sleep and eat. it wasn t exactly forced slavery but then again it was the roman empire  which their slavery was still different and people do not speak of it the same way we speak of american slavery for whatever reason  but I am not sure enough really.
@melonie mac go boom  I really dont think the passage he mentioned is ever directly condemning the action of slavery either. Imean one can interpret it as  that was the time and this is what peter saw fit to say about it. but things are different now  I dont really know how you could see it as its condemning it there maybe it did elsewhere but I honestly cant remember where if it does.of course its still a far cry from Jesus or God straight up saying  yeah dark skinned people bad  enslave them and beat them  which wouldn t even make sense since Jesus and most of the Bible characters are probably not white anyways.
@melonie mac go boom   slaves  obey your earthly masters in everything  and do it  not only when their eye is on you and to curry their favor  but with sincerity of heart and reverence for the Lord.  -colossians 3 22I d say thats glorifying slavery  mel. not thatsurprising though because the Bible was written by slave owners  especially in the ot. the only times the scriptures went against slavery was when it was the jews were being enslaved by foreigners. as for mass murder  sorry but God supposedly commanded the israelites to kill the amalekites and  spare none . this literally means to kill babies and pregnant mothers along with the amalekite soldiers. and thats not the only incidence of mass murder being glorified in the Bible. and Ive barely scratched the surface of atrocities glorified by the Bible. but its to be expected that writings from that time and place would glorify such things. after all  there were none of what we modern folk would consider  good guys  in the bronze and iron ages.
@chandler burse    yeah dark skinned people bad  enslave them and beat them  biblical slavery wasn t as much based on skin color  though. if Im not mistaken  the ancient jews were as fond of enslaving each other as they were of enslaving foreigners. and you were allowed to beat your slaves as hard as you wanted just so long as they didn t die within 3 days. in any case  its wrong to own other humans and if God can command the israelites not to eat shellfish or wear two different fabrics at the same time  then he can just as easily command them to not practice slavery and punish them for owning slaves. a supposedly omnipotent God doesnt need to conform to the sensibilities of his worshippers. rather  such a God would make them conform to his if he actually existed and was moral.
@the paul walker experience  I never said biblical slavery was based on skin. I was actually saying that as an example to show the Bible isn t downright condoning the evil of slavery we know and recognize today from the 1800s america period.
@the paul walker experience  God cannot make humans do everything. they did not always listen to the food routines or be against every minor sin thats why they did sacrifices. he could not make them follow everything because at the end of the day he allowed them to have free will.
@the paul walker experience  a God who makes people conform to him would be seen as a tyrant though which he already is seen as by many.
@chandler burse    a God who makes people conform to him would be seen as a tyrant though which he already is seen as by many. that may be true. but he can be a tyrant when it comes to shellfish but not when it comes to ending slavery  or how about not commanding mass murder  e.g. the amalekites
@chandler burse   I never said biblical slavery was based on skin. I was actually saying that as an example to show the Bible isn t downright condoning the evil of slavery we know and recognize today from the 1800s america period.  okay  but in that case  what about ot statutes that a slave owner can beat his slaves as much as he wants so long as the said slave doesnt die within 3 days  or that female slaves have to submitsexually to their male masters  because...yikes! thats way worse than a mere  bad optic .
@the paul walker experience  he cannot actually stop people from eating shellfish entirely Imean. and slavery is a common thing a method that made nations great and build up. egypt wouldn t have been so progressed if it didn t have the israelite slaves unless I am wrong. even if its awful it was something nations wanted and needed. rome had slaves that they utilized efficiently to make most of their industry work perfectly and why their roads were often layered upon layered over each other and well built.
@the paul walker experience  I also could ve remembered the Bible saying beating or treating a slave harshly without any proper justification wasn t allowed something that most slave owners in the 1800s didn t give a crap about as slaves were basically your property and had no rights to be treated any better than a simple tool.
@the paul walker experience  Ive never read anywhere where slaves were to submitsexually to masters can you cite these verses
@the paul walker experience  if I am not also wrong the Bible also stated that if a master treated their slave badly for no real reason or even killed them under circumstances they should be punished harshly or even killed themselves which is again something I dont think our modern view of slavery and those masters of slaves in the 1800s really cared for. now whether slaves lived good lives back then its whatever but I would say God s views of it in the old test are at least slightly better if not more better than how people viewed slaves in a more recent decade.
@the paul walker experience  to be fair no matter what we view ourselves your point still has relevance and importance and is something to consider when one forms their own beliefs.
@chandler burse    Ive never read anywhere where slaves were to submitsexually to masters can you cite these verses   teach slaves to be subject to their masters in everything  to try to please them  not to talk back to them -titus 2 9notice it doesnt say some things. itsays all things. this includes sexually  forced marriage  etc.
@chandler burse    God cannot make humans do everything. they did not always listen to the food routines or be against every minor sin thats why they did sacrifices. he could not make them follow everything because at the end of the day he allowed them to have free will. but he can still issue commandments. and the Bible is clear that the jews were punished as a whole by God on more than one occasion. the fact that God has strong opinions about shellfish and fabrics but not about abolishing slavery is quite telling.
@chandler burse    he cannot actually stop people from eating shellfish entirely Imean.  yet a lot of jews obeyed this. once again  God has strong opinions about shellfish and fabric and ordering the mass murder of the amalekites but cant be bothered to condemn slavery  its been said that civilizations invent Gods who are just like the people within those civilizations. I submit that a society of slaveowners would invent a God that refused to abolish slavery.   and slavery is a common thing a method that made nations great and build up. this doesnt make it moral or necessary. it just makes profits for the ruling class.   egypt wouldn t have been so progressed if it didn t have the israelite slaves unless I am wrong. actually  history shows that the hebrew captivity is a historically suspect thing  at least as the ot presents it. biblical apologists claim that 3-4.5 million jews fled egypt from bondage. this was demographically impossible in the ancient world. no country at the time has the resources to control such a large slave population.  even if its awful it was something nations wanted and needed. wanted  sure. needed  I doubt that. and once again  God needn t conform to the sensibilities of his flock. God doesnt ask permission or tiptoe around them. God issues orders and expects them to be carried out in the Bible. God also punishes kings and israel as a whole for disobedience at times. nowhere does the Bible condemn slavery. we modern folk have had to do that.
@the paul walker experience  all does not mean that. let s not get technical here this does not literally mean God is saying  yes you can force them to have sex with you
@the paul walker experience  how can you prove nations then didn t need it  maybe there was a better way a more voluntary way but my Lord good luck getting any nation to forgo its selfishness. I dont think things are thatsimple and the economy of civilizations then relied on slave labor very heavily.
@the paul walker experience  God does not conform he commands but he does not force your both asking for God to be tyrant and just make us do everything perfectly  but also disapproving of his commands.
@the paul walker experience  to be fair the Bible has stuff that actually would piss off some slave owners itself.
@the paul walker experience  I dont know what you want I cant make anyone believe anything nor do I want to not in this sense. I doubt my own beliefs  but in the end everyone believes their own way. people who at least produce a kinder ideal of Christianity and the Bible are less likely to repeat the mistakes of more bigotted Christians anyways.
@the paul walker experience  to be also fair Jesus was in fact often a showmanship against the believers of his time. people did not approve of the teachings in the new test and it often condemned the believers then. so I dont think its necessarily that Jesus was close to what believers then were like.
@chandler burse    how can you prove nations then didn t need it   because its never needed. and if it were  does that make it right  I dont think it does. it certainly violates the golden rule  as nobody wants to be a slave.   maybe there was a better way a more voluntary way but my Lord good luck getting any nation to forgo its selfishness. um...we did do exactly that here in america. we fought a war over it  in fact.   I dont think things are thatsimple and the economy of civilizations then relied on slave labor very heavily.  it doesnt matter and this isn t hard  do you want to be a slave  Im guessing you dont. but if you support any form of slavery at any time for any reason  this means you dont care about moral reciprocity. you ve essentially taken it out back behind the woodshed and shot it in the back of the head.
@chandler burse   but I would say God s views of it in the old test are at least slightly better if not more better than how people viewed slaves in a more recent decade. sorry but Im not impressed by this. Christians always tell me that God isn t just the author of objective morality. they tell me God is objective morality itself in a neo-platonic sense. if thats true  then I expect such a God to declare slavery anathema. its telling that we mere mortals could eventually figure out that humans aren t property but the supposed source of all that is moral couldn t say   nope  right from the get-go.
@the paul walker experience  need is not always the same as whats moral to be fair.humans have always done bad things for necessity.
@the paul walker experience  yes we fought a war over it. its not something easy to deal with. and imagine a newly formed nation.
@the paul walker experience  I suppose so. but I dont know anymore. life is so depressing and feels meaningless and the meaning we try to give it isn t a enough for me or some others. having kids isn t anything special to me. I dont even want them. love feels like an addiction and one I am seeking too much of and I despise my own sexual desires at this point. it just feels like there has to be more and if there isn t. then I dont know what I am doing. and I fear that maybe everyone should fear death then.
@chandler burse    life is so depressing and feels meaningless and the meaning we try to give it isn t a enough for me or some others. maybe you need some help. seriously  talk to a therapist.    having kids isn t anything special to me. I dont even want them. you aren t required to have children. at least not by me or any other atheist Im acquainted with.  love feels like an addiction and one I am seeking too much of and I despise my own sexual desires at this point ah  Im not going to pry into that as Im not a trained therapist. Im afraid that I would do you more harm than good. I d talk to such a therapist  though.    it just feels like there has to be more and if there isn t. then I dont know what I am doing. Imay be wrong but itsounds like youre looking for a sense of purpose. I cant tell you what to do but Im an optimistic nihilist. in the absence of a divinely mandated purpose  I decide my own purpose. it required some inner work on my part but I know who I am and what I want to do with my life. just a thought and Im honestly not sure if you can benefit from it. just my two cents.   it just feels like there has to be more and if there isn t. then I dont know what I am doing. well  I fear death. I dont think fearing death is a bad thing. fearing death has actually led to a lot of human progress. I love things like medicine  air conditioning  weather forecasts  safety tips  etc.
@the paul walker experience  no not that I am required for kids but the idea of it being the meaning we have is just kind of pathetic sometimes to me. not good enough.
@the paul walker experience  human progress shouldn t be done out a of fear of death we cant ever escape anyways.
@the paul walker experience  deciding my own purpose is the problem I am saying and no why does everyone want me to talk to some damn doctor for a bunch of money that they probably cant help me anyways  it just feels like everyone knows life is dumb and stupid and no one wants to admit it they are too proud and dumb.deep down I guess no one actually cares for anyone and I guess I wished people would. but even I dont all the time.
@chandler burse    human progress shouldn t be done out a of fear of death we cant ever escape anyways. why not  why should we not try to extend the human lifespan to 250  or 500  yeah  we cant live forever. but every year of life is still better than one less year of it. fear of death is ironically proof that one is still alive. fear of death means embracing life itself.
@the paul walker experience  I dont think humans can or would live well that long our bodies always break down a lot around 80 or 90 we live to 200 its gonna be as bad as just being on life support probably.
@the paul walker experience  fear of death to the point of obsession is not really living at all. life and death are natural and work together thats the only truth I seem to think is 100  true. humans should focus on living not to escape death itself. everyone should progress for mankind not to live longer selfishly.
@chandler burse  Im not talking about fearing it to the point of obsession though. Im talking about the normal and natural fear of death all animal species have  including humans. I often hear theists telling me that they have  no fear of death  and think they re either shitting me or that they have nothing actually in their lives  much like a suicide bomber.
@the paul walker experience  if the biggest reason to live is because we fear not living then life is really pointless itsounds like. and believe it or not there are people who really dont fear death.
@chandler burse  fearing death isn t the only reason to live but its a damn good start. it means you have a strong life force. if one fears death  its because they have something to live for. and thatsomething need not be God. if God is the only thing I have to look forward to  then Im glad there s no evidence of an afterlife. and yeah there are people who dont fear death. but I d say those people fear being alive  as well.
@the paul walker experience  well I dont really have anything going on so....I dont really like living and I dont really like dying.
sadly the machine is already in place and they are still making billions  so not likely they will crash so fast
statically there is less women watching superhero movies then men and after all the main characters are converted to mary sues  there will be less men and lesser women watching them but they will blame the toxic fandom for their movie sucking.
the marvel side kick universe of sidekicks dressed as the heros you love..dc batman and superman will be fighting there rogues.. where hulk villians I guess are fighting cap side kicks even tho he is a hero not dead on the mcu.. guess she hulk and giving him a kid was that bad
happy birthday!
@melonie mac go boom
I dont think there is super hero fatigue.I think there is stupid movie fatigue.
if you take your earphones turn them upside down   wrap the core behind your ears they will stay in better.

representation narcissism
im in lov
dont worry silk is coming to replace spiderman
lol marvel has always inserted in different races and so forth.
here s the kicker. female fans of marvel were fans of marvel because of what it was  not in spite of it.
its too many shows and movies that are mediocre  so-so or just bad  some unnecessary  ms. marvel  what if  and all hijacked by sociopolitical messaging.
I hate to be  that guy  because I think all the things you said are right on the money 100 . however all things current year have a level of narcissistic tendency. including Christianity  depending on the flavor of religion one happens to be. to look at the vastness of everything and to proclaim that it was made  for me  has its own baggage. I also was a believer 23-25ish years wanted to be a preacher. then I started studying when youread more than just the good stuff in the Bible  then read other holy books then think of scope and scale of religion in general. 3000 unused goods 300 000  subsets  splinter groups  sects of just Christianity alone plus the geography of belief systems. I cant throw that dart and say yes 99  most correct answer.
a key tenant of satanism is self worship. coincidence
Im gonna stick with classic marvel
lets just say goobye to marvel  bye!
go steelers!!
noooooooo!
I walked away from my faith for a time  learned a big lesson the hard way. if you were a believer before then God will bring you back in if you listen. Im sure one day you will  just as I did. when I returned to my faith I had lots of things I was still unsure about  but I chose to surrender and have faith. God has revealed a lot to me and answered many of those questions  and I know I will get answers to more as I continue my journey. some questions Imay never know until I see heaven  but thats ok. faith is a fundamental part of Christianity. Im so beyond grateful to be back in my faith  and one day if you find God again you will be too.
@melonie mac go boom  and thats quite possible  albeit unlikely. the only thing I felt when I left was relief. I was glad I didn t have an always disapointed father watching my every move knowingn he will never be pleased. like when  I put on a polyblend or ate shell fish  checked that girl I liked in high-school  saw someone driving a sick automobile and genuinely wished I had one  having thoughts every day of killing my abusive father  then spendding my young life being shrouded in guilt for every single one of those as a hell worthy trespass. and no its not because I wanted to sin  I hate this thought process oh   athiest huh so what stops you from raping and killing . my thought turns to the religious saying is it only God that prevents you from doing the same.the worst part is that the indoctrination was done the guilt plagues me to this day consumed by apathy and nihilism. because to me its easier to say that my life s  meaning  is not one sewn into the fabric of the cosmos by a divine agent of all good. its more comforting to say my life has no  meaning . I cant have faith because I can reach any point  or answer so long as that I have faith that its true. over simplistic example 1 1 2 but if you have faith it can equal 3. so now I am just a retired veteran who apparently is mentally ill because of this line of thinking. by withholding stock in the term belief your not quite right.
its really hard as a Christian to 100  fully accept that we know for an honest fact this world was created the way the Bible says  that everything is true. that all other beliefs are false and we have hope there is something after death. I have and still struggle with that idea. at the end of the day maybe it is worth to take note that  dying with hope and belief in something is better than dying with a belief in nothing  is true.
@let s talk horror  genuinely a Christian who is under the constant worry of sinning and being judged is sometimes said to not be properly following how Christianity should be. it does not want you to excuse sin sure. but it does not want you to be defined by your guilt and failures as far I ever understood something I struggle with but not always due to fearing judgment of a God but rather how society views things and how I fear my sins say I am a terrible person who does not deserve redemption at least in the eyes of others. some people say Christianity should be like being broken free of chains rather than being chained down. some people have a hard time accepting that  others do not  and some may need to learn. but it really is what it is. and I honestly I am kind of polarized by the statement of  if you were a real believer you wouldn t have lost your faith  I get where it comes from. but it only serves to either stroke fear or a furthering of lack of belief in someone I feel.its also the same argument every religion uses  islam has their own versions of course.
let s just take over successful male stuff and make itshit  - feminist writers everywhere.
hello marvel now my old friend
Im just giving the mcu a fu and I hope ironheart rusts until sleep. this name sounds like something from care bears...
love you
they keep talking about fatigue  but the fact is that people stopped watching marvel movies cause they are not good anymore. if they released good movies instead of woke fests  people would still be interested  but lately we just get mediocre movies full of agenda.
man I wrote an amazing scI fI novel you should check out!  there s none of this wokeness and agenda and it has focus only on story.
I love that her standard for mcu quality is trash.
disney marvel is massproduction  its all about quanity with a specific label m-she-u  and no quality control   its watch product  dont ask question  watch next product.
I dont know if its me or what  but these last marvel movies feel like a bunch of clips and scenes put together  it doesnt feel like a movie.and its really sad that me being from spain  I can see lot of people buying this stupid american ideology of being represented  races  etc. our society is completely different  and they want to copy the shitty stuff.
so hollywoke thinks that we want  badly written hand me outs from male superheroes  so  I think I will stick with manga manhwa manhua   anime.
marvel was doomed when disney bought it. disney has and will continue to milk marvel for all its worth  then when the superhero movie fad is over  they will drop it like a bad habit.
I see a pupper on the floor!
all the men agree with you sweetie okay but its going to keep happening until the men we need to be encouraged to go after disney we also think the financing to get a lawyer and get and get an import fees to do a lawsuit against disney for slander sex is towards men and assassination character until this lawsuit happens this s    is going to keep happening
people are tired of garbage stories and everyday politics and ideals interjected into something they want to have take them out of everyday life.
I saw love and thunder and honestly Im glad she thor jane foster died at the end
I disagree on youre opinion. phase 4 has shown us so many styles   genres to expand the mcu in greater ways. I did not mine she-hulk  ms marvel and rirI williams.
Im sick of woke everywhere and fff inge dogma
who is he protesting
you sound either nervous  going from the hip or drunk  seriously doubt  . you ok
gay superman   wtfff
not nervous or drunk  shooting from the hip yes. I dont script the high majority of my videos and speak my organic opinions on the spot
@melonie mac go boom   understood keep up with the good work
thought you have constructive feedback
what the dog doing
representation matters  where it truly matters  like in the legislature. not in films. if people want to represent  then great  get a soapbox  a platform  a party  some support and run for freakin office. if you get in  represent  and be accountable for your performance. until then  leave the films and screen sector alone. get your manifesto off my tv show. because I have plenty of other things to do with my time and money. I do not need to see failed politicians pushing marginal agendas on the screen as a soft option instead of running for office. as a consumer  I am axiomatically ... right. great work mel. boom!
0 25 all the above especially for normies  they can put up with a lot of crap woke stuff if its spread out  but stacking that crap on top of wome crap  even normies can see that
superman protesting  climate change ... and yet he spun the planet backwards !
I thought Jesus Christ settled the narcissism issue 2023 years ago
100  the quality has crashed into the shitter!
I dont watch disney anymore. their ideology nonsense is no longer tolerable.
your dog. lol
representation like what youngrippa59 said is the stupidest thing to ever exist.
I cantell you this with the utmost certainty  no kid  absolutely zero child born pre-2015  is or was thinking deeply about representation. when I was a kid  I didn t give seven shades of shit whether or not a programme or movie was diverse or not  if it was  awesome  if it wasn t  cool  no skin off my back  time to finish my juice box and go back to playing with my barbies. its a damn lie that these activists complain that as a kid  they didn t have any characters that  looked like them   which is the most self-centered view you could ever have on something  btw   when they most certainly didn t dwell on it when they were actually kids. they re just looking over their childhood unfavourably like that because they ve been brainwashed by race hustlers to believe that thats actually an issue worth caring about.Im a massive weeb and I couldn t care less that 90-95  of the characters in the shows I watch dont look like me - I care about them as people  the struggles they go through  their passions  hopes  dreams and goals  etc.  because that is far more meaningful than if a character and I were to share the same appearance.we ve been saying this for well over 5 years now  but if you keep reducing characters down to their immutable characteristics  then the problem is y o u  and it will always be y o u.
rirI williams didn t come off as a smart character at all. very arrogant and dumb
did you stop reading verses at the end of videos
go steelers!
look a recon looks to get away from the real world and real world problems stop it
we dont need iron heart at the moment  if we need women empowerment and diversity we already got pepper pots and war machine
this not only mcu its all bad stories and bad acting.
not superhero fatigue. ive got disney fatigue. the only disney thing im on now is kingdom hearts 3
yo never been this early
made me mad how disappointing dr strange 2 was.
yes  I feel like it was turning my channel into a channel for just Christians and my intent is to reach everyone  so instead of rushing in a verse into daily video uploads I just talk about my faith when led to in my videos  but I share Bible verses and my opinions on faith based topics near daily on my instagram stories  my discord community also created a weekly Bible study on my server as well!
@melonie mac go boom  Im not a Christian  but I respected your readings and was interested in your opinions of it  I didn t notice when you stopped  just realized today. I understand why you stopped though     you could always do it like smarter everyday. his videos end on a title card with a verse reference have a nice week end!
even kindgom hearts 3 disappointed me

@melonie mac go boom  and I dont expect kingdom hearts 4 to be better  now thatsqueenix has also started making dumb decisions. the dismantling of everything I know and love is almost complete
we are not tired of superhero movies  but tired of the wokeness  gender swaping and the man hating in the m she u all together!! they just have to go back and tell the comic book stories of the 80 s 90 s and 2000 s ...stick to the source material and stop the pushing agenda s!!! people will return if they realize this!!
I dont watch tv and movies anymore. all the hot woke garbage is not for me.
I love how they re trying to spin these crap showrunners and writers  ruining franchises  to  people are just getting tired of  insert ruined franchise here    star wars ruined  guess peeps are tired of star wars.  star trek ruined  guess peeps just got tired of star trek.  marvel dc ruined guess peeps are tired of superhero.  lmao
well yeah pretty much there us a marvel show and or movie on every month of the year and it amgetting old because they are just bashing white people men and stereotyping black and brown people and people are getting sick of it.
the mcu went downhill.
again I ask  youre one of those types huh kiddo
I didn t watch ms marvel she hulk enternals.  not interested and wont watch. matthew last disney plus thing I saw is moon knight ans will see werewolf at night.
you know that I agree with you right you know that I dont like this whole you know man bashing stuff this company is just like you dont like it thats because disney has become not just a woke up and become a famous company and its going to keep happening until a lot of men get together and start suing disney for being sexist towards men and slander and association of character then this crap will stop if another company did this and they were just completing those men like a men s company bashing women like this I ll trust that they wouldn t hear the end of it I dont think its really so-called companies are just bashing men ridiculous
its the low quality that causes it. dc has a small amount of characters they use while marvel uses a bunch  mostly nobodies  and so normally if the quality was decent or high people who be ok with all the variety however the quality is so low that its all just garbage and a chore to watch.
this is why modern garbage entertainment will never make bank
they re not even superhero movies anymore.they re all propaganda films.
youre a Christian yet you blocked me on twitter for holding you accountable during the amoranth controversy!
anime manga lovers any care about the story and character development. anime manga is forever  sadly I feel like comic book movies are just getting woker and woker. if I wanna watch a dceu mcu movie that I really am interested in I ll pay for it  but most of them Im not interested and rather wait and watch it for free
first off imma big fan of yours.... since you are a  woke   Christian  have you thought of changing your banner pic from the one eye and mocking tongue
both actually it is just too much of the same old song and dance.  in the last decade only a few movies stand apart from the sludge.
last marvel film I saw was spider-man before that endgame  I dont watch their shows at all. as far as dc goes and ima bigger dc guy then marvel  last dc movie I saw was the suicide squad and thatsucked Im skeptical on black adam bcuz Im a huge black adam fan and dont like how they made him in the movie
my main issue is none of the movies shows are true to the source material. race swapping  gender swapping   sexual identity swapping ruins everything!
its is all about quality  we are sick of the woke garbage  it is not just being woke either  the writing stories are terrible.
good  let it all burn and maybe someone passionate can bring it up from the ashes.
Im playing my own superhero called white man. I dont need no wussy marvel stuff
no way home is great though if you like spider-man
over saturation is a problem with dc  marvel  and star wars. add in the excessive identity politics... lol.. people are just tuning it. I was a massive fan of all 3 for 22 years. now... no. they have not only out out to much  but 90 of it is... meant to be insulting and offensive  yeah naw. my time and dollars is better put elsewhere. enjoy diving towards failure dc  marvel  disney!disney!also. it takes 5 hours of watching to get 10 minutes of entertainment.  lol who had time for that
Jesus mention that a great tribulation is coming  what is that
disney marvel will never have a superman or batman! sony has spiderman. dc should be knocking it out of the park.
mcu needs to learn from netflix in relation to female leads in superhero shows.  jessica jones was a strong woman but not insufferable like the disney mcu female hero knockoffs.
you cant gender swap and race swap just one gender and one race  thats prejudice and people dont like that
superman fought nuclear weapons in the quest for peace.  being woke isn t new.
people just want to bitch to bitch. there s what  3 movies and maybe 3 shows a year  thats not much at all. if you dont like the concept of a particular movie or show  then dont watch it.
superman could solve the climate problem ten different ways before breakfast. so why protest
she-hulk first appeared in 1980captain marvel first appeared in 1967namor fought pollution in 1989. none of this is new or woke  nice anger-tainment tho. box office proves you wrong time after time.
cw shows are terrible except superman and lois
honestly as a superhero fan boy I can comfortable say I fucking hate both the mcu and dceu with all my heart as of late dc because well its basically the edge Lord convention   and not the good mgr ones   and marvel for well just look at phase 4 like I have friends who only watched the movies asking me questions that the movies should be giving them the answers too but nope let s go do something else like replace a beloved character with a cheap woke knock-off thank God the dceu us at least going in a different direction now if only marvel could anyway great vid as always
based
I ll never understand why they keep buying up all of these ips  only to piss away their potential. the witcher series  lotr  halo  everything marvel. Im just not interested in spending my money to watch a golden goose get slowly tortured to death.
trump should just take over the mcu.
completely apathetic to the mcu. phase 4 has been horrendously bad. Im out.
no  Im not tired of superheroes. yes Im tired of the bad story and the woke bs shoehorned in. stop screwing up our favorite characters -.-
just to let yall know black panther  was a great movie and is an exceptipn do not throw your racist ideals on the movie because it is mostly black its legit a movie based on a fictional african country thatss all
Jesus fkn Christ  isn t real . didn t tony self love more than anyone   thor   people are so quick to hate  this shit is all amazing.  we need different stuff.  you want it all the same   no.  thats been the biggest complaint for years.  now we get variety and hate hate hate.  so dumb.  be happy we re getting anything is my motto
this video was boring  nothing you haven t talked about before
western media is so low standard its an embarrassment.
the events after the rapture as far I know  where the people who are not saved are left behind to struggle through disasters and issues of the world under the antI Christ if I am not wrong where they can still be saved but it will be far more difficult.
mcu should ve hired the showrunner of jj and pulled the lead writers from it as well. I imagine the dd and jj writers could ve written an actual legal super-hero show worth watching a whole season of.
@jon snowden  I totally agree.
people seem to act like supes is only good for punching invading aliens. its totally not like he hasn t done many  minor  things like advocate for racial equality and help people with depression and such before.
I dont think he would improve it. a politician businessman running a creative medium of which he s never handled before  its strange thatsome conservatives do believe he is the solution to all their problems.
be happy getting anything is a motto that is fine for you to believe in but its fine for others to not like what has been made and not to mention this motto is kind of saying all criticism is dumb and pointless and we should just consume whatever things come out even if its actually objectively bad  which things can be  like some gamers subscribe to this and I am fine if people like the newest cod but dont tell people to just love a game like ride to hell which is a buggy  poorly written and strangely made game.
oh look  more woke nonsense from the msheu. its a shame  the franchise started off so well...
I always have to crank the speed of youtube for you... why wont u improve and talk a bit faster than person who wants to hypnotize a person.. ur toooooooooo slowwwww to listen..
marvel is trash. stan lee is rolling in his grave. no respect for the original content
