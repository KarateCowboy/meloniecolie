y all believe the will smith slap was real. I believe in bigfoot. we re not the same.  - melonie mac. go boom right there.
its interesting that will smith actually laughed at the joke.
will smith single handedly saved and ruined the oscars at the same time. pun intended. xd
real. will smith s reaction afterwards says it all. it was  heart felt . keep up the good work mel.
it was very real. so  real that the board members of the academy are discussing right now about stripping will smith of his newly won oscar he just got last night. will smith even was issuing a public apology this morning for his actions and said what he did was uncalled and out of line. there is more to come from this event and so  far its not good for will smith.
your dad rocks. same kind of story. but some guy made fun of my sister playing softball  a year after she got hit by a truck. guy said something to the effect  she can hardly walk let alone bat  5 minutes later   he needed a straw to eat. my dad didn t slap.
all the hilarious memes that came out after the incident was the best part
agree or disagree  this video right here is why I follow mel  whether on yt or twitter!   insert anna kendrick boom gif as for the subject matter  Im 100  with her in the context that Im here for the meme rich content it presents!
the way chris was leaning before the slap made it look fake but wills attitude afterwards seemed genuine  but he s an actor after all so Im not sure
Im pretty sure its real.  if this was staged  Im not sure why will smith agreed to it.  he looks like a punk now and he s getting roasted on social media for it.  not sure why he d be on board with ruining his reputation.  unless he somehow thought this would make him look good
wow  slapsgiving came early this year  so merry slapsmas and a slappy new year.
first gut reaction was it had to be fake  but the after watching it a few times and seeing the commercial break footage  I think its most likely real. if it does end up being fake chris rock deserve will smiths award instead. his reaction was to good.
I just need an  everybody hates chris  edit with the jingle that ends each show and possible chris rock voice over.
the reach around these people are giving themselves is amazing! I wish I had that kind of flexibility!
to me itseemed fake  but who knows.  the way will was cursing at chris after it made itseemed real.  chris handled it like a pro though either way.  the wisest thing I ever heard from jada though was   the worst thing you can do is deny someone their faith.   let people believe what they want as long as they re decent people is all that matters.  I really respect the way you self censor when it comes to curse words in comments.  in boom we trust.
if it wasn t real  itsure sounded real to me. the facial reaction of chris rock and will smith angrily yelling at him afterward all point to real to me.
chris rock carried on like a pro
they both smiled right after the hit. on one camera angle you can see no contact was made
if it was fake then a lot of people were involved thats why I highly doubt the staged claim  .  though I felt both were in the wrong not to mention chris rock has been giving jada crap for years so I felt chris got off easy in my opinion.  thatstory of your dad showing righteous fury was cool
lara croft talk starts at 10 19also dont have a problem with the character wanting powers for selfish reasons since it gives the character a development journey to go on  learning uncle ben s lesson and all that.
my life has been a complete and total misery ever since bigfoot stole my precious girlfriend in the middle of the night. he even took all her clothes and the t.v.
we know bigfoot is real. he s been selling us beef jerky all these years.
@                         wait  bigfoot took your girl  her whole wardrobe  and the tv  thatsounds like an inside job  bro.
damn so edgy
he s my uncle!
and he smirked coming off the stage...suspicious
until he looked at his wife s face and noticed she was not. its all an infintile show of power.
he hadn t seen that his wife was angry at it yet
how these event work is that people dont actually laugh genuinely at jokes anyway  they fake smile and laugh so that they look good on camera. its a politeness thing. same thing if your photo is taken or when you attent a wedding or a birthday party  it doesnt matter if itsucks and s boring you smile and wave.
if he hadn t done something...his wife s boyfriend would have kicked his ass.
imagine ruining your own career crowning moment by taking a swing at the host.  are you such a loser that you dont know when you ve won   -- harvey kietel in dusk til dawn
the actor s reaction said it all.
@backup368  it was real lad. will smith has nothing to gain by doing that. chris rock too. why in God s name would he want to look like that in front of the world  he s 57 and rich what has he to gain
@mojo  because the oscars need ratings.
if it was real then why did will not get taken away  why did the rest of the show continue  why did chris s demeanour not change after the slap  why did will wait until he sat back down with a camera pointed at him before shouting angrily  this happened and the oscars got a rating boost. when every year it has lost viewers. because nobody cares about the oscars anymore. there are too many questions for this to be real. I ll ask you this  if you got slapped when giving a speech or presenting would you keep you cool and act like nothing happened personally I would drop the act and react to what happened and not continue like nothing did happen.
you guys do know these people are actors right
@gethin jones  if you think chris  demeanor didn t change youre either in serious denial or you just cant read basic body language very well. he was clearly surprised  shocked and embarrassed at what just happened. however  as a professional he handled it as best he could and tried to carry on with the show  despite stammering and even slipping his tongue  saying   we are here to give a documentary out  instead of  to give an oscar out for best documentary.  to say his demeanor didn t change is being disingenuous at best  look again.you can still say its all acting if it fits your narrative though  but if you believe that  then the oscar clearly should ve went to chris that night.
@gethin jones   if it was real then why did will not get taken away   well  he should have been. thats what we re saying  there should have been some consequences to him for what he did there. but yes it was real. no reason to think otherwise.
@backup368  cause the oscars needs ratings  lol. why would will smith and chris rock do it though  they dont need ratings they dont care. both in their 50 s and rich. that argument makes no sense.
@gethin jones  his demeanor clearly changed he was shocked. again why would will smith and chris rock do this for the oscars  they re rich and dont give a toss about ratings lol.
@mojo  will is still active in the industry  under many contracts  agencies  managers  etc. there are many reasons for why they could ve done what they did at the oscar s. one most likely being for publicity  for an upcoming film  sponsors  upcoming promotion  the oscar s  taking heat off of current political events  bored and wanting to start some internet drama  etc etc etc
@frappelychee  nah dude thats just stupidity talking. most likely the reason why he did it was that there was emotional build up from the events with august and his wife and all the jokes and at his expense and this was just the drop that made the bucket flow over.
@mojo  for the attention.
@tom foolery  ever heard of the bo    an gr  e
@backup368  the lousy ratings is what its all about!
his apology seemed super disingenuous tbf
@mike parker  I dont agree with either side on this one  people who say  zero chance  it was or wasn t staged are duelsional.....it very well could be real or not. we likey will never know 100  whether it was real or not.personally I think it was real  for the simple facts that neither of them are really good actors and I highly doubt the idiots at the academy would be able to come up with something like this themselves  you guys give them too much credit. also do youreally think that they would willingly create the optics of 2 black men engaged in physical violence  I doubt it.
also in response to your verse of the video  john 8 7  let he who is without sin cast the first stone. romans 3 23  for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. john 11 26  whoever believes in me shall never perish but live forever. different translations  I know but the core message remains the same.
we older kids who grew up watching will as children feel a bit different. I want will to be happy and try to salvage the rest of his life by giving jada and the rest of his woke insane kids an ultimatum that he s to be respected and that they are to control themselves. final word  no concessions.
chris rocks face after will shouted at him seemed pretty genuine too. as if his brain was working on improvising a way out of it  while having 10 producers shouting in his ear piece.
he was probably leaning in expecting will to say something discretely at worst  not a bitch slap.
may be like tom cruise jumping on the sofa at oprah some silly initiation rite in a weird club.
any press is good press for people like him  who s career  was dying for some time.
you solved it! will and chris just had a slapbet going on
what a happy slapoween.
everyone s talking about will smith and Im over here like  what about the droid attack on the wookies
my main reason for doubting it is fake is the fact that now thatsooo many people are calling for will to lose his first oscar her got after that happened they still are not admitting it was planned and therefore I doubt it is fake
passion of the croft 4 cant wait to see it!
imo the oscar s slaptastic episode is surreal.
I watched film threat s watch party last night  https   youtu.be gfrszfwsau4  and there was great discussion in the last couple of hours about this from very valid viewpoints.  chris gore  formerly of g4  is the host and on friday night tights quite often.  az from @heelvsbabyface came on and made some great points about how at the worst  it was a stunt that went wrong  because will smith is a broken man  who has trapped himself in a open marriage with a woman that publicly humiliates him time after time. he explains it better than I dochris rock has nothing to apologize for.  he made a joke  albeit a lame one  but will smith was no alpha male in his actions.  he was laughing at the joke at first anyway.  if you watch the video  rock started to pull his hand into a fist for just a moment then showed his self-control.matt walsh repeated the joke that Im thinking chris rock would have wished he could have made in a normal setting.the oscars would have been another snoozefest if not for this.  the three hosts  regina hall and wanda sykes amy schumer  who both claim to be comedians  were horrible.  amy schumer was telling stolen jokes even last night.  regina hall was manhandling men s buttocks  which apparently is ok for the women to do  but if it had been reversed...oh no!!!!  it was a typical oscars overall  with unmemorable music  space wasting montages  stupid virtue signaling in many speeches  and awards given to movies that many people had never heard of or now only on a streaming platform that most people will never pay the    to seek out and watch.the great thing about ephesians 2 8 is the reminder that we have nothing to do with our salvation.  we cant earn it and do anything to merit it.  thats a great verse melonie - one always to remember.  the following verse though is the part people forget -  not a result of works  so that no one may boast   eph 2 9  esv its funny that just as puritanical as the woke left is being  we need to always remember that there is an ever looming puritanical legalistic pharisaic right that deems that our holiness is defined by women not wearing pants or owning playing cards or going to movies or anything else man-made.  thats how I look at these all people who write in to you with little complaints about something you might say or whatever.  the difference in the puritan left and right  if there is a difference  is this the puritan right wants to impose their views on you based on things that have no support in scripture at all.  the puritan left  woke  wants to impose their secular viewpoint of what should be the current narrative in their eyes as to what is tolerable regardless of the freedoms we have under the law of the land  yet even then it is only tolerated by them until said actions behaviors happen to infringe on what their own feelings.keep on going booooooooooooom!
it doesnt matter if it was real or not  it will be used to get more people to tune in next year when some one gets the chair or the people s elbow.
the memes have been of exceptional quality. I was watching film threat stream and it was great in real time. working midnights has it perks lol.
if it was fake  there would be a  tell . throughout the whole scene chris clearly wasn t expecting it  not even a shoulder tense  and will wouldn t had laugh at the joke in the first place if it was going to be faked. and yes the full palm did hit him not the finger tips
should ve said  what did the five fingers say to the face   lol
cat   yes  I am named after a now classical jazz musician  and I try to live my life every moment by the understated coolness of --  melanie   gears of war! cat   .........very well. this is also acceptable.
I dont think it matters if it was real. itsends the message that its okay to silence someone with force when they say something that offends them. thats not cool.
if it was a bit done by the oscars to boost ratings  they wouldn t haven t cut the audio after the slap.
great ending few minutes on this one  mel.  well said.
will   keep my wife s name out your f-ing mouth  me   as soon as you keep other guys out her
the proper meme of the 2022 oscars is now we know why chris rock does not joke about alec baldwin s wife...
its as real as anything they do on-camera.and as important to me as anything they do in a restroom.
to me it looked like will was trying really hard to suppress himself from laughing...like the corners of his mouth and eyes were pointed upwards. when someone is truly angry  their mouths would be in a frown  for those that need a little more explaining . I believe it was a stagged mutual act
also  any thought on will thanking God when he received his award
also melonie have you ever seen highway to heaven. its from the 80s. I saw it as a kid  both originally aired in the late 80s and also reruns. its a great show  about johnathan smith  an angel of the Lord who goes on missions from God  and his friend mark gordon  normal human who drives around with him. michael landon plays johnathan smith and is producer and also writer of most of the episodes. he also starred in little house on the prairie and  bonanza  so you know its good tv. one of landon s parents was jewish and the other catholic  so he had a good perspective  he passed away a while back . every show has a happy ending and teaches you a spiritual lesson. this is a good one to start out with  God sends johnathan on a mission to mend the relationship between a reverend and his daughter before his daughter dies of a disease  cancer maybe  they dont say . the reverend think his daughter will go to hell because she slept with another man while she was married. johnathan explains that the daughter is a child of God  not a sinner  and she s dying and they have to mend things. https   www.youtube.com watch v k1ktjka8zve
I suggested to my dad that the oscars would become like wwe if this stunt actually gets them more ratings.
its settled then. will smith will lead the attack on kashyyyk.
the slap looked real I just wonder if it was all planned. what I loved was how she slapped the dude then said he wanted to be a vessel of love after. I swear hollyweird is weird.
so  only a minute in  but I think its real.chris rock doesnt flinch. Ive watched slap competitions for guys who get slapped hundreds of times and they always flinch.
pop quiz will smith is walking towards you  what do you do  ...what do you do
dope! lol appreciate the takes and really appreciate the scripture at the end.
thatslap looked super weird  even kind of comedic  there was also a weird thump sound not even a slap sound but the kind of sound a wwf wrestler wound make when they fake slap. basically right out of the acting on stage beginners guide.
chris rock didn t even press charges  the oscars committee is only doing an investigation due to all the woke pressure. the funniest was jim carey saying he s wanting to press charges. you know  the one who played andy kaufman  who abused and annoyed the crap out of everyone that worked with him on that movie . this would have easily been a kaufman  move to stage a slap like that. and honestly  if it wasn t for thatslap  no one would be talking about the oscars right now  and they know this.
its actually reasonable to think its staged. I personally think it was real  but its really nothing to get mad about if someone thinks its staged lol
I was that way to when I heard about it that it was a joke or a sketch or something but sense there suspending him and talking about taking his oscar away makes me think its real or the academy wouldn t be be reacting this way if it was.I do want to propose a hypothetical the slap is not only real but its revealed that wills wife jada put him up to hitting him onstage by telling him to do it or egging him on to do it when you consider the public punishment he s getting now would she be punished for anything like being charged as an accomplice
I have to really disagree with you on that take  the slap was real  there is a slow motion clip when you can see it was real   since if it wasn t they wouldn t have talked about taking his oscar prizehe laughed about the joke until his  wife  gave him the serious stare  and after thatslap he had a breakdownon other note  chris rock took it like a champ and moved on
from what Im heard is thatshe has some type of disease or something that makes her hair fall out  so I get both sides but she rolled her eyes about the joke  it did seem to hurt her a bit. will took it in another direction lol fake or not but it got people talking.
I think its real. will smith has nothing to gain from a stunt that portrays him as out of control
men used to fist fight all the time over insults and jokes. especially where will grew up  this was common. I dont condone or agree with what he did and he probably needs some help. he s barely hanging onto his marriage as it is  and I think he knew this joke would make jada spiral again. so will reacted out of fear.
I couldn t believe myself when I did see it but damn will s producer forced him to talk every time they had a commercial break after that and oof it isn t looking good
the best comment I heard on this clip was by aba   preach....it was something like this is just a set up for everyone hates chris season 4 lmao...def not fake and I could see chris was shook.
if you dont troll on twitter  your not doing twitter right.
in the words of mark twain  who was pretty far from devout   heaven goes by favor. if it went by merit  you would stay out and your dog would stay in.
I suspect it might have been a stunt to drum up ratings. it wouldn t surprise me with hollywood these days. nerderotic friday night tights introduced me to melonie  Ive just subscribed  check those guys out.
wow  melonie was born in 86  so she s 35 or 36. I thought she was in her 20 s.
it was 100  real and shameful. I never seen will smith look like that  ever. as chris rock fumbled his way through the rest of hosting set  it was obvious. it was a net negative experience for the oscars. yeah  people are talking about the slap. but they dont give a damn about anything else.
if that was fake  next year we have a full episode of celebrities death match.
turns out  everybody really does hate chris.
glad to see my sweet daddy matt walsh in this video. sbg4life
look at the australian news outlet. the american one censored the one they put up. you can see what happened during the commercial break
I know will smith is good at crying on command and what not and the slap itself looks dramatic and the way he smirked after he walked off did look suspect  but if it was fake then these duds know how to sell a punch better than pro wrestlers.  chris rock was on some next level acting when he was stumbling over his words after the incident.
I think it was real only because of the video of how will acted during commercials also because they cut the feed in america when the smack happened. I think the should hug and get over it. no harm done.
more real than will and jadas marriage  jadens gender and willows musical talent.
hey mel  love your work mate - look chiristians that get hung up on swearing really aren t worth your headspace mate. I dont recall moses writing down an appendix with a list of whatever passed for  swear  words back then  but Im pretty sure it wouldn t match what gets around today so the argument is ridiculous. it is  as Im pretty sure always has been  about intent. the big fella see s the heart - from where I sit  yours is in the right spot ma am. carry on  -
hard to believe she s the same age as matt walsh.
Im glad to hear that people cant push you away from your faith.    our faith should be based on God  and not on what other people say and do.  thumbs up edit  not that Im criticizing people who are new to their faith in Christ and are more easily swayed because they dont know any better yet.
Imean since the cops were called id say yes it was real lol
ableist  he called her bald  and hey  there s a whole other message in gI jane   dont give up  even if no one believes in you . will... or rather  jada  getting incensed over a joke is maximum petty...
d jordan b said it perfectly   only the cool  people were born in the 80 s. I was born the same year as you and enjoyed mary poppins as a kid.as a Christian myself we were taught that we re all sinners. come as you are. nobody is better then anyone. I cuss like a sailor. its unfortunately a bad habit thats been hard for me to break out of. does that make God love me less  God loves us unconditionally. does that make me a bad Christian  there s no such thing as a good or bad Christian. nobody can judge you but Jesus. God died on the cross for our sins. do some Christians forget what Jesus said before he took his last breath   forgive them father for they know not what they do.  we all sin and we re forgiven by the blood of Jesus. just remind them of that and keep being who you are.
the slap was absolutely real  the apology was insane and fake.
I think melonie s troll side is the female version of me! haha I love the sarcasm!!
another reason I believe it was real because chris rock did not go to after party. he wanted nothing to with smith. but at the end the day who cares. more important things in the world. oh by the way I went to a hockey game and the oscar s broke out!
cole train is such a great pet name.
don rickles was the master of insult comedy.  his philosophy   anyone and everything is fair game...except two things.  I will never ever make fun of children or someone s physical ailment. chris rock broke the don rickles rule and got what he deserved.  will did what any husband would do in thatsituation.
circle jerk and slap gate. happy monday to you too
Imean  it looked real to me. does that mean Im gonna get all up in my feelings because someone else has a different opinion  no lol. just because itseemed real to me  Im not excluding the very real possibility that it could have been staged. Imean both guys are good actors  and lately  the interest in the oscars have been declining since they have succumbed to wokeness   which turns most mature people off  so a publicity stunt on this level could only be beneficial to the academy.Imean look at how many people are talking about it lol. so atm  imo  I feel it was real based mostly on how bewildered chris rock looked after it happened  but I do not for one second believe that it absolutely couldn t have been one huge publicity stunt either.
itsounds more like the mic was knocked then a slap to the face to me.
yep!
she is bald because of an auto immune condition that the immune system attacks the hair follicles  and it falls out.
@02091992able  that doesnt matter. its still a joke
whether the slap was real or not  the oscar s saw a pretty nice ratings bump thanks to it. now its all people are talking about  so its a win win for them at the end of the day.p.s your dad is a chad
in the black community getting slapped by another man is way worse than being punched.  Im not entirely sure if it was fake or not but chris rock didn t seem to be acting.  if he would ve been dramatic then that would ve looked more suspicious.  I performed on stage for around 20 years.  Ive been hit a few times on stage.  some were accidental but one time was on purpose.  got punched right in the face.  I barely reacted.  my adrenaline was pumping and I was focused.  didn t even feel it until an hr after the show was over.  chris also started fumbling his words after and lost all the momentum he had.  he also started to talk back to will when he was being yelled at but stopped himself.  if it was fake then chris wasn t aware of it.
I fully agree with you!bigfoot is real!
I think it was real but I will admit that it violates default man protocol to hit another man and then turn your back on them. its a solid rule that if you hit another man you get your hands up in defense and square up... maybe will was just 100  sure he wouldn t get sucker punched back but that makes me wonder why he was so sure... fake maybe    like I said  I think it was real but I admit there s some susness around it.
I see why people are saying its fake beacuse will smith and chris rock are both actors but when you see the uncensored version will smith seemd pissed and wanted to cry
real or not. the silent awkwardness from the crowd was real enough. and the fact that we cant tell either way is bad enough as will smith just told the world that it is okay to assault a comedian on stage for telling jokes.
melonie  you should use the king james version because its more poetic and not copyrighted    somehow   but I say unto you  that ye resist not evil  but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek  turn to him the other also  sounds more poetic than  but I tell you  do not resist an evil person. if anyone slaps you on the right cheek  turn to them the other cheek also.
personally I believe it was fake but either way I truly believe that his wife put him up to it!!
its all fun and games until jada gives you the stare
the thumbnail on this video is great!
holyshit I play videogames while I hear your videos the day I pick up gears of war you mentioned you named your cat based of the game
now I have to go to twitter just so I can see your thread.  thanks...twitter angeries up my blood. thanks for the short peek at coultrain for real.
it wasn t fake  but that doesnt mean they wont use it to their advantage.
perfect raceswap of adam west and burt ward batman and robin
your dad.  high five!
if it was real or not  I dont think will should have done that in my opinion...
I believe it to have been real. though I cant be sure of it  there were two public apologies  one at the ceremony  other to mr. chris rock and other people via twitter or instagram  which to me  an european  says something about the nature of the situation  but different cultures  different modus operandI  I agree . regardless  I believe it was a culmination of bad moments for mr. will smith  who for some years now  in my most humble opinion  has been forfeiting the meaning of his first name  mostly regarding mrs. jada smith actions.  whatever might be the culmination of this  I believe mr. will smith wont be the same after this  professional and emotionally wise.
will could have straight up punched him  but he showed some restraint by slapping him. jada has an autoimmune condition that results in hair loss. the immune system pretty much attacks and fills the follicles causing your hair to fall out. she has been open about it over the last few years. I know what it is like to picked on because of a medical condition. had cancer at the age of 10 and then 3 years later tested and found to have autism. both caused other students to make fun of me in school and I didn t much care for it. one kid my senior year told me to go get cancer again  I had to show allot of restraint not to snap him in half. I do not think the news coverage shows the entire video leading up to will going up and slapping him  you can see that will is fine until he looks at jada and sees she isn t happy at all. never talk shit about someone s wife while the husband is present.
late comment so I dont know if you ll see  but re  the comment youread about how you always end up talking about tomb raider. although Im not really into tomb raider  I like when you talk about it  because youre passionate about it  and I like hearing people talk about things they are passionate about. just like how I like hearing the hijabI gamer talk about destiny even though I have zero interest in that game series  I support her passion for it.
the throttling of the view count is ridiculous. they are not lieing about the like counter yet  smash the like button. make it go boom.
slapping is actually way more disrespectful in the black community than getting punched.  ask almost any black person they ll tell you they would rather take a punch in front of people than be slapped.
I think smith pulled the slap. I dont think rock was in on it.
coletrain baby whooo! he was my favorite character in gow for some reason in pvp I would always play waaaay better when I was him
it was real. if it was a pr stunt it went horribly for will simp  just look at what was trending right next to his name on twitter
staged or not  its obvious that will was faking his outrage. and its obvious why. he s trying to stay on his wife s good side despite her persistent cheating. its really sad  actually.
check out the video on it by lotus eaters - explains the context which makes one feel rather bad for will
12 58 - Im pretty sure there s a couple verses from the Bible that pertain to those types of people  these are paraphrased and probably a bit out of order  but I think the core message is still in them   dont try to remove the splinter in someone else s eye if you cant see past the log inside your own  - matthew 7 5  I think itsays something like that let he who is without sin cast the first stone  john 8 7  maybe  I googled itso  take it with a grain of saltnone of us are without sin so none of us have the right to cast judgement  at least the condemning kind  upon people.  Im also pretty sure if someone had their soul purified of their sin  they would have more sympathy for those that haven t because purging sin from one s soul is no easy process  some of the time.  plus  Im pretty sure somewhere in the Bible it mentions how man s  not just referring to men the ladies aren t above this either  much to their chagrin in some cases  judgement at its very best is faulty
I liked andrew garfield s reaction the best.
yep it was real
I find it interesting that mr. smith was laughing at the joke  then decides to make an issue out of it. was it real  a calculated move for publicity  or he took as disrespectful to himself  I wonder if someone other than a major star acted in such a manner if they would have been ejected from the proceedings
there s just so much celebrity drama and privilege. the narcissism is through the roof with them. melonie  I would not want to cross your dad!
hypocrite! first get rid of the log in your own eye  then you will see well enough to deal with the speck in your friend s eye.   matthew   7 5   nlt  its about your relationship with the Lord  not about what others think itshould be.  if youre producing good fruitstanding next to the river  then you should believe youre doing your best.
I can definitely see it being a publicity stunt  what with the shock comedy and radical virtue signalling happenning these days  but with the investigation of smith and the choice to forego the after party from rock  I would say this was probably not staged.
lmao!!! mel xdddd  the tone in 911  Im totally not saying that!   xdddd
walk in God s path my friends and dont be easily lead astray! amen
its not fake its dragged on for too long.
I dont think we need to add hate or police to the situation. will humiliated himself so bad an apology is enough for me imo
there was a new zealander sitting right behind will smith and she said it was real will smith was really angry and it wasn t a stunt and she was absolutely disgusted and what he done but I want to raise an interesting question we hear about the cancel culture how come people habe not asked for will smith to never act  in a film again Im sensing a double standard coming. but even one commentator said that everyone in the audience was supporting will smith because the academy never escorted him out of the building as if they were condoning what he had done instead of condemning. itseems that violence is the only way to solve your issues.
look out for fresh prince s new slappy single  simps just dont understand
its okay if you talk about tomb raider. I always try to squeeze final fantasy on any topic about media.
I think it was real  but I dont care what anyone else thinks  its not the big of a deal  nobody will be talking about this in a day or two
explain.
@audiogardenslave  what  you didn t see the meme of him on his phone texting when the whole thing went down  I loved it.
@shandI nicole beard  nope  but itsounds like me in high school everytime a fight went down cause I was always looking the wrong way or listening to music. always caught the tail end of the fights.
he was laughing until jada started rolling her eyes at him.  they way she jerks him around is amazing.  where is his pride   let s not even talk about how she put his son in a dress.
@mark brooks  nah he just missed his cue
@mark brooks  not only is he in a dress  he is dating tyler the creator. like....

@theseusminor  doesnt change my opinion. well it depends on how hard the slap is lmao
yeah  if that was real it was pathetic. open hand slap for a loud sound  but not much of a hit. a real slap would have had rock rubbing his cheek and massaging his jaw afterwards. if he had backhanded rock  then you would know he meant it. and then will incorporated it into his acceptance speech  on the fly   yeah  right. will might be able to deliver lines  but writing and improve are definitely not his strong suits.
ya I think it was real  the slap itself was weak and clearly he didn t want to hurt chris rock well either that or will smiths a bitch. that being said I dont know if he was drunk but either way it was not warranted  if he had a problem with the joke he would have done just as good a job simply vocalizing his frustrations.
totally real. unless its setting up men in black 4. just a guess by trash.  d
I dont understand why anyone would get mad about someone else s opinion on this  but I definitely dont think it was fake  because neither of them had anything to gain by doing that as a publicity stunt.  thatsaid  will smith was an idiot for slapping him and his crocodile tears during his speech were up there with some of his worst acting in his career.
for it to be fake would require acting tallant.
words are words  its the context they are used in that matters. God tells us not to curse  take his name in vain or let any unwholesome speech come from our mouth. on the same coin he said its not your place to judge. so probably best to go touch some grass and leave folks alone lol.
matt walsh is a savage.  gotta watch out for this Christians
I agree that it is probably a pr stunt.  the oscars ratings have tanked so much due to all the wokeness that they are trying to be outrageous to gain views.  of course  it could be real  but I dont believe these people know how to be genuine  so I lean towards them being their manipulative selves.
ironic that a bad comedian cant take a joke. also he slaps like a five year old. however real or fake the issue with this is the fact thatsmith wanted to run for office. dont forget how he acts when he s on a ballet.
what are people still skeptical  I understand but just look at the entire clip. there s a reason we have to look at japanese and australian tv to see it.
Im a bit a late to watching this  however  Imust respectfully disagree in that outside of the context of salvation -- which is completely correct  case in point the verse -- you are not trash.  no one is trash.  I d even go as far so to say thatsuch thinking contributes to fueling the great heresy of our day   nihilism.  you are rare and precious and beautiful in the sight of God  cf. gn. 1 31 .  like a star in the heavens  there is none like you  and like the stars in the heavens  each with its role to play within creation  as do you.  yes  original sin has removed us from the grace of God  which is restored only by the mystery of the waters of baptism and the holy trinity  with the exception of its stain  but we also we must recall the scripture where God says   before I formed you in the womb I knew you  before you were born I set you apart .  and  why   as scripture continues  to  appoint you prophet to the nations .  now  perhaps we are not gifted such a grace in the literal context of jeremiah  but the point is you are not meaningless  without purpose  trash.  quite to the contrary as by virtue of baptism  we are all priests  prophets  and kings to Jesus Christ  and in this context  we find example in what is written in jeremiah.   salvation  of course  is continuous in that we cannot cease in seeking it out as not only do we still sin  we are prone to sin resulted from the stain of original sin thatso imperfects creation  not to mention the devil   but we must not forget that each and every one of us is created in the image and likeness of God  gn. 1 27   whom which is the source of all holiness.  this means that by our very nature we are holy  we are good  like God  that is from the decisions that we make  and the actions we carry out derived from those decisions  that define us as the good or bad people we are.  if you were trash  then john 3 16 would not be true.  indeed  God loves you  and through that love  we receive that gift of grace should we choose it.
and yes  saved by grace though faith. even a  works based  catholic like me get s that. lolbut  seriously  where st. paul also said to the philippians   wherefore  my dearly beloved   as you have always obeyed  not as in my presence only  but much more now in my absence   with fear and trembling work out your salvation. for it is God who works in you  both to will and to accomplish  according to his good will. and all of you do all things without murmurings and hesitations  that you may be blameless  and sincere children of God  without reproof  in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation  among whom you shine as lights in the world.   phil. 2  12 -15 now this is the same st. paul that taught us that we are saved by grace through faith. is he also saying that Christianity is  works based   by no means so! but who are we baptized into  in the name of the father  the son  and the holy spirit. who do we dedicate out life to when we become a Christian  to God. we proclaim to be children of God  and what good work we do is by  through  and for God. so as children of God  we are called to holiness. does it mean we always live up to it  no  but we are always striving to do better. for me as a catholic  this is where confession comes in. its a way for me to kind of fess up to God where I have fallen short in my life. a  priest thats good at hearing confessions often takes this time to offer some spiritual advise and moral support  as well as the penance and absolution at the end. sometimes its nice when they suggest a scripture to read while doing penance that may help focus on what it is God calls us in general to do in following him in this newness of life that began with our salvation. holiness is not a one time thing that you do  and then youre done. its a path that we start on when we have been saved. this path is not easy  but by  with  and through God working in us  the burden is light. some say God will not give us more than we can handle  but  like a good spotter while weight lifting  he might add on a few more pounds to push our limits a bit  and help us grow. fortunately  God doesnt give everyone the job workout regiment. but even if we do wind up facing more struggles than most  we have to remember that God is in charge  and he will help get us through the storms of life  and more so lead us on to that greater life to come.
I think your right it looked fake.also  solo gratia indeed!
I say its a work staged. they clearly wanted to improve ratings from last year and they got that. couple that with will laughing at the start  and him giving chris a creampuff slap that rock was prepared for.
diditfortheoscars
slapgate is something I just dont care about.  let the rich do whatever they want to each other. if it was real or fake. makes no difference to me.
either way its a terrible look for an already-fading hollywood. if its staged  it means the oscars have gotten so uninteresting that they had to steal a chappelle s show skit from nearly 20 years ago to generate interest  what did the 5 fingers say to the face  . if its real  then hollywood s reaction is completely and utterly tone deaf to reality. they think they are Lords above all of us peasants. if anyone reading this comment did what will did at a comedy show  comedians are known for doing crowd work so Im guessing someone reading this has been roasted before  we  in the best case scenario  would be kicked out of the event and banned from the venue. most likely there d be charges involved. but they let will stay  win an award  and still give a televised speech. so either way  hollywood is trash. end rant.
oh  it was real
what many Christians dont get about cussing is its all about context. Jesus said all of the law and prophets hang on two commands  love the Lord your God with all your heart  mind and strength  and love your neighbor as yourself.for every transgression the context is love.  if you stub your toe and yell  f @ !  are you being unloving  no. but if you tell someone  f @  you  then you are likely being unloving  and therefore transgressing. and I would use the actual word  but I want to make the point without triggering sensitivities.
growing up in my neck of the woods if someone didn t get slapped in the first 5 minutes of a party you weren t doing it right lol twatter weirdos gon  be twatter weirdos.
so a main actor from I  robot  not only has a wife and kids  but can slap another comedian and actor. clearly he isn t a robot limited by the three laws!
remember everyone  vote for w. smith... he s human too!
lol  people talking about a thing they didn t watch after it happened is not ratings.
@rory c. mahan  there s a live ratings graph going around on social media and itspiked to an extreme degree after the incident.
dont take offense if someone says youre not a good Christian because there is no such thing. we dont serve and abide to God because we are good Christians  we serve and abide because we are sinners.
you are so pg I dont see how anyone could get offended. legalism is not only destructive it completely misses the point of the gospel. sure people use  liberty  as an excuse to do things they know they shouldn t do  but jumping down someone s throat over a mildly naughty word  or even an unambiguous f-bomb said in a moment of passion  shows completely misaligned values.  spicy language  is like spicy seasoning. too much ruins the dish  but just a little can add much needed flavor to an otherwise bland meal.
just say  I am a work in progress !!!
its real. the lapd issued a statement about it. the cops dont have time to play pranks with the public.
you are pg  but you are not will smith pg.
its not a question of grace its the idea of the spring has one kind of water  either salty or sweet not both. you have a public platform and put yourself out here as a representative and ambassador of a holy God  its not about judgement the fruit is visible for all to see. thats why its the narrow path and not the broad road
every single one of us  are not trash. we are all God s children aren t we  do all Christians think that God s children are trash
slapgate is a  work .
it was 100  real but Im not mad. you ll see soon enough. they are talking about the academy taking official action against smith.
woo its the cole train baby!
5 22  oh my gosh Im about to censor this comment . then scrolls so the picture moves
cole train 1 mel s shirt 0
you know what I think   it was a slap!!!  end of discussion.
yeah I do think its real only because you can see the camera crew freak out and it also lead to a nip slip later in the night which is super not worth any pr
what did the 5 fingers said to the face....slap..unityyyyyy
if will smith had been an airplane  the twin towers would still be standing with barely a scratch  p
coltrane for host !
canadian here! wondering if you could do a video on our primeminister justin trudeau at some point. I am a libertarian conservative and a Christain but want someone like you who understands the culture to comment on it. not sure what you could talk about but would love to here a free americantell me about oru crappy censorship bills and what your thoughts are. I know my comment is convoluted so I ll leave it at that lol.
the  last time the internet had this much of an uproar roar it was about thatstupid dress that was either black and blue or white and gold
we have the same cat. what s its name
Im a Christian and I dont think that. what melonie means is that we re all sinners  and we all need God s help to redeem us and save us from our sins  which are destructive to us and to others.
no one will ever know... they re actors on a stage after all.
the first thing I thought of was   this is fake . the oscars are such trash they needed something to make it go viral for something other than how bad it was. you are not alone with this theory .
yes its bad publicity for will
at first I thought it was not real but I found out it was real. I watched the full uncensored version. will laughed at the joke  noticed his wife was upset at it then got angry  stormed up and slapped him  a little girl s slap  he really needs to learn to slap better  lol  then stormed back to his seat and then with angry tears in his eyes  emotionally said keep my wife s name out of your ducking mouth. he said that 2-3 times. the other actors actresses thought it was all a stunt as well  they were laughing  until he said what he said  then stopped laughing . they ended up hugging it out during a commercial break and made public apologies online to each other and will pubicly apologized to the academy  producers of the show  all the attendees and everyone watching around the world  as well as the family of tennis stars venus and serena williams and those involved with the film for which he won his best actor award. police got in contact with chris and asked if he wanted to press charges and he said no. the academy condemned will s actions and launched a formal review as well. thats all the info Imanaged to find. edit  turns out the chris rock apology to will smith was not real  it was a fake apology created by someone else.
total pr stunt  he doesnt actually hit him and chis  reaction is not that of someone who actually got a surprise slap. they just needed people to start talking about the oscars again cause no one cares anymore.
it was a real slap  but scripted. chris rock leans in and braces for the slap and then goes with the slap as he is  slapped . Ive watched wrestling for way too long and have seen harder slaps lol
ok so that first guy  if you thought the war in ukraine was unexpected  exactly how far into the sand has your head been buried for the past 12 years
my grandma got called a b tch once when I was a kid.  she told my grandpa when he came home.  he went to that mans house and told him dont ever call my wife any derogatory names ever again and if you do  it will be the last time   that guy never said another word to my grandma.  this is how you handle this situation.  you give them a warning and if the fell to heed it then you take it to another level.  my grandpa was a great God fearing man  that no one he knew ever heard him cuss  or even say a slang word  he didnt smoke drink  talk bad about people  always helped out friends and family  never judged  and always tried to do what was right no matter what other people thought.  he had principals and he stood by them.  this is how I was raised and I agree with this to this day after growing up as an adult and learning principals and morals for myself.  if he would have beat that dude up the first time I would have not had respect for what he did.  the way he handle it is how anyone should handle it.
mean words justify beatingl take tbh
people love a titillating drama.
hey melonie  have you checked your emails recently  you have a gift waiting. enjoy!
thats what I was wondering  the room is full of actors and actresses  they are literally paid to do stunts like this  guerilla marketing  is still a thing
zoomers  what the fuck is a bowling alley
I was enjoying watching your cat and you upsetting him poor coltrane poor wee cat cant even malt in peace now youre lucky coltrane didn t learn from will smith. p.s. let s cancel will smith what s 1 less actor in the world   a better place.
fluffy mcflufferson.
chris rock did nothing wrong and people nowadays are too soft
chris isnt that good of an actor mel. if so they gave the wrong person the best actor award. grats on 30k
thanks for reminding us we are trash. all of us.
no one cared about the oscars  and now everyone is talking about it  that right there has the answer.
sad attempt by smith to try to impress his husband so he doesnt sleep with august after the show.
melonie you are under the electron microscope  if you burp  people will say look she is not a Christian  she burped the wrong way. always remember we are to pray for those that hate us. its hard but commanded by our Lord. I know nobody cares what I say  but you are human not perfect  like all of the human race. keep up the mission God has laid on your heart! you are always in my prayers. oh I was married in 1986 yes I am a true boomer a good year. so I will always know your age. lol
I dont believe anything these hollywood actors do is legitimate. the net effect has been people are now talking about the oscars for once... coincidence
commenting to feed the algorithm
I agree  its completely fake. and twitter sucks.
it didn t look like it connected. thatsaid if it were real then the right response would ve been for will smith to go up there crack a joke about jada being bald  mention her cheating and mic drop on   metoo bitch .
bigfoot s definitely real
kitty cute.
it was faked.  in fact had this not happened no one would be talking about the oscars now
sin boldly
melonie have you played max payne series and sleeping dogs
your dad is based af. that warranted getting decked. chris rock s lame joke didn t.
heh mel looking for them views cant blame ya mate you gotta do what u gotta do
it was staged i.e they let it happen ..its the oscars  they are all actors. no different to wwe. I also doubt anyone  even other actors can just walk on stage with out security or someone  stopping them at the oscars. it wasn t like smith was running to the stage. so  some diversity hire producer told security to back off as they  probably thought it would be a cool bit of drama to get some media attention and internet clicks. it wouldn t surprise me if the producer got a pay raise. also also after the  slap  why was he not escorted from the room  he was able to sit back down and yell at chris rock. to those who say why would will smith do this to his career I say ..lets not forget he did put his name to that cringe 2018 yt  rewind video.and great verse to choose and your take on ephesians was spot on.keep up the good work!
well just dont talk about it no more. this time next week itshould be forgotten.the social question is  is this what you do
will and slap is a bunch of nonsense  keep crushing itsister
you stay away from twitter young ladydo not take the mark of the beast!
its a publicity stunt
those people dont get it  your argument is that it wasn t unexpected not that unexpected   staged  straw men argument.
troll the twitter mob! reeeeeeeeeee!!!
no it was not fake. this is just what simps do
fooking fake slap.  just like in the movies.if you look close you see chris  waiting for thatslap to happen.
thatshit was faker than wwe.
jada pinkett smith isn t just someone s wife - she s a celebrity in her own right and thus  a valid roasting target. I think chris was actually trying to give her a compliment as being compared to demImoore in the  90s is not even a roast. demI was considered the hottest actress in hollywood back then. what s all this crap about defending his wife s honour - what are we cavemen all of a sudden  what happened to the gentle woke hollywood we ve come to know  turns out it all goes out the window if its not convenient to the narrative. at least they didn t break out the glocks.
gears of paw
it was fake as the award show itself or to be more clear  as real as the wwf in the 80s.
it was a pr stunt. completely staged
not real. do I really care about the 1 !!! twitter lost its mind.
is totally fake. he braced for impact seconds before it ever happens.
coldtrain iz teh best co-host evah!        erm... sorry cat was on the keyboard.  hi.
I think its fake also  but to be honest I dont really give a turd  I stopped watching the oscars award shows when I was a kid hell I haven t even watched television in  over 12 years. it doesnt speak to me or appeal to me whatsoever. I prefer the old stuff not weak ass woke stuff  ive found I have this in common with a lot of people born in the 80s I was born in 87.
the important part  is no one really cares and will be forgotten by next week.
I say the f word  hard  uck  all the time. you could easily be raunchy  and not talk about God and be more popular. but you dont and its heckin impressive.
black chris rock made a joke about black will smith s black ratchet ho woman.black will smith slapped black chris rock.the oscars did nothing about it and even let black will smith get an award later.there s clearly one thing we can learn from this incident.the oscars are fully in support of black on black violence.   lol
will smith is a mixed bag. he wants to be a tough guy one moment and the next he crying on stage while getting a trophy. I can get into a whole discussion about this topic  because there s layers to it. was the joke chris rock said even his joke or a joke written for him  chris rock did do a documentary called  good hair  back in 2009 about black women chemically burning their scalps to straighten their hair. so you can conspires about that coming into play for staging it for awareness. either way  Im not a slapping man. slapping is something a woman does. considering it was all in jest makes it less of an offense than a direct insult. hollyweird is weird.
the russia ukraine war was 100  expected... our white house warned about it 2 weeks before hand.. partially because they helped ukraine provoke it but thats besides the point.  dudes analogy was 100  wrong
hImelonie  dont know whether you are going to read this and Im probably going to face  public embarrassment  but so be it. I know you and brittany ventI are friends   and if youreally care about her  you will atleast tell her about Jesus and bring her to Christ. I would have chosen to tell you privately but  why hide it   let s face it  anything can happen  I just watched a video of a woman being dragged from her vehicle and dying afterwards  the last thing I want is a video one day where you are in tears  with the title my best friend is gone  and you feel guilty about not bringing her to Christ. I wish things where different  but they are only two fates after death  heaven or hell. if you tell her the truth and she hates you for it  you can blame me and expose me. ask yourself where would she go  when she dies  and if she goes to the worst place possible  would you want her to tell God  thatshe wasn t told about him. at least let her soul have a safety net. and no stop telling yourself you are a pushover for telling her the truth or you are forcing Christianity  hate me if you want to  but just remember life is short  we can be here one day and just suddenly gone tomorrow. tomorrow could always be too late  at least talk to her during the weekend.
fake.
9 11 was. you should be saying that.
twas not real in my humble opinion.
I think I dont care no really just another reason to not watch the oscars they cant even fight properly
I thought it was real. will smith is not that good an actor.
it was a cheap rip off of  rick james slap . cold blooded.
indeed we are all trash. thats why baptism begins with our death since we re in agreement with God s judgment on the flesh.
acted and orchestrated!!! and there are people actually believing trump had something to do with it!!! lololol
I think it looks fake  cuz will smith is weak af.
fake so fake. also  coletrain!!!!!
first
hey  mel. we will not get into heaven thru our works. we can never be good enough. but Jesus put himself on the cross for our sins  and as long as we believe that  we are forgiven.
hey melonie by the way thatslap was shown on tv from the oscars last night that chris rock deserve thatslap bc he should not make fun of will smith s wife like that and should not make fun of jada smith s bald head like that  ok melonie. anyway what if someone make fun of chris rock s voice and his size  anyway I do not think it is right to make fun of someone else and their health condition like that  ok. I just want to say bout this topic  ok melonie. anyway I do hope you agree with me on this topic  ok. I hope you have a wonderful   great blessed evening at home with your pets and have a good night too  ok melonie.
ah yes  religion. the glorified the land of fiction. where every God exists because someone has faith that they exist. no need for proof here. faith is the only thing you need here. and dont you dare disagree with my beliefs because there s a bad place for you there that I have faith exists. probably.
and  saying  eff  and  circle jerk  is haram!!!!
amen
