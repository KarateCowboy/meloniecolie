the art style certainly helps make her look unattractive. looks like a completely different character
in several tmnt stories  april is portrayed as a bold  sexy and funny woman. I see no advantage in her with this appearance  that tries so hard to run away from any sensuality.
april even lost a couple of cup sizes there... figures.
april was already short-haired back in 2014 when they  killed  donatello. however  she wasn t drawn like your  cool but single 40yo aunt
mad respect mel  your recent political takes have been great. your firebrand style is what the world needs today.
first hand  working in the game industry having centrist views is pretty exhausting. I enjoy hearing your opinions for this exact reason  like oh man Im not alone! wish I could find more people like this in the industry to be friends with.
personally  I think catwoman can look good with either long or short hair. she did have long hair in one form or another right up  til the mid- 90 s  and looked pretty good with it most of the time - and  of course  one cant forget michelle pfeiffer and her gorgeously frizzy blonde locks. but I will admit that in the past few decades  thatshort cut has been pretty iconic to her.
you nailed it when you described the cut as  androgynous . that was the first word that came to my mind when I saw the image too. if you didn t say it was april  I would not even have recognized her as that character. I would have thought it was some new character they were introducing. the  laundry day  clothes dont fit april either.
idw s tmnt series was  to me  one of the best comics out there up to issue 100. it was around then that things began to change.everything good changes nowadays...
we wouldn t want teenage boys to find women attractive  would we
I will always be partial to april in tmnt in the 1990 movie. I had a crush on her before I was old enough to know what that was. she was beautiful aaand fit the character perfectly. its too bad that they didn t use her as reference for the comic version.
it wasn t enough to simply race-swap april since her original was mixed to begin with and as such  did not have as much backlash as they were probably hoping. they have to gradually tone her down  starting with frumpier clothing and hair then work their way to a complete redesign.
80s april all the way. I have no idea what they re doing. next thing you know  splinter will be wearing pants.
my ex got this cut towards the end of our relationship.  I had to swallow my disgust and be like yea   it looks great.  she had long beautiful red hair she buzz cut one side of her head and did something similar   she went from a solid 10 to a 8 in one hour lol.
see  this is why Im gonna stick with classics
haircut aside  I didn t know you could also get your eyes widened  thighs thickened and fupa enlarged in a simple stop by the salon. look  I dont care that they redesign things. Imean the turtles look ridiculous in those panels too. what I have a problem with is that everything always moves only in one direction. you will never see squirrel girl  stop by the salon  and come out with her teeth fixed  her belly flat  her rear end peached and long styled hair.
well of course they made her uglier. we cant have feminine characters in movies  tv shows  comics and games.
love the channel. I haven t watched streams or seen the first channel yet I was graced with this one. informative  passionate  especially about lara croft whom I also grew up with   and a Godly message. its been years since I was able to have so many things bundled into an awesome package.
talking good looking women with short hair   ada wong. I loved playing ada in re6.
I feel like looking at how they could have made the new design work is kind of a waste of time because the very existence of the new design is predicated upon it not working
if someone wasked me who that was I d have no clue. april o neil had a very specific look that anyone could tell right away.
it is a diffirent charc thats not april o neil.
they made her a ninja in tmnt adventures and the audience responded fairly well to it. it only made sense as she was constantly in danger and she knew a ninja master who taught four proteges. they really did not have many places to go to try to make a shocking statement.
@eatwave  my whole life that Ive known april she was a hot badass ninja reporter always thought it was cool this is just an unnecessarily dumb decision that adds nothing to the character or universe
easier to draw
@peter h  I draw as a past time an ugly character isn t  easier  to draw unless youre exclusively an artist that focuses on those kinds of characters especially if youre trying to change the appearance of an already existing character that creates more work and requires more effort this was simply unnecessary and ridiculous
@peter h   as an art enthusiastic and friend to and actual artists. I can confidently say  ugly characters art much harder to draw than normal characters  simply because its much harder to point out their shape language because they re so boring annoying to look at. simple characters is easy to draw  avatar the last airbender  but ugly characters isn t
@peter h   quasimodo is an example. in the show he is ugly  yet pleasing to see doe to good shape language. an excellent design I say  yet when you try to draw him its near impossible to make him look as pleasant as in the show  you would always draw abomination instead of quasimodo. thats how difficult it is to draw ugly characters. if you want easier to draw. I recommend simplify the characters design. not uglify them. dont make them boring to look at. avatar the last airbender is an excellent example.
not in the mirage source material
@eatwave  the artist plagiarized ariel from the little mermaid
@tyron leung  which artist are youreferring to  I will assume that you are not claiming that an animated adaptation of a mirage comic made in 1987 plagiarized a disney movie from 1989 so are you talking about someone who did freelance work for archie comics for their recursive adaptation  mike kazaleh  dean clarain  who
imagine my shock xd
ugh april wasn t the over sexualized damsel caricature she was in the 87 cartoon the  mirage comics april wasn t a bombshell lol
idk which ones youre talking about cause obviously you never read the entire run of the mirage source material
@tyron leung  if I had not read them  that would be completely irrelevant in the information age. there is no image archived on any wikI that is going to display an april o neil who looks like ariel to begin with let alone time travel being necessary to facilitate such a thing. if there was a strong enough resemblance  viacom would sue disney for plagiarism  not the other way around  not that they could sue anyone for something that occurred before they owned the intellectual property  anyway .
@eatwave  the issue where april becomes a ninja herself and carries a katana in the archie adventures series strikingly looks like disney ariel from the litte mermaid
@tyron leung  a single such image does not constitute plagiarism of a character. I do not even see what it had to do with my pointing out thatshe was depicted as an urban ninja in the archie comics adaptation at all. maybe it would have been better directed at the artist responsible for the image rather than random people on the internet.
Im not understanding the body shaming of april o neil  especially when april has looked different in almost every tmnt iteration.
Ive worked in silicon valley and had a similar experience. Ive taken the political compass every year for almost ten years now. it consistently puts me around x 1 y -1. I find that left-wing extremists tend to look at me  standing in the center. and they are like clockwork  rather than saying  he s so far to the right of me  Im such a left wing extremist!  they say  he s a right wing extremist!
relatable.Ive been at  redacted  for a little more than 8 years now and it keeps getting worse and worse. thankfully I got a few level headed coworkers.I dont mind the studio or producers having a progressive point of view  I just dont like the hostility to anyone who s not toeing the line... and Im a bit of a loudmouth  I gotta watch myself lol.at first I wrote the name of the company but Im not taking that risk. we re contractually forbidden tot alk negatively about the company and I have a rent to pay lol.
@karatecowboy  thats about where I am politically too. I dont think many people realize we re all paying taxes for this thing  and all need the things we care most about within reason to be represented while still being respectful of differing opinions. that doesnt seem extremist to me  in fact I d say itseems pretty freakin reasonable. but their eco chamber says otherwise so whatever.
@geist  haha  totally understand. I was at treyarch doing concept starting in 2015  and I felt safe to express my views... for the most part. I left in 2018  but I d hope it hasn t changed much. it was many closer industry friends from different studios that by the time 2019 hitseemed to be drawing harder and harder political lines  and parroting whatever mainstream media said without much question. it was exhausting. but! now Im building my own game studio  almost got a game finished  and I daydream about expanding my team with a bunch of awesome like minded people
I thought she had short hair in frank miller s year one  I could be wrong though as its been years since I read it.
@lokI trickster g  no  youre right  she did  and that probably helped popularize the look later on - but it was very much an exception to the rule at the time. if you look at the other comics thatshe was appearing in back then  Im pretty sure her hair was mostly in a longer  do.
yeah after they killed off donatello I kind of tuned out of the series. but  did enjoy how it went from silly to becoming darker like it did.
@joseph michaels  the adventurous joe   what  donatello s not dead  he had a near-death experience and had his consciousness moved to a robot  but he returned to his regular body again by issue 50.
@thomas fredrickson  its been a while since I kept up with the comic due to covid and not being able to get the books at my local comic shops. is the image they are talking about before or after issue 100  because I was looking this up online and I have seen some people say this is an old image and not recent. looking at the image it kind of looks like a picture after they saved leonardo from shredder and kitsune brainwashing. when they were out on april farm. if this is from the an old story then people are overexxagerating over an old image  making this into a woke issue when it is not. its just bad art
@sonny woods  the post-mutant containment zone art is bad for all the humans  to be fair. especially the new art for the past 3-4 issues. the story is really good and the mutants look distinct  sometimes too hard to tell male from female thought .
this image of april is from issue 31  my man.
yeah  100 is where Ive likewise drawn the cutoff point. up till then  I considered the idw series the gold standard for tmnt comics  even if there were things like this that in retrospect were hints of what to come.but after issue 100 - with the change in lead writer - the comic has gone from being a ninja turtles superhero comic to being a  current year soap opera for furries  with a heavy side order of modern social issues.
@joseph michaels  the adventurous joe   the turtles always been that dark in its roots  those responsible  of making them goofy slap stick childish heroes censoring the ninja aspect were the complaining parents groups foreign markets   87 cartoon babyfied and watered down  the turtles love for beer and violence   the heck are you talking about. have you not read one issue of the mirage tmnt books  kevin eastman simon bisleys raphael   casey jones spin off book body count or image tmnt vol.3   idw urban legends run   last ronin with the foot shooting don and splinter down with arrows   idw main comics where bebop and rocksteady smashed in his carapice with a sledge hammer is not the first time donatello was killed grewsomely  mortally injured or the turtles like don in particular has killed. donatello landed the killing final blow to oroku sakI the shredder in  1 of the mirage comics knocking him of a cliff of a roof  with the termite bomb in an attempt at suicide bombing  donatello stabbed a triceraton in the gut with his broken bo staff  donetello shot up a foot elite guard with a mac 10  donatello was ambused by oroku pimiko and cyborgs he was shot up  he fell from great heights from out of a helicopter down to the concrete and paralyzed and  lost his shell and became a cyborg from the nano technorganic technology from the dying cyborg he took with h8m trying to save splinter from being kidnapped.
@thomas fredrickson  donatello died a couple of times before in the image comics becoming a cyborg
based
only ms marvel can droll over some bland himbo.
sad  but true
dreaded male gaze.
april wasn t always that yellow jumpsuit bimbo from the 87 cartoon smh
you know judith has a youtube channel on here
@phantom wolverine figure  I did not! I ll check it out. thanks
bahaha!
which 80 s april  the mirage comics source material or the damsel  caricature  from the pizza junkie cartoon
@tyron leung  cartoon.
@galadrius the mighty  she isn t  portrayed like that in any other incarnation so stop with the nostalgia goggles most incarnations she s like her mirage counterpart.
@die with fezzy  sounds like youre projecting cause youre crying over the fred wolf incarnation of news reporter april who s a far departure from the source material
@die with fezzy  youre pretty much out of the loop with the ninja turtles franchise only viewing it from rose tinted nostslgia goggles for the kiddie turtle mania in the late 80s early 90s from the success of its childish saturday morning cartoon playmates toys archie adventures series and live action movie incarnation. go read the o.g. mirage comics april doesnt wind up romantically with casey and by the time vol 4 comes around she shaves her hair off and goes on a journey of self discovery finding out shes not human but a living drawing of the crystal her room mate jack kirby uses in donatello micro series and if vol4 got its conclusion wrap up she would ve gotten cheated on by casey having an affair with karaI if the book officially continued and casey wound up with other women such as gabrielle and an asian chick in body count
@tyron leung  nostalgia  mf I ain t even live in the 80s  but I d rather see her than whatever the fuck kinda mutant that is.
@melonie mac go boom  megan

an 8   I could tolerate a lot from an eight  but not if she started as a 10.
I wouldn t have lied. I can live with a gf gaining weight or something but if a woman pulls that cutting long beautiful hair short thing on me  I d be like no  girl. unless it really does look great lol
thats bs  but ok. I see a bunch of shows and movies thatsay otherwise. I chuck it up to just bad art  or at least bad compared to the original.
@kicknowledge smith  babs bunny  the female m m  the charmed sisters in the reboot. I could list much more of characters that have been rebooted to be less feminine. probably one of the few iconic women that wasn t majorly changed in terms of sex appeal was wonder woman.
@kicknowledge smith  someone has been living under a rock then
@ryan wood  if you say so  I see plenty of shows and movies that give women sex appeal. many way too focused on mainstream stuff and social media.
@nick napolI that pic of april o neil being allegedly  uglier  is from years ago  but people are acting like this is something new. just to show you that the people who complain about comics being  woke  dont actually read comics.
@reality shifter  she s still not attractive  but then  none of the humans have been drawn like normal for years. except angel and shredder. casey has a serious gonk face now.
she shaved her head in the mirage source material finding out she s not a human but a living creation of jack kirby s magic crystal and is incapable of bearing children.
yes ada is a perfect example!
@reality shifter  exactly and this isn t the first time april cut her hair she cut it all off in the mirage source material after her trip from the past becoming a roach with renet being raped by roaches and finding out she isn t human but a living drawing of the magic crystal that brought to life jack kirby s art work in donatello micro series
its not her  new  design. she currently has long hair. the art still isn t in her favor  but its not in any human s favor.
I always say  long hair best hair  but tbh its largely because Im jealous  I cant grow out the full luscious locks like I used to  and I just want to live vicariously through everyone else. lol
today I found out that the picture was from a tmnt comic and not fan art.  glad you brought up ladies rocking the short hair in the 90s.  youre right if they have the facial structure for it they should rock it.  glad you like that anecdote  I found it too funny not to share.  just wish I had got the edit in on  your before the screen capture.  may your day be blessed.
this isn t first time we done april with a pixie cut like this. the limited series casey and april had april with a similar short hair style  but like pointed out  there was layers with the hairstyle that also gave her hair character. while I dont think the new is bad  it can and has been  done better.
very nice to see you dont fall into group think regardless of the group   keep being yourself !!! massive respect for you !!!
I remember april being covered from neck to feet in a yellow jumpsuit and white boots.. she was literally a yellow stump with hair. so thats what they attack
mel. it is sad that they changed april as in one the forgot she was a news reporter. look at news and tell me most of the women very beautiful feminine looking women. also  I love that you brought up lara and being very alpha and doing what she wants so much that I like they showed that as flaw in shadows of tomb raider when she got into argument with jonah  I loved his character . she was so focused on mission she forgot to see people needed help and she felt bad when she realized it. you could see in plane she felt bad for yelling at jonah. jonah and her love each other like siblings but I like that they showed lara is still human and has flaws.
I really like the idw tmnt comics run. admittedly I have fell a little behind in my reading of them but they re really the only mainstream comics I still read. I cant say Im digging this but none the less looking forward to the conclusion of tmnt the last ronin which is the best thing the mainstream comic book industry has published in years. I do find it interesting though how in the last ronin story arc april is supposed to be portrayed as older but the artists made her look like a meth addict. other than that  great story.
you know  I could totally see natalie portman portraying joanna  perfect  dark really well
I so enjoy melonie s rants!
this was a particularly good episode for me. I like what you said about asking God for guidance and then it being on us to obey once God show us the way. not obeying is definitely a flaw I have but I hope to improve. also they really need to stop trying to improve tmnt. love your show! boom!
april was the boss in the house. the new april looks like a helpless baby.
at 4 23. if the real reason for the change was to make her look realistic I find it humorous they would do it in a comic about mutant turtles.
just wow...thats just not the april we know and love.  I hate to say it  but they ll probably make casey weak in some way next.  you are right though about some girls with pixie cuts  I remember a few from back in my high school days in the later 90 s  there were a few that look great in them.  true  faith has a way of getting us to a better place than we first realize  sometimes a little reflection is required to discover this.
wokeness ruins everything
who remembers april from the first live action back in 1990  wowza. give me more of that.
my problem with this design is it makes april completely unrecognizable. she looks good for the most part though. and  I do agree with you about the hair  nonetheless.
verse of the day was on point for me. thanks melonie! exactly what I needed to hear.
as a man  all women do look better with long hair to most men  but if they want to have short hair for themselves or because it makes them happy  thats fine  they dont have to prioritize attracting the attention of men.I actually think everybody looks better with at least neck length hair though  but my personal tastes are classical in the sense of the eras when it was very unusual for anybody to have short hair man or woman.
april has been hitting the pizza hard. she has to have the shirt like that to cover the muffin top.
its part of a larger trend to humanize certain characters by slowly moving away from the pinup style of the past. its been a trend for quite a while sadly. you see it pop up once in a while with a  revamp  that often is quite disappointing.

thats just the cartoon incarnation. the mirage books look nothing like the 87 cartoon both have different job professons  the source material aprils an engineer part time apartment tenant  thrift and antique shop owner  that the first movie lifts the reporter part but takes the thift shop scene directly from the comics exile to massachusetts arch

wokeness  tf  is this a dog whistle for bigots and racists
or just bad art and story telling. many need to get out the mainstream world. there are tons of shows out there that focus on adult content  not content made for gen z. check out shows like warrior on hbo max. I usually watch shows rated tv ma. not rated tv 14 and other shows geared to gen z that adults complain about.
wokeness ruined one of my all time favorite series  charmed. the original charmed was on point with female empowerment and showing that the girls could easily keep up and compete with the guys. but the new charmed blatantly had that wokeness message of hardcore 3rd wave feminism where man bad  woman good. meaningless lesbian relationship out the gate to boot. I couldn t last 4 episodes. probably the biggest disappointment Ive ever had in a series.
if youre letting  wokeness  ruin things for you  you didn t have a childhood to ruin in the first place.
everything woke turn to shit.  - a great man.
on a positive note woke shit definitely does give us something to laugh at every day watching these people lose their shit daily is hilarious you cantrigger them with just a couple words
are u sure this is so-called wokeness because from what I am reading this is old real old! based on the back ground this might have been 10 year ago
@lj p
tmnt mirage comics had plenty left leaning politics  lol peter laird and kevin eastman are liberals
@thomas fredrickson  if youre letting  reality  ruin life for you  you didn t have a life to ruin in the first place.
to each their own.demImoore looked very best in gI jane.sigourney weaver looked much better with short hair.girls with pixie cuts look much better
@conscious gentile  you wrong  but youre allowed to be.
@conscious gentile  you are wrong on the internet  we must fight now.
@grobut81
damn  even the 2012 3d animated design of her looks more faithful.
I cant believe we now have to worry about april o neal s haircut xd  le-sigh
I wore short hairstyles  like in my profile pic  for years  but the alphabet crowd totally hijacked it and made me want to grow out my hair for the first time since 4th grade. itsucks that picture of catwoman enthralled me. what run is that from  I want to see more of that  and learn to draw in thatstyle. its absolutely gorgeousI see itsagundam down there in the responses  too xd he s hilarious
yet they ve made casey look like an abercrombie and fitch model.
character named april in an autumn themed outfit....am I crazy for that being my crossed line here
nah mann this is early in the idw comics and here the art style kind of changes every few issues. so character designs change quite a bit between them. she has a couple of looks as the story moves along.  this is like about issue  30ish it was like 2015  I think and all the characters have a bit of rounded pudgy look for a few issues.
april  trying to make a point. I wanted to look more scaggy.  I figured that if you were gay  you d like this style better.  um...  admit it.  youre gay  and you dont like girls.  um...  dont you like this new  butch  less female look   um...  if you dont like my new look  then you must be gay.  okay...  if youre the only choice  then I ll turn gay.  I knew you were gay!
how dare they touch my beloved turtles!! I am beyond pissed!! april has always been part of the  family !! always will be!!
people watch old franchises because they love old characters. april was awesome. even when I was too young to think anything sexual  I liked her and her look. this character is simply not even remotely reminiscent of april. why do these companies keep attaching known names to unkown characters and expecting popularity to just magically transfer
if you wish for april to be hot  look back into the past  take some pictures  and have a few lurkers do a fan-art publication of a tmnt comic.  here s a batch of references https   www.youtube.com watch v dsg3dko5zty t 2193shttps   www.youtube.com watch v tbgz6p4s1jq t 1686shttps   www.youtube.com watch v x1xuao1kxemif you enjoy the classics  mac  then nintendo complete presents whole videos of him beating a given game and offering his thoughts in the description.  these links go to his tmnt tournament fighters series.  the snes one is razorfist s favorite ninja turtles game.  with aska  konamI s original character  by the way  in the roster  who wouldn t think so most of us understand april as a news reporter in the first-generation cartoon  which caught on quite fast.  meanwhile  april in the far-grittier comics is very different  she used to be a lab technician under baxter stockman  who later becomes a fly monster .  she became a martial arts enthusiast at some point  but does befriend the turtles later.konamI s nintendo console adaptations followed the television series  while their only genesis title  perhaps due to muted color palette  follows the comics.  you can see in their approximation of either source  the nes and snes ones are colorful and vibrant.  the sega version catered to the comics  material  where april is not only playable but competent in her own right.this mystified more than a few who only knew the cartoon.  even though its irritating to see the modern comics disregard fashion  remember  the franchise on a whole tends towards colorful  attractive aesthetics  while the non-archie comics  i.e. those that did not adapt the cartoon  retained their initial parodic grittiness.  we cant expect april to always look great.  thatsaid  even in the comics  april held michelangelo s gaze for longer than 0.2 seconds!that does remain in check here  despite everything.  from the overall page above  I believe the artist s style in general makes everybody look off--not just april  everyone! focusing on april alone is missing trees for forest... or vice versa...   maybe they disallow artists from using their better understanding of beauty.  maybe the editors  message lacks truth and justice to begin with.  the platonic or greek sense of beauty cannot shine through here.https   www.youtube.com watch v m2ticd144oethis is loading geek.  dumb  generic name for a channel  right   the videos are the best part.  like  what do you think about when you think of nineties games   geek here plays nothing but arcade fighting games.if that is not laser-focused enough  he almost always selects female characters  whether or not they are good fighters.  actually  the channel s name sticks out in a rather sticky way  come to think of it.  but you know what  his channel is growing super-fast because of this one trick!  its not even a trick!  its the honest-to-God truth!  he might not even speak english as a fourth language  but his instincts know more than most people s facts  sex sells--so does strength.geek released videos of the stateside snes tmnt tournament fighters and its uncensored super famicom version only in japan.  in the 1990s  nintendo of america s censorious localization policies had shot the company in the foot numerous times.  these days  play-station has this issue  all because a japanese company thought it could get away with stateside corporate offices.but  look at geek s videos!  he came out of nowhere  dedicates his venue to letting us watch fantastic beauties beat things to a pulp  and his channel grows.  maximilian dood can learn a trick or two from him.  I bet people know loading geek more than these showrunners who are trying too hard to sell a lauded franchise s latest comics--all because they disregard the importance of beauty.  but not loading geek!speaking of which... when will you make a better-looking alt-channel icon   your expression is unnerving!  and you stick it everywhere!
you have to think the original series had some bondage kink for the amount of time april o neil was tied up in the original series.
always looking forward to these videos your perspective is entertaining and informative
they didn t put weight on april. they changed her body type from hourglass to pear shaped. im not gonna dunk on the pear body type  though it does kinda seem they changed her into a pear because  its seen as a less sexy body type in comparison.
short hair on women can look really good. though I usually think short hair looks better on shorter and slimmer girls. when you take a woman with a larger frame and give her really short hair their head just looks disproportionate to their body. but this is just my personal opinion  I think larger women look better when their hair has a bit of volume to it. most of the time anyway.
God bless you melonie. that Bible verse and interpretation hit home.
this really is the comic industry committing suicide in the slowest  most painful  way possible.
thanks melonie for the awesome video and beautiful Bible verse shared. always enjoy hearing your testimony!
they ve definitely  and obviously intentionally  made her look androgynous.  and I really like short hair styles on women.
the extremes are indeed wrong  but I disagree that catwoman or joanna dark look better with short hair. if they had longer hair then they would have a different look. the short hair gives them an obvious femme fatale look  while if they had long hair I imagine that their look would be closer to a wonder woman style. not better or worse  just a different look.
like I tell my wife  your tattoos are badass. never let anyone tell you differently.

I did like the look of 80s cat women over modern and 60s
this comic was from the northampton arc in idw  from an issue in 2015. this isn t a recent issue. I agree the design is not ideal but this isn t a recent thing  and her hair grows back over the issues.
in the eastman and laird   creators of tmnt   comics april o neil had frizzy black hair and looked nothing like cartoon april
melonie mac  you are a God send in the gaming community. thank you for all you do.
meanwhile  female characters in manga keep looking beautiful and strong while not being insufferable  see you next tuesday. s. manga stop laughing!
meg ryan was always one of my biggest crushes as a wee lad and she always had short hair
great stuff melonie and God bless you we need good people on earth with a good heart  hail !
I love your giant lara croft statue and that collection at the background.
what the hell is even that !
remember when everyone roasted gaara for having thatsame haircut in boruto
Im gonna continue laughing at these demented drug addictsthey need some serious psychological counseling
sounds to me like an argumental ark in thatshreder tries to become an stylist and captures april to practice on her
really good verse and I liked your thoughts on it. this is my current situation  fry from futurama meme  not sure if closed door or if God wants me to persevere through difficulties.
its the social justice haircut!! but for real. when I was 14 I saw this picture of selma blaire with a really short pixie cut and begged my mom to let me cut my hair thatshort. this was back in 2003. I had thatsame haircut a few more times. unfortunately even then  women with short hair still had the stigma of being lesbos and I did get harassed some in highschool because of it.
if they hadn t given the new april the silly haircut  I think she would be even sexier than the original. thats just the body type Im most attracted to. however the original is def. more conventionally beautiful in the way thatshe presents herself. I just dont understand why they feel they have to change something just for the sake of changing it.
april o neail ... g.i. jane 2  cant wait to see it!
look melanie  I think youre wrong on this one. if youre asking subjectively if you personally look better with short hair then thats your opinion  but if youre asking if youre beautiful to the opposite sex you would be in the minority. two different questions with two different answers. some people dont like to hear  but some absolutes do exist most women do look better with long hair. shorthair is considered a more statement-making cut you need a certain personality to fully utilize thatstyle. I love wearing my hair in a mohawk but I realize that I dont pull it off well to the 90  of people who do rock it. doesnt mean I wont rock it but I realized that Im in the minority of thought. an Im all for the brie larson nuke  fast and furious has gone on seven movies too long
really like your tattoos  nice to see someone with fairly cohesive tattoos.
she looks like a real journalist now lol.
ngl  I love the outfit. I think its pretty neat as a casual  comfy look. and I cantotally see april wearing it  actually. very feminine in its own way. but why the less attractive facial features  why the ugly hairdo  Imean  we all know why... but still  why !
hey melonie I just want to say that I grow up with reading the comic books and watching teenage mutant ninja turtles classic cartoon shows and I have seeing a real live movie too back in my childhood days and I thought april o  neil looked great with long red hair in the comic books   on the cartoon show and in live action movie too. anyway I dont know why there is a big issue and problem with woman being with long hair or short hair in a classic cartoon shows or in a comics or in a live action movies too but it depends on how the comic directors wants to draw the pictures of april o  neil in the comic books or how the movie director wants to make them to look like that to play a role in the live movies or how the tv directors want them to look like in cartoons shows  ok melonie. anyway I just want to tell you what I think bout this topic   I do hope you understand and agree with me on this topic too  ok melonie. anyway I hope you have wonderful   great blessed evening at home with your pets   have a good night too  ok melonie.

have you not read any of the mirage comics
the old mirage books april shaved her hair off lol
rofl!!!!!
I prefer old school april.  as in from the mirage run of tmnt.
I love to rock short hair and dont care about labels. I wish other women would feel the same way about their personal style too.
realistic   were talking about a book with talking turtles.
thankfully the new upcoming game didn t butcher her looks
surprised they let her still be a redhead
the best thing about a short haircut thats bad is you can let it grow out. xdsecond best thing is shorter haircut can be covered using wigs  which seems ideal for cosplay or going undercover. xd
the  funniest  thing about this is how the usual activists will beat female characters with the ugly stick on purpose  and tell you the reason is to make them more realistic. for example  alloy. one of the artists said the girl who was used as base for the model looked like she would cry if she broke a nail. because riding dino mechs in a dystopian future is completely realistic.they seem to hate the femme fatale trope a lot  but also keep asking for strong female characters  and always make the women look manly. so this tells me two things  they dont think pretty women can be strong  and they think men are stronger than women. oh  the irony
comic companies   why no one is buying our comics   while manga companies           !!!!!!!
the irony of this is they opted to make april uglier.in the original comics she was a black or mixed woman  you would have thought they would have just reverted her to her original form and called the victory.
thats aiden o neil  but she her goes by april now.
damn looks at bettie page comics at least there is one bastion left. they had even for a moment soiled taarna in her series.
youre looking great in grey. bobs and pixie cuts were cute and different but these days its more of a red flag
when I first saw the panel  I legit thought it was squirrel girl.
6 30 Ive yet to see a female that  according to my personal tastes  doesnt look better without long hair. women dont have to pander to my preferences. but I do think me and a lot of other people would generally agree with the adage that  some women look good with short hair  but all women look better with long hair . that doesnt necessarily mean they must have long hair  or its any sort of obligation to do so.ps  as a relatively atheist person  I can say Ive experienced times where Im clearly being pushed in a certain direction. where the timing of things are just bizarre. I dont believe any one religion is correct - in fact  I believe anyone whom says their religion is undeniably true is talking about things the cannot possibly actually know. I believe this about Christians  jews  muslims  buddhists  and people who collect crystals and cast spells. objectivity ultimately overcomes those religions. specifically  looking at a thing  and understanding that you have no hard evidence to support those beliefs. but I do suspect there s some sort of guiding force out there. I could be wrong though.
what did they do this to april. every time.
april looks the sand in her hour-glass figure has settled in her bottom.
7 40 you know what  I honestly like short hair on women  I like the pixie cut  but Im trying to think of a woman who has short hair and if it was longer it would look worse... and Im drawing a blank.the best I can say is short and long are equally good when pulled off right  but it takes a lot more to pull off a short haircut than a long one.
what   no!  I grew up in the 80s and everyone knows april o neil rocks a yellow jumpsuit and much better hair.
only a sith deals in absolutes
you mean  arpil o neil  if anyone had any doubts about how bad their editors are they missed that during the print
it helps that dotemu isn t in america or the uk so they dont exactly got any woke checkboxes to follow.  at least  for now.
yeah they actually respect the ip they are working on like sor4
and white.
and a woman.
give it a few months and she will be black and a man  but might still have red hair though.

what on earth does it mean to be a  relatively atheist person   its not a question of degree. either you are or you aren t.
@thagomizer  I believe there s probably something responsible for creating everything. but I dont care what it is  and to spend too much time analyzing what it would be is a waste of time. there s also not a single religion on this planet thats correct. if it wanted to and or was capable of revealing itself  it would do so.
you are correct about the hair stuff  but what type youre describing yourself as is agnostic  not atheist.
@heazie  I simplify to atheist because if I tell most people  Im a mostly agnostic deist  their eyes glaze over.
@tuxedo blackfoot  oh  so you lie.   gotcha.
80s april best april!
april in mirage never rocked a yellow jumpsuitshe wore blue coveralls in issue two and wore regular casual clothes
the tmnt comics and the tmnt cartoon from the 80s were two completely different stories.so to me  my fav april o neil is the classic 80s cartoon version that I grew up with.perhaps one of my first waifu before I knew what a waifu was.
Im curious about your opinion on video games in heaven. do you think we ll have them  do you want them   Ive been pondering the idea for a little bit lol
because they made one of the hottest girls in hollywood april in the movies so in revenge they made her ugly.... also the  message
mma fighter rose namajunas rocks the short hair and looks incredible. also agree that to many labels are used to try to put people in categories. labels are meant for clothes not people.
they want people in comics to look like them or their spouses.
there s a video by a comedian named ryan long where he does a skitshowing how much the far left and far right have in common. you should check it out. Ive long thought this about both sides   Im pretty center as well  but I have friends who lean more left who cant or wont see this.
when do we get a room tour of the lara croft statues
thats not april  thats squirrel girl
bayonetta has rocked the long and short hair look as has jeanneI willl always prefer short bayo and jeanne no matter what though
there is an obsession these days with making everything ugly. ugly on the outside and inside.
melanie  twitter really just makes the extreme minorities louder. there s a lot of gray out there where most people land. you dont need to explain your totally normal thought process to anybody.
april has the same hair stylist as tintin.   aside from that   I dont like the art style in general from that comic.
I dont know who that is but that ain t april. looks more like squirrel girl.
so when are they gonna draw casey as bald with a fat body type and april being attracted to his appearance
gonna have to agree with that guy.  some women look good in short hair  but all women look better with long.  at least those who s hair hasn t fallen out.
I love that Bible segment in this video - its a huge comfort to know that  when one path you pursue doesnt work out  it may often be that the path youre on right now  or are being led towards  is better. sure  it calls for discernment and wisdom  but you nailed it when you said that we ll look back in ten twenty years from now and think to ourselves  Im glad that door was closed at the time . keep going boom with your Bible segments. you rock!
she looks like she works writes draws for current marvel .
you should cover the sam maggs naming rivet nonsense
feel like the arguments on that post introduced melonie to that truth of the mirror between the extreme-left   extreme-right
its not even a hair cut  its just her head. she painted hair lines on her bald head.
but still april from the mirage source material is nothing alike like the 87 cartoon
ugh judith hoag and page turnco were average and the cartoon doesnt represent april have you not picked up a mirage comic book
love rose  but everytime I see her she reminds me of sid from toy story lol.

apparently  every woman needs to be hard to distinguish from men  this seems to be the predominant thing to do in comics. I dont understand why as one of the greatest qualities of females in my opinion is their beauty. maybe Im just old though.
what is it about melonie that just makes ya smile
who else thinks new april looks like fledge from skyward sword
please continue to stand up for nuance. thanks.
but why are our comics not selling !
isn t saying the character at 9 27  wouldn t look as good with long hair  kinda the same as saying  all women look better with long hair   Imean  both points are presented as statements of facts but clearly  can  only reflect personal preference. I see little difference  honestly.
I pray for you every day meloniemac. jeremiah 29 11. I love that youre not afraid to share Jesus with everyone. I always look forward to your videos.
love the book of isaiah. it also has my favorite verses isaiah 55  8-9
april looks like she s about to lecture me on her pronouns.
love your point about being anti-extremist which is where I stand.lately with all the woke stuff happening  I started to feel my dialog was too conservative but that ain t it.this mentality of us against them  pushing messages  and to see politics in everything is not healthy.
I will admit  not a fan of tattoos  but its preference. thatsaid  many women rock their tattoos. its just not my preference.
its not just the hair  they ve changed her body type too. she s now pear shaped with chubby thighs... so its the hair   body that changed... ugh... I ll take the last ronin april with the cybernetic body parts over this any day.
I love when a woman can pull off short hair  but unfortunately its not something everyone can do.
also...the short hair of the 90 s was hot! God  if I saw a girl with an undercut hairstyle I was on it! the new short haircuts are definitely a sign for men to stay away..lol
back in the day  media created and influenced style. seems like now they re trying to trace over a style that already exists in a very dull and overrepresented segment of youth culture. there was no girl in the real world that looked or dressed like april o neil which is what made her unique and iconic. even the live action tmnt movies understood this and made the characters extremely stylized and exaggerated .
Im definitely leaning middle politically  perhaps more slightly right just because I cant stand the extreme leftist mentality. but I also cant stand some of the extremist behavior of the right either. basically I dont like extremists and remember that only a sith deals in absolutes  haha.
april looking like she goes by xir here
to be fair  the stigma with short haired woman being lesbian existed for decades. its just now the stigma is being enforced.
this isn t my april... why would they even do this bruh...
her bright personality. its also rare to see pretty women in gaming culture that actually have morals and values and aren t completely insane leftists. its like finding a beautiful woman in this day and age that you can actually have an intelligent conversation with except she is doing all the talking. rare.

the original april was my first comics crush. this version is not good at all. I personally dont mind a short  choppy haircut on girls but this looks awful. I noticed like you said that they added a few more pounds to her. not necessarily a bad thing but the original april was a perfectly healthy weight. those are nice curves but they put a baggy shirt on her to even cover those. we dont live in a world of absolutes so thinking that only one of two options is correct just stifles personal opinions and uniqueness.finally   selling pictures of your butthole  line made me laugh so hard my neighbor heard me.
imagine someone being offended by a person saying  lara croft should always be a loner  just because they themself canthink of storylines where her working with others would work great. imagine them saying that to have that opinion is to be guilty of the other extreme of some woke-style ideology and thereby to say it is to be no better than  woke. the non woke have opinions. the woke force opinions. gigantic difference.
they gave april the elliot page boy s hair cut.
I personally like girls with short hair  but this april looks absolutely awful. what makes it even worse is the cringe-worthy dialogue of all the other characters telling her how amazing she looks.
they gave her the body of a 50 year old mom.
I have a personal preference of a woman with at least chin-length hair. ps. on the extreme ends of the political spectrum actually having similar ideas but expressed differently  welcome to horseshoe theory political spectrum.
I gotta disagree. almost all women do look better with long hair  even those select few who can rock itshort. of course  thats a personal taste and I wouldn t ever tell someone they cant or shouldn t do their own hair how they want it. if you like how you look  thats what matters.
she looks slightly more pear shaped in her figure now too. I dont know  maybe its the hair making me see that.
if freedom truly is a thing in the us  then there should be more harmony  I would say.
I agree with the lady that hot girls can look good in short hair  but all girls look better in long hair.   short being shorter than shoulder length.
the left has moved so far left that centerists are no longer in the middle. we are now more half way between center and far right.
the tmnt live action movie from the 90s had a way more attractive april than this new one
insert  look how they massacred my boy meme
beauty isn t allowed.we must all be equalized whether we like it or not.there must be no distinction.
darth vader voice   noooooooooo!
lol....while I dont think your volume of tats makes you less ladylike per se  whatever that means in this context   I do think they are an.....odd  life choice. if I had to guess  while you seem reasonably libertarian  conservative socially currently  I imagine you were somewhat less so when you tatted up....just sayin
conventionally attractive    attractiveno need to add the  conventionally  part.  attractive is attractive.  its universal  whether some folks like it or not.
she got herself a buzz cut but kept the bangs
I prefer the 80 s april.   she s iconic.   this is just a mockery
its ok to go on a lgbt gay pride day march half naked wearing nothing but a speedo and glitter but when a woman does it in a comic or video game suddenly thats  the male gaze  or whatever they dress her in male armor or make her chubby  cut her hair short and so on.

this is but one artist interpretation of the tmnt  and thats mirage alumnI ross campbell  aka sophie campbell who been around since the vol. 4 run  of the original mirage continuity and was on board for the nick viacom idw buy out transition that drawn the leonardo micro series and brought over concepts from the canceled dark horse comics tmnt reboot and her secret of the ooze fan fiction recolored o.c. jennika based off artemesia
Im always amused when I hear an argument about superheroine costumes that is  no woman would dress like that!  and here I am  a cosplayer who works on a college campus and I see women dressed in the most revealing  skin tight costumes at conventions  even when they should not scare people with their  curves   and see the female college students in tights and the athletes jogging in practically underwear.
@robin thrush  most gym   athletic wear based on different types of undergarment wear if you and really look at them. also why do you think most modern gyms are a places of peacocking without forms of inebriation and the modern workout apparel keeps getting tighter
not so much worried about april s look.... but the quality of the art has completely gone down. look at the turtles in the background  it looks like 6 year olds did the drawing...
most females look better with long hair because very few can pull it off. you proved it by saying you need a sharp bone structure. I think that is what is being said.
audrey hepburn has gorgeous short hair.
hI I just subscribed to your channel. Im a gamer and youtuber. Im a Christian as well. as a tmnt fan I think this iteration of april o neill is horrendous. why take away the femininity and beauty april had in the previous comics  itseems to me that these artist are bitter and jealous of these fictional characters so they purposely make these characters ugly to make themselves feel good about themselves
did april get a breast reduction also
Imiss the days when you could have feminine women and bombshells in games and media without it causing an absolute crap storm. since when has women being actually feminine and attractive wrong
and of course she s no longer a redhead.
catwoman fan here. its not about the hair being short. I get it. its about completely changing april  the way they completely change my favorite character and many other people s favorite character. its about a culture war. its about thought police. its about brainwashing the next generation.  they are correct thinking our favorite characters. have you notice its all 80s and 90s stuff that is being edited  they know this was an influential time on youth culture. it would make sense to destroy the 80s and 90s stuff  if you want global domination in the future. they are not completely erasing it though. they are just correcting it and replacing it.  dont be surprised when they completely get rid of the original ideas of april  catwoman and lara croft in the future. the future generations will have nothing to compare too  if there is no one alive who remembers it.  but I dont think it is entirely hopeless. the future generations may also just come up with their own thing. kids will come up with their own stuff  if they cant find what they like anywhere else. talented artist can create their own underground art. catwoman  april and lara croft are all just ideas. we give them life as long as we remember them. that isn t going to stop someone from creating images of them. look at all the people who mod games for free. people are smart and they will find a way.
I agree with most of what you say but some alcohol can have major health benifits obviously if you dont abuse it though.
10 40its called horseshoe theory where  at their extremes  things are more alike than different...kind of like a horseshoe. also  other than deity  what is the difference between islam and the left in terms of how they go about their chosen faith ie. thinking the government is God and that the agenda should be worshiped
the extreme left and extreme right complaining about the same thing.my old pastor used to call that the same business on the other side of the street.
that looks like a 10-year-old boy s head on a mom s body...
12 59 I dont understand how someone can be  libertarian  but still stigmatize sex work and sex workers at the same time. if you dont think its healthy then dont do it.
I bet when people start getting mad they will say she has alopecia.
preach melanie! short hair can look cool too and tattoos are awesome! but yes they completely ruined april. Im a gay dude and growing up with the old ninja turtles cartoons she had that awesome jumpsuit and a cool and cute style! what is with wokies and making everyone bland and uglier.
Im amazed again and again at how the supposed  allies  are constantly the most homophobic people in the room.  every time they see two men together its   oh  you guys are  good friends    seems kinda gay! or if a man is crying or upset  like at a movie or hearing a sad song  its  hey look at this guy crying like a girl -- sure he s not queer  or  see that woman in a frumpy shirt and short haircut   I bet she s a d  e! and Im like  damn do you guys not hear what you are saying    because I heard what you just said  and holy s  t!  we dont talk like that anymore!  at least we re not supposed to.  that kind of attitude went out of style in the 1960s!!why do you sound like the villain from a 1980s teen comedy
this april o neil has b.o.
first they made her younger in the cartoons because nick didn t like the idea of an adult woman associating with teenage males  now they re doing this.
worst looking  april  o neal ever
as catholic  today s verse is often a reference for the primacy of peter  from whom Jesus said   thou art peter  and upon this rock I will build my church  and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. and I will give to thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven. and whatsoever thou shalt bind upon earth  itshall be bound also in heaven  and whatsoever thou shalt loose upon earth  itshall be loosed also in heaven.   matt 16  18 - 19   of course the verse you bring up today can be read as a metaphor for life  as interpretation of the verses can have many layers. but there is an importance about the keys and the ability of those that God chooses for specific purposes in salvation history as well. st. peter s primacy by no means makes him perfect. for not much longer after the praise given to peter for recognizing Jesus as the Christ does Jesus then rebuke peter  saying   go behind me  satan  thou art a scandal unto me  because thou savourest not the things that are of God  but the things that are of men.   matt. 16  23 this was because peter was rebuking Jesus  who was speaking the prophecy of his own death. now  its only natural that peter would want to protect our Lord  and that was the point of Jesus  rebuke  was that peter was thinking merely of the flesh  and had not yet come to realize our Lord s death as it pertains to salvation history.  there have been even a few popes that were not fond of the crucifix and believed that Christians ought to focus on our Lord s life and resurrection. in a sense  that kind of gets back to what a lot of your videos are about. its that  often the right and the left aren t all that different in some deep  core elements  but differ in how they respond to them. after all  the concept of national parks wasn t conceived by a liberal tree hugger  but rather by a republican president - theodore roosevelt. the idea that a powerful central bank was a bad thing was pushed by a democrat president  andrew jackson  who also is one of few  if not the only president in us history to pay down the national debt. but we often have a hard time seeing those aspect in our own natural history. the comic reboots and movie remakes of past favorite stories and characters of our fiction also get lost in the modern depictions. if we as humans have this much trouble keeping the our non-fiction and fictional stories straight  how much so do we have trouble with the supernatural salvation history in the Bible   so yes  Jesus praises peter when he answers and responds through the revelation of the spirit  but rebukes the same peter when he reacts in the fears and misunderstanding of the flesh. we too have to keep these things in mind in our own interpretations. for if even the apostles could be misled  or misunderstand something with Jesus right there to teach them  then we must take care that we also are discerning whether our interpretation follows the holy spirit  or if we are trying to accommodate for our more fleshly natural desire for the way we think something ought to be. it certainly isn t easy. even the apostle we catholics claim as the first pope  as well as the hundreds of men thatsucceeded him as pope  including a time when we had the french and roman popes that were fighting over who was the true successor  or even today with some believing pope emeritus benedixt xvI is the true pope  and claiming pope francis the imposter - in all this  we see from the time of the apostles and to this day something of a manifestation of peter as both being a strong rock and cornerstone of the faith  but also being prone to folly  to making mistakes. I wont get into papal infallibility here. thats its own sort of pandora s box of a conversation to be had. the point is more or less how we can observe these aspects of what it means to be  in the spirit  as opposed to  in the flesh .  our human culture has this sense of both the spirit of things  as opposed just doing what we want  be it the spirit or letter of the law  or trying to write for an author or comic book creator in the spirit of the story they want rather than just doing whatever you feel is right. I suppose you can say its like context over just a mere text. sure  we have to learn the letters in order to read and write. but once we grasp that  we have to read into the story and try to connect things in order to find the context and meaning behind the story.

I literally said people should do what they want  even though I dont see it as a healthy thing. not sure how you missed my point Imade quite clearly lol
@melonie mac go boom  yeah  you said people can do what they want but then shamed for it by comparing sex work to alcohol  which I dont think is a fair comparison .
melonie is accurate in the video
who s we  most people find this stuff insane
we are so far past the point of inclusion and into full on heterophobia as far as everything coming out of hollywood. I fear for the next generation who are growing up on this. one individual thing is not enough to have this said  but the absolute onslaught of things like this are conversion therapy
I dont mind tattoos but I think they need to be earned to some degree.
its also the result of hiring unqualified people. rather than hiring people with beautiful arts  just hire someone fitting the diversity quota  p
when did this comic come out  because what I am hearing is this is an old comic and not something that just came out
there is a reason cosplayers still dress as original april  the original toys still sell  the original artwork and cartoons. this was everyone s april o neil that both men and women enjoyed not the feminist post apocalyptic lgbtq version
at this point  I wonder if even woke people are tired of wokeness lol
the cartoon was a step up
ha  I didn t know a haircut could also change one s hip size...go figure..
well mel you might wanna go back and look at the original run of comics she looked like gene simmons
looks kinda like me when angry. like the girl with dragon tattoo.
when skating on thin ice  might as well tap dance. we cant become what we need to be by remaining what we are.
I cant believe my comment got melonie to say butth les multiple times in a video lol. she s awesome.

look up the music video invincible by pat benatar. that woman rocked short hair in the 80 s
april o no!!!
she would have looked better with the guys haircut xd
not like everyone else is not ugly... including turtles
they made her frumpy!  a news personality  thats frumpy and just plain   not even close to reality.  no matter the person s size  they try to look their best  not worst!
all girls do look better with long hair .. lol . its an objective fact . they ve done studies .. that doesnt mean anyones pushing anything on anyone
tnmt was my childhood heroes. looking how almost every version after is straying further and further from the source material is breaking my heart and I refuse to watch or read em. especialy april in the last decade. and while this video shows alot of focus on april  is noone gonna mention the turtles look in that page.... Imean... lol!
this version has been running since 2011 and this panel is from I wanna say 2014 or 2015.
they are  they just refuse to admit it

seth rogen will do worse to april in his tmnt movie
oh no! they gave april a new haircut   so awful  .no seriously girl what are you doing
they are trying to bring  more reality  to a comic about four walking talking turtles and a walking talking rat.   nuff said....
you know what s really nice looking   a feminine woman is a dress  that also sports a few tattoos. if she has a feminine demeanor.
that is the hair cut the stylist puts on you when they fucked up!
to be fair that yellow suit did not do anything good for her.
yikes! not my april
why did they have to give her a hair cut that looks like it belongs to a ten year old male  thats just unsettling.also  that girl who said  all women look better with long hair  needs to just admit that thats her preference.
melonie I recommend you to check out this epic marvel comic book called punisher kills the whole entire marvel universe . its a good comic I enjoy the punisher comics even punisher goes in dc hunt down the joker such a gem  !
politics aside - some hair styles work some dont  reason being is it takes a figure to even out the look and frumpy doesnt do it ..... they widened her waist gave her post birth hips and overly globbed thighs kankles and a really wide shoulder with ..... I cant make excuses for it they literally took an impossible mix of bad things and added it in all at once and topped it with an extreme chest reduction ... its bad real bad
april shaved her head in  vol4 of the source material  of the mirage comics so how is it woke
its almost as if they hate beautiful confident woman characters. from what Ive seen this seems to be a trend. this look  in my opinion  just looks sloppy and androgynous. pitiful!
that haircut does not work for april
dont self-insert when youre ugly  as a general rule.
that was a self insert.
itshould be a crime to make my girl april ugly.
short hair marie fredrickssen from roxette  anyone I am not a fan of tattoos.  I dont understand them  but thats a personal choice.  given your love of lara croft  I can see why you have the tattoo you have.   -
she looks like a random persona npc
I do think longer hair on women is inherently more feminine.that is not to say that all women should have long hair  nor am I saying short hair cant be feminine. it can and often is. but throughout all of history  long hair has been considered to be more feminine than short hair.I think you were making a much bigger issue out of that comment than was necessary. no disrespect. just my thoughts.
that woman was right about long hair.
its sophie campbell s art style

idw now stands for...
girls with tattoos are sexy. it is like you get to read a comic or go to a gallery whilst getting down to business.
raphael gonna rage
why does she have the room of a 15 year old
the funny part is go look up the original april o niel  from the black and white comics . she has long frizzy hair. almost mixed race looking.
I would never say they re making april uglier  not that you meant to dis april in the title or anything . the real april o neil was never ever in any way ugly. they re trying to make this new fake april o neil into a bland  boring beta so they dont feel threatened by her. heaven forbid someone actually looks really pretty!
she looks like tintin.
next they re going to make scarlett and the baroness overweight
you need that haircut to get into the cult.
from megan fox to this huh   sigh  at least the side of her head isn t shaved.
is this the idw run  I really dont like the change in artwork! Im only 40 issues in on the run with the omnibus but the arts been pretty good but this is not good! I hope the story is still good. I dont mind them giving her short hair and a new style but make the art look good. even casey and the turtles dont look good. thats my opinion. others might like this art but I dont!
yeah same both sides are just too crazy. I am happy with being in neither.
they want all characters to be androgenous .. its either infinite genders  or no genders.
yellow jumper suit april is best april
they re making april butch and dressing her in horrible clothes smh.  this is the epitome of woke and  everything woke turns to   smh.  welcome to idiocracy smh also let s go brandon fjb fjt.
joanne dark looks okay  but normally I do not like short hair on girls at all.  from an attractiveness angle that is  not a political one
nothing good has ever came from wokeness!
the discussion about the girl s reply wasn t even worth the response. say that you disagree and move on.
if I remember right she was supposed to be a black woman. that is the irony of them doing this  if they were smart they would have just reverted her to her original look and took the victory.
@dying rose  part of  the great reset.
I always liked women with short hair  if it works.  but this doesnt.  with the body they ve drawn it makes her look soccer mom rather than april o neil.
long hair or short hair woman s are beautiful !!
doesnt even look like april.  just some random girl
all men look better with a mustache.
the turtles dont look much better.
tbf natalie portman shaved her head for v for vendetta and then went straight back to long hair
but the 90s was the best decade  people are not allowed to be beautiful  because ugly people need to be represented  but there are beautiful people also  so now we are not representing them  wtf. Im staying in 90s and 00s screw the new stuff. I ll wait until wokeness is over with.
that ain t april
short hair just reminds me of a line out of screwtape letters regarding the jazz age and confused sexualities due to making women look like boys. definitely prefer long hair on women.
inb4 they make donatello gay
tattoos are beautiful
this is supposed to be the woman that all four turtles  including shallow  tv obsessed mikey  fall head over heels for  no. I came from the far left all the way to libertarian center  right around where youre at  dont change  ya perfect!
april has the same hair cut as ash s rival from pokemon sun and moon the anime  women can look good with short hair but that hair cut is to make her look boyish. it makes no sense.
Im sure someone has already said it but she looks like a pumpkin.
I wonder this change in her look got anything to do with megan fox being the hottest april o neil ever....
even the turtles look lame in this comic....
they just dont look like characters I would care about.
notmyapril
I always liked short hair on girls found lots of but it has to be done just right  these guys are just trying to ruin another fandom and apele to the wokees
come on. you know why
mm. shamir. crush.
Im aware. still think she looked better with short hair
ok  yeah she looks fine either way.
if
some of God s greatest gifts are unanswered prayers ...........
when did the toxic avenger join tmnt  oh wait  thats april o neil  I guess when they aren t replacing gingers  they re making  em fugly.
that is not april o neil. thats so far gone from the original look that they might as well make a whole new character. doesnt look like most news anchor women.
nana osakI is an actual waifu and nana komatsu is trash  true
glad that I dropped tmnt around 100  its when they it focused too much on jennika  who they turned into a turtle and focused way too much on her and her gf. april can rock short or long hair but this hairstyle is ugly.
wow they completely trashed april this is what happens when you give a woke artist freedom
what was wrong with her in the old shows .nothing.
ok now Im mad
karen o neil
short hair aside... she should ve drop by the gym too...
she looks ridiculous lol
only sith deal in absolutes
natalie portman looks bad with short hair. looks like the little twin boys from the suite life with zack and cody
was this because the last night when epic rap battle said that I was the fourth ninja turtle
commenting to feed the algorithm
good grief what have they done to beautiful and gorgeous april o neal !     did they take her to a back alley surgeon for a bootleg bbl and a facelift and cut for  300 bucks and coke
dude  what did they do to april s nose !!! it looks like a clam. she always had a sharp  small nose. anti-nose job   botox nose  wtf
would fox news or cnn hire her  no
yeah  that dont look like april o neil. . . .and that dont look like casey jones - where s his hockey mask!
trust in him...........also  you wanna make God laugh............make a plan.......
beat me to it!
are you absolutely sure
I think she looks best with a bob cut  though she s beautiful enough for the shorter one mel posted  I agree thats not her at her most attractive  at least imo.
@the number 3  yup. I agree
msnbc would.
that natalie portman short haircut is too short though. looks like a teenage boy.
I think Im gonna be sick
they are trying to erase women
thin but still curvy    attractive. she lucks awful now. ruined so many daydreams.
to be fair  for the past few years none of the humans have looked attractive in the comics. the story is really good though.
Im just surprised she s still straight. unless they are now saying lesbians kiss men.
sorry  but youre friend s comment is correct.
hImelonie!
if God interfiers then is it really free will
al this woke sh.. will eventually come back as a boomerang  people will get fed up with it because they are never satisfied and people dont like to be forced into some one else s opinion s
the girl is correct just like all men look better in a suit  all women look better with long hair.
the hotness
cool
same reason why I refuse to buy the new horizon game
hImelonie can you rank every tomb raider game
love your beautiful female self
Imean she doesnt look that bad  everything is fine except for her head  her haircut is shit and she looks like a king of the hill character. casey jones on the other hand  look how they massacred my boy.
some guys look good with long hair  but all guys look better with short hair. Imean  this is the flip of that female long hair statement and  to be fair  not wrong. hell  some guys look better with no hair. isn t a controversial statement.
yet casey jones is still broad and hunky ... eh ...
the comics made april o neil uglier so she would more accurately reflect what modern urinalists look like
ugh mirage source material april doesnt look  alike like the 87 cartoon april
there is only tr legends... none other... xd
@micah price  there are 28 unique tomb raider games out there including the ps1 era expansion on pc
I expect the core era games to top that list
thats easy for mel. she will rank the originals top  followed by underworld and legend. basically  tr gets progressively worse and worse. kinda like ac.
just look at halle barry she had short hair during her hay day and she s still fine.
because being plain and frumpy is everyone s power fantasy.  right
leave the og april alone  you wokies! jeez..... well  go woke  go broke I guess.
skinny and curves  she wore a yellow jump suit. no boy in the 80 s fancied april. they were too busy spaffing over she-ra. this picture is a step up from black april o neil.
its fine to have an opinion. your opinion is wrong because it does not fall in lime with mine. lol no other opinions accepted lol
bootleg chie
whyyyyy
they might as well of just shaved the side of the head. nothing id sacred anymore
I saw the thmbnail... I really  really dont care for that look for april. imagine if dc did something similar to power girl  poison ivy or catwoman  no thank you.
also another thing why does the turtles look like gumdrops ik april is the discussion but the turtles look horrible in this comic but yea every woman and hairstyle can be sexy and feminine if the woman wearing it wants it to be
the woke are so over there head. women look amazing with pixe haircuts.
I know that we have to make women less attractive because of the male gaze but the question needs to be asked do lesbians not like hot women
mh-hm  she looks less attractive. but you  girl  damn  youre rockin!
Im the same way.I am againsts authoritarian behaviour.nowadays Im anti-woke because the woke are the ones controlling  cancel culture  and have the most media control. most conservatives Imeet are more open to freedom of speech than wokes are...however  the second that trad conservatives look like they are gaining more power and pushing against our freedoms  Im flipping sides. they were more akin to this back in the 80s-90s. I lived through the religious rights karen-esque bullshit. I fought against it. now its the woke that are behaving the same way.I am anti-authoritarian and pro freedom.an actual liberal  not a disgusting woke commie.the black pill here is this   to keep all of our freedoms  we will always be running in place  watching that pendulum swing. it is what it is.... we must not allow our culture to stagnate or to progress of a cliff.
dude...
that is not april o neil. that is a trans with short hair.
unfappril ogleil
im into short haired girls  and not even I like this shit...
everyone puts people in boxes... we like to define things... except what a woman is... thats the big unknown apparently.
holy cow...haircut and pear shaped now... yikes! the sloppy outfit doesnt help either... im so tired of them de-feminizing women and making men look like idiots and weak. and if they do change a female character to be stronger  than everyone ...they overdo it and make them have a mans body. im saying this as a person that loves abs and muscle on women...there s definitely a point where it looks like a mans body. lol
salut    faulkkk  !!!!j aI refait le g n rique des tortues ninja en live !!!! tiens cadeau !!!https   youtu.be szm7sdpnhvs
that ain t april its squirrel girl.
where s me chuck bag  I hate that dead-rat haircut look.
maybe the idea thatshe looks  ugly  is that the artist cant draw for shit. this whole book is kind of unimpressive.
hard pass on the short hair in general. looking like 10 yr old boys
sjws have ruined hair dye too
venus has lost her arms and legs  her face is completely stitched up and somehow april is even uglier than all that with just a simple haircut. damn.
the turtles   splinter fought antI sjw far right conservative doomsday preping malitias in the early mirage comics and it was adapted into the 2003 show.
not only does april look worse  but that artwork is just ugly in its entirety.  Im not an artist  but dang what happened to talent in comics   in the most recent cartoon  they also race swapped her.
april and casey look awful.
why did they make her look like a homeless lesbian
reject modernism  embrace cowabogaism
almost universally women look better with long hair youre in denial
I prefer long hair at all times but I wouldn t proclaim that its  objectively better but that april. thats just bad.
wtf did they do to my girl april ! that is not a woman s haircut! that is an androgynous haircut! horrible haircut! I am not attracted to this version of april at all and they did this to make her be not nearly as attractive as she was originally because they hate feminine looking girls! getting sick of these already established female characters getting turned into androgynous characters!
where has the  art  in  artist  gone  those new comics look like a 12yo has drawn them. actually no. there is a whole lot of 12yos that are better at drawing than that
been collecting comics for 30 years and when I see s    like that in comic books I cut my collection immediately. its not the haircut its the pathetic conformity to wokeness in the whole design.
I hate short hair on women. yuck  I didn t even like halle berry when she had short hair for awhile.  no bueno
idk  maybe the penciler doesnt do humans well  casey doesnt look that attractive either
she looks like squirl girl
melonie you make very good points on this video. I really think that every extremes  right or left are pretty much the same thing  both are very moralists and think they are truth owners. I refuse to being in one extreme or another. but about your comment on adult content creators  it is a work  a job. people in general in any kind of job do the job for the money  not because they necessarily love what they are doing  but because when they weight the good and the bad they think that is worth to do the work. I think that is pretty much puritanism treat adult content in a different way in comparison to others jobs that people do for money. and yes  many people love to do adult content because it is freedom in many ways and pays the bills  and pays much better when the people make success than many others jobs.
that art was so terrible everything on that page looked ugly...
ugh if you collected tmnt from the mirage continuity to the idw continuity you would recognize that  thats transgender ross campbell aka sophie campbell art style and she s been a mirage veteran alumnI for quite some time since mirage vol 4. was still churning out issues with peter laird putting out his liberal politics in the book ranting about the bush administration and segways being the future she created a story about raphael fighting abunch of vampires  in the mirage books she s been around pitching concept art for the canceled pitch of the dark horse comics tmnt reboot  to peter laird selling the rights over to nickelodeon viacom and currently works with tom waltz   kevin eastman who helped bring in the mutanimal mutagen gimmick that you 87 cartoon stans love she gave you the  fan favorite female recolor o.c. insert  jennika from her secret of the ooze fan fiction character artemesia  the ninjara ripoff alopex  and revitilzing venus demilo. this not the first time april shaved her hair she did it  in vol.4 after she was revealed to be a living cartoon of the magic crystal that brought jack kirbys drawings to life and went down the path of taking on the costume  vigilante mantle of nobody.
is her whole head shaved but her bangs
show me you cant draw hair
Jesus  that is the worst uglification I have seen woke warriors do  that face looks horrible but I do give some credits for that leaf shirt  it looks nice.
nah  the artist currently on the book is just awful
trashcomics
nobody gonna mention the fact that the turtles look like shit
I am really really really starting to dislike these leftist
she looks so frumpy  terrible   wtf did they do to the turtles design! ! maybe they would look better if drawn by a more talented artist
these people they hire just cant draw very good there not hired for there skills there hired for who they now or what boxes they can check on diversity for the company
what happened to america
well I guess its better than the race swapped april from the tv show
the turtles look hideous.
this is why I dont do fake geek girls hahahhaa jk do your research
it looks melonie has a script that automatically removes comments with links in them  I previously posted a comment on the nature of that chapter of isaiah. it got removed right away. I think because I had a link a Bible concordance about it.
even the turtle visuals are bland and ugly
well  looks like Im 1st. so its my turn to say something   post some comments for once
wai
we are practically watching to see how much they are obsessed with uglifying female characters.
they re not hired for their skills they re hired for who they know
@dying rose  well at least some are thinking or have thought process not fueled by fantasy. you guys are living in ever growing toxic environment but see everything as ok  well majority ignore the ongoing.
eww. even the old eastman and laird books weren t this bad. gigan.
yeah  that look is kind of an insult to short-haired women. that and the artstyle is kinda garbage  which really doesnt help matters. give me sun shangxiang  pronounced soon shang shee-ahng  from dynasty warriors any day over whatever that hideous design is.
I corinthians 11  14-1514 does not the very nature of things teach you that if a man has long hair  it is a disgrace to him  15 but that if a woman has long hair  it is her glory  for long hair is given to her as a covering.
is she trans and or gay now
ewwww!!! this is disgustingly insulting! the west really have this move attack on female beauty. thats why Im going the anime route in which the females still look beautiful. see... marin kitagawa!
that is not april o neil thats some random chick with short hair the charc looks fine its just not april she looks more like that black woman from the wonder woman comics the one with the homeland security that helps wonderwoman.and yes some woman look better with short hair I prefur the ones that look better with long hair.when you talk about the industry its just stupid from 1 side woman cant look to good in comics yet from the other side all the hot woman have to often do sexual favors for roles how hypocritical is that.I think the Bible verse refurs to that you get the key to all the wonders and cool things of the spirit its open to everyone non shal shut  but the sheep like people wil be shut of to this that what refurs to   non shall open .that is a way to interpret it Bible verse are usualy metafors and  he shall shut and non shall open  might refur to the knowledge if spirit beeing shut of to those who are sheep.Gods path is open to everyone but not everyone is open to it.
that isn t april  I ll never accept that as april.  idw needs to lose the license asap.... after last ronin  5
blah. no thanks
to be fair  its not just april that looks bad. just looking at the one panel you showed. all the art style for this looks lousy to me.
woke carp destroys everything great and good
the art just looks gross to me. why would anyone even read a comic with that generic looking crap artwork
she doesnt look ugly tho
