before a years worth of wokeness   shurI should take up the mantle after a years worth of wokeness   uhhhhhh
my biggest issue with the choice not to recast is the fact that the character t challa is a pretty big Goddamn deal in marvel. he has a long  storeyed history in comics and a pretty cool rogues gallery in the same vein as captain america  iron man  batman  superman and spider-man. if these properties can have fully realised multi-film arcs and superhero  careers  why shouldn t t challa   rumours are thunderbolt ross will be recast soon.
ngl Im excited and also saddened to see her step into the role as the new bp. she became bp in the comics but its sad for obvious reasons. I want her to make me proud and I have her back. I am a bit worried that they ll try to make things woke. I honestly see that happening with iron heart thoupdate  Im gonna fence sit like josh normally does
people want to bring up shurI in the comics became black panther but not talking about how t challa was still alive at that time and in the comic  shurI was a warrior in the mcu she is just smart and creates weapons and outfits
with all their previous shenanigans of swapping male characters by female characters  marvel has lost the benefit of the doubt people would normally give them. and there s a good reason for that  all the replacement characters are s  . ergo  the fans will assume that female black panther will probably be s   as well.
if it was simply one of the women in t challa s family taking over as bp  particularly shurI  I wouldn t have thought much of it. unfortunately this is  current year   so I have little hope this would be done well.
this would be a good opportunity to give shuris character some development.  in most of the films so far she s been very headstrong and confident. having lost her brother to disease  even with all of her technical ability  she could be having a severe crisis of identity and grief.  this would give a chance for her to mature some more and give the mcu some much-needed depth since they ve gone all in on goofiness lately. it would also go a long way to endearing her to the audience since its something many of us have had to deal with.do I think they ll actually do any of that no I think this movie will probably just be meh
my main issues with the  too soon  argument is that feige said was too soon to recast him  despite the family wanting that  but it wasn t too soon to replace his character entirely  after killing him off off screen  and procede with the movie even after his death  and people who use this sound more so like their saying  feige knows better than his family  . yes her becoming panther happened in the comics  but a. that had nothing to do with replacing a resting real life person  and b. that clearly isn t the reason as to why its being done  not saying that anyone doesnt understand just saying that isn t the reason  just like melonie said. its the m-she-u  funny term btw never heard it before now .
the thing with iron heart is even though she wasn t a great character in the comics they have a chance to make her good in the movies since they can change her up without upsetting most people. Im not particularly excited to she her but you never know  just like guardians of the galaxy a lot of people especially comicbooks fans weren t all too excited for them but it became one of the most loved marvel films.
I would like to see this movie. hot take...I actually liked the first one. I hope this one will be good. its sad that chadwick boseman passed. he was a God actor and I liked him as the black panther. I saw a photo of all the new avengers and they all minus the new  captain america  were all woman. I love it when you interject tomb raider in your video s . Im not that interested in the iron heart being add. and midnights edge last night was good  great to see you there  left a meassge saying that on twitter . great vidoe melonie. I love to hear your takes. until next time.
this all is happening so fast  and its super unfortunate we only got to spend 4 movies with chadwick has bp. rest in peace. we mourn in real life and we will mourn in the movie  but accelerating shurI into position is a challenging process for me to think about. bp was pretty established  it feels kind of hindering and unsettling to see change so early.
fair overview on the trailer and good message. about injecting not successful or not well known characters into successful franchises to jump start them is a very comic book thing to do.
I dont know if shurI will stay in the black panther mantle for long. if you noticed in the first wakanda forever trailer  her mother says  I am queen of the most powerful nation in the world! and my entire family is gone. have I not given everything
to your example of a quintessential actress playing lara croft and then later being replaced  I would argue that angelina jolie will be hard to top  and thatshe still has the acting chops  and the body  to pull it off.  or...  if they want to use the  new  lara  maybe mel cantry for the part.  bring her back to what she was supposed to be.
can I just say thank you for doing what you do - fighting woke crap !
I think we ve had so many  women 1-upping men in their own stories  that the movie will still get trashed even if it ends up being pretty good. Im mostly thinking about moon knight and how layla was treated. she s worked alongside marc  and either struggles to beat or gets saved by marc steven during the final battle. but she falcon kicked harrow that one time while he was preoccupied with marc  and that means she was meant to emasculate moon knight  even though it wasn t her that ultimately turned the tables on harrow.
shurI became the black panther in the comics legitimately when tchalla stepped down as black panther. not much as a stretch to see her take over since its happened before.
if you absolutely cant recast him then killmonger and shurI are the only two options. Im okay with shurI as bp  however I belive these characters. are bigger then the actors that portray them. for some people bp was their favorite hero weill chadwick was a little kid still.and if you have ever seen chadwick in interviews he absolutely loves the impact his character had on everyone. I almost argue he would not be in favor of taking his character who was so loved out of the story
nothing that exists as  a means to an end  can be good. I hope people learn thatsooner than later.
its quite possible due to the whole mutliverse mess this could be a potential set up to introduce a new actor to play the role by bringing another bp from a different universe. keeping chad s original place while also allowing a new actor to take up the rolealso  didn t kill monger burn all the ritual flowers that ever existed making chad s bp to be the last possible one  I wonder how marvel is going to retcon this
I think thats kind of the problem here. bp characters have always been excellent in pretty much every scene they ve had. in all movies. there s no actual reason to doubt this. wakandan men have never been weak.   it would kill marvel as a whole to make these particular men so.
@alyssa allan  true. but that wont stop them from immigrating men from the few remaining non minorities  and making a mockery of them if need be. honestly I am still expecting them to ask bruce for reparations.
they could revive killmonger and put tchalla s spirit inside him easy fix
@s m  im choosing to see the best in not marvel but the wakandan franchise. its too big   too important for them to mess around with. plus  its part of chadwick s legacy. they may mess up pt 3  but they wouldn t dare on this one or they ll lose half the world  if not more. all will be spectacular
@summer  I think that would be an insane choice. we d need at least one movie in between if they were going to completely try to reincarnate bps spirit  but even then.. to try to redo chadwick s energy seems insensitive. shurI is the right   respectful choice  imo. Im always down for discussions!
@alyssa allan  it wasn t insensitive when they recast dumbledore or spartacus. micheal b jordan is a good pick for bp especially if he keeps his mask on and make it a contention point for the next movie. killmonger made a lot of enemies and no one knows its tchalla in there setting up an appearance of the panther God to all of wakanda. perfect mcu story.
wokeness means horrible writing. Im all for diversity and having message. as long as its delivered in a fantastic story with awesome characters.
@alyssa allan  wakanda isn t a franchise.  nor is a comic book movie big or important.  also who is the  half the world  you think cares   come back to reality.
youre right and he s one of my favorites. the multIverse is the perfect way to introduce a new actor as black panther. its just the timing.
personally Im boycotting. if the push is to give it all to women let them have it I wont be giving them my money to watch more girl power bs
Imean reboots are a thing  maybe with this cast  they wanted to honor this version of t challa and not recast him. just like with spiderman  superman  and batman  in the future  he will get a new actor with a new cast.
@rikariegaming  you think so  because the rest of the cast are women. itseems like a push to completely replace men
@afrodisciple88  cope and seethe
I agree with everything you said except for the part about his rogues gallery. I love black panther but his rogues gallery is nowhere near the level of batman  spiderman or superman s. maybe cap and iron man s  but not the other guys.
@rikariegaming  thats not gonna happen for a very long time. they d have to reboot the entire mcu since its all one continuity and one franchise.
@madison  less seethe more wasted time they get worse every iteration wonder woman not the 1990 one is the only good female empowerment film look at star wars not worth it marvel not worth terminator new fate not worth it charles angels 3 not worth it they are empty boring bring nothing if its a female lead skip it
people would probably get pissed because the actor died. they d probably say some bullshit like he owned the character
@alexandro corona  thats what s already happening
@madison  youre she-hulks one fan huh
I still feel like they should have casted michael jaI white as the new black panther.
@mahogany sins  or y lan noel.
@mahogany sins  thats my boy but he s like 53 thats to old
we see her fight in the mcu dont we  plus im sure if namor is gonna lose it is not in a fist fight so her  fighting ability doesnt really matter. I think this bp suit is gonna be more tech assisted which is shurI s specialty.
that kinda makes her very similar to tony stark.
@chocochib  right
@tim tam  definitely
and black panther had nearly 50 years before adding a female version
@tim tam  yeah she s just as smart as the guy with multiple phds and a lifetime of experience in weapons tech. without any schooling at all. mary. sue.
@tim tam  right
@david jones  to be fair  tony stark went to school in the us and shurI went to school in super hidden hi-tech fantasy land.
depends if this is durring the 5 years of the snap. by the end you can easily say black panther is back after everyone is brougnt backby black panther 3 people would be more open to a recast
well actually  in the comics   not  recent ones  t challa gets badly injured and cannot be black panther for a while  but the villain is still rampaging and needs to be dealt with. his sister  cant remember her name  decides to step up as black panther temporarily to help defeat the villain. but I am 99  positive that they will make her the new black panther and completely ruin both her and black panthers stories  personalities  etc etc...
agreed. I feel like its kind of simple. make the movie a proper tribute to chad and let an established character in shurI go through a genuine development arc. dont politicize the villain s motive to project the writer s feefees  try to at least get to the first avengers level of cgI quality  do the standard badass end fight with a good score. credits. I have zero faith thatsuch an easy set of criteria will be followed but I will see for myself at the very least
reason why m she u started is because if you see the how must of ever product in phase 4 has mostly all women saving the male hero in a fight or have bigger role.
they are definitely trying to make money off his death. this movie was originally suppose to release on the 2 year anniversary of chadwick s death but the woman who played shurI didn t want to get the vaccine and she also got hurt badly on set so the movie got pushed back to now. they rush the hell out of the production of this movie and I suspect it wont be that good. even the actors of the movie are already telling people to calm down their expectations of the movie.
@pokemonashgreen2  exactly  I watched doctor strange and I noticed something was odd about the whole film. they downplayed doctor strange power to upgrade chavez  the female   b.s
here s the issue this switch is canon in the black panther comics the original black panther dies and his sister due to the power of succession in wakanda became queen so she took over as the black panther
Imean someone has to be black panther nothing you can do about it. they are sticking to the comics so its not like its forced upon us or making female look better then men. seems yall forgot mbaku is in this movie and was stated to have a bigger role and impact in this movie.
@kinihun25  what are you saying  lol none of what you said is true. if its pushed back from its original release date then how was it rushed  and no actors said to calm down their expectations of the movie. they all were hyped for this movie to come out
@sockmonkey gaming  winston duke said  to calm down our expectations for the movie.
@kinihun25  winston said  its also important to let go of any expectation that this movie will be black panther 1. this is going to be its own thing. this narrative has evolved  and its changed  just like all the characters and the circumstances of wakanda itself. for me in particular  I just had to let go of the expectation of this being anything like the first movie and allow this movie to be its own thing.  different doesnt equate to the movie not being that good. the film had to become something else after chadwick passed. whatever previous plans had to be reworked. the actors had to come things from a different perspective and you hear this in all of their interviews. coogler had to come at the story different. but everyone has talked about honoring chadwick with this film and I dont think they re trying to honor him with a film that isn t good. I dont know... keep the faith. I know its an mcu phase 4 film  but coogler and the cast may just surprise a lot of people.
@pokemonashgreen2  the fact that we had 3 phases of male s in the limelight and now we have one phase with females sharing the limelight and people are freaking out is a bit telling. now I ll admit  some of the she-hulk shenanigans can be a bit cringe and come off quite forced  but the alarmist reaction of some so-called fans is even more annoying. I have a theory that most the people on here crying are actually disgruntled snyderverse fans masquerading as mcu fans that just want to see marvel fall.
lmao thats not going to happened
@sosoliquid  yeah I know but the opportunity is there definitely not close like gotg but they could still make her a better character in the movies then comics  but like I said Im not excited for her character so if they do or not is fine with me lol
congrats youre the shortlisted winner s of the ongoing playstation5 giveaway contest.....
copium
@gustavo chairez  but they aren t  haven t you been paying attention
thats their strategy  however its not working out that way  personally I dont need to see any female versions of male characters.  why does wonder woman work so well  because there was no wonder man that preceded her.
@brandon poole  also I think super hero fatigue is boiling up.
I dont think his family s take on what they do with the fictional character is relevant to the actor himself  in this situation . thats why I feel like its safe to say their input on the matter isn t 100  relevant. but also there s no winning by recasting him immediately. even with his family s blessing and text at the opening saying the film is dedicated to the actor. its hard to make it not come off as tasteless the moment it opens up to him being replaced and the show going on without him. thats assuming your mom who doesnt know how to use a smartphone  your girlfriend thatstays on twitter and started binging marvel after infinity war  and everyone else in the theater has stayed read up on what chadwick boseman s family has said about recasts. not to mention the shoes you d have to fill as an actor while audiences are already having to prematurely part with the portrayal they love.. nobody wins here.
so for one  what his family wants is wholly irrelevant to any of this. they re his family yes  but they re not producing or creating the movie. two  it was absolutely too soon. y all always mention recasting without considering how that would ve effected everyone involved. the cast had just lost their dear friend and you expect them to grieve by replacing tchalla with a new actor so soon   then no one talks about how if they d recast  how the new actor would ve faced an unfair amount of scrutiny and criticism because he would constantly be compared to chadwick. imagine the chemistry on thatset  ugh it would be awkward as hell. feige was 100  right  it was too soon. coogler decided the best action was to shift the focus to the supporting cast  and since shurI takes up the mantle in the comics  it checks out. I doubt she ll be the bp moving forward  but it was the best way to go..
@kace the great   feige knows better than his family  you made a fair argument for the new guy facing high expectations  but saying that feige was more right to do so is irreversably stupid. as well as saying that the cast losing a friend is more tragic than losing a brother or a son. also as fine of an argument for the new guy was thatsame thing could just as easily apply to letitia wrong. and ofc she s gonna be bp moving forward cause of woke garbage completely taking over marvel for the sake of money. comment as much as you want after this you will not be getting another reply.
it was a perfectly average marvel movie  overhyped like hell  but no worse than doctor strange or ant man and by no means a bad movie.
@boomer town slap  I actually thought the first dr strange was underrated  stephen had the perfect arc in that film and he had to overcome his arrogance and controlling nature  which multiverse of madness fucked
@henry gambles  yeah  but it is also almost a copy of iron man but with magic instead of armor
@boomer town slap  true but having a similar the same basic plot isn t a bad thing  it depends on execution and whilst by no means perfect or outstanding dr strange was well written and even presented interesting concepts and had a hero s journey!
she becomes black panther in the comics
@phoolish roc  for five issues and then stops. stop acting like she entirely took over. even if she did  that wouldn t be a great argument  because at the time she was black panther  marvel was doing its whole  give female spin-offs a male character s book  thing. the era  as a whole  was poorly received  and referencing anything from it is not a smart move to make.
@john  point is  it all happened in the source material. plus  the multiverse also exists in the comics
@phoolish roc  yes the disney version that wasn t received well and nobody asked for  that era effectively killed comics
damn if they kill off shurI too that would be crazy. cause I think the 1st movie did that as well with the trailer having tchallas ending speech at. who knows  namor is op so maybe she might get killed
nah  that would be the queen before she gets killed. her getting killed is the push shurI needs to be consoled by nakia to finally perfect the artificial flower needed to become a black panther. makes the most sense with where they are going with this.
they need to bring back michael b. jordan somehow.
@john durham  flashbacks
nice try but you didnt watch it
facts....just got to be written right
shurI was literally bp for like 5 issues dude...and it wasn t even on the main timeline... chadwick and his family both stated that the role of bp was bigger than him or any actor...his family has let there feelings be known that they disagreed with killing off the character..
@robert grey  but she was bp dude. even if its for one panel  she was bp. you can find problems with everything if you dig long enough. I can respect his families feelings on the character  but it comes down to what marvel wants to do with it.  every decision in movies doesnt have to come down to woke or not.
@pisces concepts  tell that to his family...
@robert grey  Im sure marvel studios and kevin feige have already.
I dont care if she s black panther in the comics. the mcu version is one of the most annoying characters in the series
t challa didn t step down  he was in a coma.
t challa was in a coma and would later wake up. shurI ruled for some time while t challa was in the avengers and bast then made him king of the dead
Im not familiar with the lore  but I am not really interested in seeing shurI as black panther. I would rather see the masculine rendition.
@idawg  couldn t agree more. her character is down right fucking insufferable
that was still woke garbage in the comics  just like jane foster becoming  thor  while thor odinson was doing his quest of redemption  all in the comics of course .
was that legit canon written by  real marvel  or a fake timeline written by  disney marvel
shurI taking the mantle of black panther happened back in 2010... just at the beginning of the  woke  culture crisis. so  while it is marvel canon  its not pure  marvel  comic fandom  which died somewhere around 1989.
preach   pisces concepts   preach
@maxian cambridge  thanks  its all good  no harm in sharing opinions
her time as bp was very brief  and that version of shurI was believable as a warrior. this shurI is useless without her tech.
tchalla was put in a coma by dr. doom.
yeah but since actor dies for some reason character has to die too  should ve recasted.  disney marvel have no balls
no thanks
@  pisces conceptstrue for a short while  but we re still dealing with people who have some pretty foul ideals. propaganda is at its most dangerous and effective when it doesnt comes across as extreme.
@pisces concepts  if you think like that you can consider everything to be authentic what these nutjobs have done.
its also woke in the comics.  imagine a teenage girl being the smartest person in the mcu and the most powerful warrior.
maybe they can pull a ahsoka from star wars and make fans love shuri. however  they should ve recasted bosemn but marvel are to fucking stupid and money hungry oh and wokeity woke
why couldn t they just find another male actor
even then that was by a unique circumstance and her in movie is too different to even consider the same person to do that  they have to hard logic leap to get her to bp ability for mcu
tchalla didn t step down! he was deemed unworthy by the panther God and loses his powers hence y the brat took the title.
problem is thatshurI is like 5 5  and about 102 lbs  and there are no more flowers left after black panther  in the mcu world anyway. so now they have to invent some other way  which will probably be bs  but whatever let s go with it  to make a tiny girl capable of tossing around men 2  times her size and many times stronger.more than any of that though  shurI is annoying and actually shades of racist as well. Imean  derogatorily calling random white men  colonizer   why have her do that  as if the answer to racism to be racist as well and judge people s character based on their skin colour.
@music  wasn t she a terrible black panther in the comic  not to mention bast rejected her until she proved herself. dont know if thats woke but since she s a black young woman I guess her breathing is still gonna be woke
@chocochib  her breathing is not what woke means.  being the smartest and strongest character in the mcu as a teen is.
still tho its only been 1 black panther movie  you know how long it takes to write  direct  film  and edit a mcu movie  especially around the time black panther first dropped they took most likely 3-5 years on a movie. chadwick would ve had to let mcu know about his cancer so honestly mcu would ve known about his upcoming death for both black panther and civil war if thats the case why didn t they either a fire him or b prepare for a recast and make shurI the new black panther 2-3 movies into black panther series  its stupid mcu never followed the comics accurately until now since they want every character to be a independent female or a gay man
the problem is that their womanizing the entire mcu  they should ve recast t challa or bring back killmonger for a redemption arc
@pisces concepts  right
feige already said that they dont care about comics canon when writing.
yeah but although I love that actress in other things  shurI is an insufferably annoying character. if you dont think she s gonna be a mary sue idk what to tell you. she s already basically  smarter than stark . dumb af
@lalaland23lalaland  he was in a coma get you facts right
yah its bs because its not cannon they made shurI bp in the late 2010s and that was to promote that feminist equality bs cant have a strong black male character
@music  looking at the numbers spider-man is objectively stronger than every other hero
that version of shurI was an actual warrior. she had years of combat training  led forces in battle and was a skilled tactician. the mcu version of shurI has... none of that. she has shown little to no combat ability and she has the personality of a 12 year old. a very smart 12 year old sure  but a 12 year old nonetheless.
those comics also flopped.
@music  yeah and the comics flopped.
@robert grey  well its mot their character. marvel has the final say
so  do you think this will be good
they wont learn  they will only consume
if they had made a story for the first one that didn t go all gangsta   bringing killmonger in for the second would have been sweet  but like many of marvel s choices of late - they seem to keep missing the bus.
Im hearing great things about werewolf by night biggest complaint is its too short. bp 2 I bet will be good no matter what definitely looks more interesting than the first. Im sure thatsherrI will be fine as pb I also think they are going to recast tachila. I heard that this movie takes place during the blip so we will see.
im actually digging the whole mayan culture with namor  evening mentioning the ancient mayan God kukulkan. as a honduran with mayan roots  im actually excited for this.
Im hoping they make the movie more of a tribute and since shurI like a black panther she only steps up at the very end and be like for my brother. but imo I was hoping nbaku would ve became black panther I feel he deserved it more
I would like to think that everyone will give this movie a chance to prove that its not going to follow the  wokeness  in its entirety  not only out of respect for chadwicks contribution and passing but because everyone loved shuris charecter of being smart  intellectual  funny  strong  down to earth and willing to fight for what is right.hopefully they haven t spoiled this with the  wokeness  stuff  so I guess that it is going to be watched by a lot of people with caution on their minds and I hope that marvel will take a step back and give it a few weeks to let itsink in and see the results of their work. if it gets people singing and dancing in africa like the first bp movie did  then I guess that we could consider it a success
I hope its good I ll go see it opening day  Im mostly going because  Im a huge fan of doctor doom.if your unaware doctor doom got namor to attack wakanda  so he could steal the vibranium  that has the ability to enhance magical powers.he also puts nanites in their food and water  and makes them human cameras  so he can see and here all their moves.
its not out yet but I will say the trailer definitely looks pretty good. Im actually excited to see it honestly.
I think someone in the movie  should have mentioned that t challa realized he could be an 100   effective leader and black panther  especially now that warkanda has really be one part of the world. so he has passed on the mantle of black panther. he has changed things in one aspect  why not another. of course the leader of wakanda wouldn t be seen in the movie
this was a great video! Im really liking this channel  and points you bring up are a lot more thought out than what other channels say. Im gonna give this movie a shot  like you said marvel has been making trash lately..and not just with all its woke stuff  but I also hate how they ve turned every character into a comedian pretty much.
what if the queen has seen enough death in her life and now has decided to take over the mantle herself  thats just my theory  and I wouldn t be disappointed in seeing that
spot on melonie  the only way they could get it to work is if shurI has to earn the title throughout the film maybe even getting injured or almost dying  hell maybe ramonda is killed in front of shurI as a way to emphasize what s at stake  angela basset is a great actress but the mcu s lack of stakes after phase 4 has been pulling me out of their films  itseems like no way home and technically moon knight were the only ones that got that memo!
it could be good. I like letitia wright as a person. but I have zero hope current year writers can do this well
everything but rirI is looking good  im curious how they handle her  hopefully not like the comics.
I would usually love to see shurI as bp like the comics  but mcu shurI is so different than she is in the comics idk how well it ll work. but Im willing to give it a chance.still think the best move would ve been to recast t challa  something even chadwick himself supported. but this is what we got now so this is where we are.
after being disappointed with thor love and thunder  she-hulk and multiverse of madness  the last 30-40 minutes of doctor strange was the only good part  Im a bitskeptical. I did enjoy black panther so I am actually excited for shurI to take up the mantle  dont care much for namor and ironheart.
I am hopeful too. I enjoyed the first black panther and I believe this is the same director. that being said I am still scared that they will inject it with personal politics instead of focusing on storytelling.
its ok to be hopeful. I am so burned by disney star wars and disney marvel I have lost faith in their ability to do good adaptations. I will wait to hear your review  disparu and nerdrotics before Imake a decision to see it.
shurI was black panther in the comics yes but not for very long her stint as the character was short and t challa came right back and claimed it. her taking the mantle wasn t popular or they would ve kept it that way.
Im loving these video s on a regular basis. stay cool mel!
good video  for me the  mantle argument  can be great at times and super weak at times. the difference with black panther and say iron man  since we ll be seeing forms of both in this movie  is black panther was specifically created to be a mantle. in the lore the  mantle  of black panther is passed down from one to another. where as for many others its created for a specific character  but then latched on to because itsells well. so Im fine with her becoming the black panther because to me it makes the most sense at the moment.
she-hulk made me worry about everything else thats coming
I think he calls his homeland talokan  I think it works too  pretty sure mayan aztec cultures reference they came from aztlan  which sounds like atlantis to me.
@jon snowden  you are correct. im hoping they will speak yucatec maya language. my grandmother would still speak it. a very beautiful language and ancient as well.
namor was the sub-mariner and he debuted back in 1939 in the marvel comics of the same name. though he wasn t mayan  he was just the son of a sea captain and an atlantean. dc s aquaman is actually a ripoff of the sub-mariner
@aaron hill  this is accurate. namor isn t mayan in the comics and in the submariner animated series in the 60s.
looks like woke trash to me. a race swapped namor  a gender swapped black panther  and Goddamned ironheart! gonna boycott this movie and its merch.
@scott doesntmatter  honestly surprised you even saw a movie with that many black people in it must have been your first and a experience lmao
cultural appropriation
@harden j.i.d  nope. and frankly  I dont like the implication of what you wrote.
@scott doesntmatter  hahaha I wonder why
@harden j.i.d  mostly because your statement indicated prejudice.
@scott doesntmatter  it was more than an indication but if Ive learned anything its that you guys can be a little slow sometimes especially on the realization of who s really laughing at you
@scott doesntmatter  as are yours  but here we are in a world where everyone needs to share their opinion constantly to feel important in a quickly crumbling world.maybe tomorrow you ll be able to find another thing to share your opinion on to keep you from feeling the crushing weight of the collapse of society
yeah its an epic I think thats why the movie length. the tribute n story and then transition to namor  the govt
why  what has disney marvel done to deserve that
ngl  that would be cool to see.
how does rirI not look good  we saw one shot of her in her suit thats about it. and not like the comics  tf is thatsuppose to mean
@sockmonkey gaming  ironheart was a terrible series  at least the first few in the line I didn t bother after that. its actually the series that got me to stop buying marvel comics. they need a different origin story for her than stealing starks suit and being better than him  after all war-marching has already done that.
@irish  Imean kate does the same with hawkeye and no one complains. she uses a bow and can fight. she builds suits and is smart idk what you can do to make her different. Imean this version it doesnt seem like she steals a suit and we aren t 100  sure they are gonna make her  better  than stark
miles morales went from one of the worst marvel character to some of peoples favourites after itsv. he also wasnt good in the comics so I dont see why rirI cant be as good if not better.
I dont even have any hopes for deadpool 3  I really dont. its sad  really.
eric mccoy thank you. everyone keeps ignoring that fact. plus that version of shurI taking over for t challa was believable. she trained long and hard because she wanted to be and storm endorsed her for it.  mcu shurI is overly reliant on her tech and not much of a fighter.  I bet money thatsomehow in wakanda forever shurI will be the greatest  black panther ever and all she ever did was sit in her lab and nothing else.
congrats youre the shortlisted winner s of the ongoing playstation5 giveaway contest..
I was hoping to see okoye hold the mantle of the black panther since she s the general of the dora milaje. it would make sense  since she has the most combat experience out of everyone in the country  plus danaI has the ability to be a main character very well . however I understand why they went the route they re going. Im really excited to watch it. good video!
I really hope atleast sharing becomes the new black panther......she is great in the comics and the actress that plays her is awesome and classy
can it be good   yes.will it be good   no.
I have no doubts the people who worked with and knew chadwick boseman want to do his memory justice and make an excellent black panther movie. Im just worried about how phase 4 has been going  the higher-ups in marvel disney aren t going to agree and want to push some message or narrative.
the namor being aztec thing makes sense because there is a theory that the aztec empire was built by atlantian refugees. the capital city mazatl n means new atlas.  not really but in the theory
tchalla will be back  e.g. in secret wars kang dynasty. this film is specifically about his absence making wakanda vulnerable.
I honestly have no idea how it will turn out. the trailers look genuine and emotional  and it looks like they really want to live up to the legacy t challa left behind. hopefully it wont be more phase 4 garbage
I actually really liked the first one and I think Imight go see this one. I agree that the first one stood on its own even though it has been sometime it feels really weird having a movie with the death of chadwick boseman in it  I wonder what he would have wanted for this character  Im being cautious but optimistic
I think it has a really good chance being good. especially if they pay a good homage to chadwick and t challa.
I liked the trailer  so Im holding out hope this will be great.
you my lady  are a gem. great channel   great review work. best of luck  have a great day.
really hope its good.  probably wait for melonie mac s feedback before spending money at the theater
great video malonie. I am looking forward to wakanda forever because of a couple of things. first namor is coming to the mcu since he is one of the first heroes of sorts in marvel s history I am excited to see how he is in the film. also I think shurI will be amazing  characters passing the mantle to a new generation have been common in comics  graphic novels and mangas for ages  heck in storytelling all together. so I dont find it an issue. black panther is still amazing superhero and a few characters have donned the black panther name. also I am hispanic and its great to see how the mayan culture will bring to the mcu with namor.maybe I am the oddball here but I am enjoying the marvel mcu content as of late. I know it has its issues dont get me wrong no story is perfect but they are enjoyable to say the least  to me that is. people s opinions will vary. I really dont get the whole  msheu  moniker  since marvel has had a bunch of women heroes for ages even in marvel s early history as well. that term confuses me. but anyways great video and you bring up alot of great points. rock on!
that happened with spartacus when andy whitfield died. he was the man and was irreplaceable but the show went on. the same could ve been done with t challa.
I think this ll be good- possibly much better than black panther 1st film. ryan coogler is a good storyteller  and they course corrected to fans response to recasttchalla. even heard tyron magnus shout it out. maybe feige will listen
yeah they dont have an option on recasting. sadly if you want another movie they have to either use a former side character or pick the second place guy to take over the role. at least she will have the excuse and be super powered   super suited to explain her abilities.
from a story perspective  I think it makes sense. the black panther title is a handed down role. t challa s father was the black panther. when he died  the role went to the eldest heir. with t challa s death  the next heir is shurI so it makes complete sense why she would become black panther.that doesnt relate to any opinions on namor  iron heart or the movie itself. just the idea of shurI being black panther
they could have recast tchalla if they allowed enough time between the two movies.
fans aren t against women.  fans are against unopposed misandry.  this movie is looking to turn out amazing  and Im confident it will respect boseman s legacy while encouraging the world to move forward despite the loss.now ironheart... that mary-sue is who Im worried about.  but the fact that rirI is being handled by this team might actually improve the character over her comic counterpart.
chadwick boseman s brother said that chadwick would ve wanted the character to live on and continue in the mcu.
daniaI gurira is doing a twd spinoff now
pretty sure only the royal line can be a panther though
@ceooflowrolls  I wasn t aware of the royal blood aspect. maybe retcon her as a descendant from one of the tribes to fit the narrative but if they stay to it as is then no I guess she wouldn t be able to.
@I like cinema  or just make the one next in line the new black panther  what s the point with over complicating it
but thats the thing... the first one was heavy on the malcom-esque revolutionary killmonger. actual woke not what rt-wingers ridicule as  woke
congrats youre the shortlisted winner s of the ongoing playstation5 giveaway contest......
why should they kill a character off because the actor died  and you clapping for that
@isonguyo samuel  not really clapping just hopeful it is good. I think the mcu is going to have a hard reboot after this phase.
Im hopeful for the movie  as I loved the first one.  Im more worried about the insertion of rirI williams than anything else.
regarding recasting with marvel. they really should be doing it I believe. if you look at james bond  doctor who  even animated classics. recasting is the norm to keep the story going. with marvel I feel like Im being cheapened by not seeing stories I saw in the comics. like I was wanting to see tony face magical enemies. I want to see an angry hulk destroy earth s hero s. these stories will be nerfed or never told.
not sure about the movie but the actress that plays shurI seems cool. I think I remember her getting flak for being against the mandates  I liked the first movie but I also thought it was a bit overrated by some.  shrug
I dream about a perfect lara croft movie too.
its in the comics so it kinda works I really wanted to see killmonger coming back  a becoming the rightful king
Im new here but I like your content a lot definitely glad I subscribed
wow melonie mac. getting there at 60k. congratulations and looking beautiful and badass too. as for the movie trailer for wakanda forever  I dont think I will watch it. I think this movie isn t going to do for me. this movie isn t going to be good. Imean who knows tbh. but  like you said . what if it does well  who knows. cause marvel has been pushing bs woke crap lately. like she hulk and bad movies like thor love and thunder. ppl now have mixed feelings on how marvel pushes movies now and tv shows. like who knows tbh.
Im glad an actress from my country gets to be the main character in an mcu movie and play none other than the black panther. Im expecting this movie to be like 3 hours long since the plot is so heavy. if its under 2 hours then it ll definitely forced and will probably feel rushed.
as someone who knows the look dev who is in charge of the final battle scene...let s just say they re-shoot that part a few weeks ago and now they have to re-add everythingplease dont be mad when the cgI gonna look like crap they are doing their best with so little time they had
it could work.  they could make it great  actually.  the question is whether they re going to... and Im not confident in the least  about that.
you honestly look great in this video for whatever reason.  I hope the crazy unrelated drama youre expressing during this whole video works out for you.
they will recast him but not the way that erease the original one... they will use the secret war as they did in the comic  to fuse 2 or more universe into one that will become the the new main universe and that will be combination of other superheros universo... they can add the new black pantha for other universe to the new one and will still be good without change too much
I hope its good! Im so tired of being branded racist for not liking their woke crap.
I was in the movie theater when I first saw the bpwf trailer  but they played it immediately after the trailer for the second avatar movie  and I couldn t tell the difference between the two  I thought it was one long ass avatar trailer. lol
as someone who grew up with the mcu I hope its good  even with the changes to namor which I actually love what they did with him  but its modern mcu so the chances of it being good aren t high.
it ll be a messits trying to do too much  shurI becoing bp  explaining t challa away  namor origin and changes  rirI origin and whatever phase work for phase 4 that wont go anywhere its too filled and we see how that goes every time  strange mom
good lawd people. shurI was black panther for awhile in the actual comics. of course in the comic she took over while he was in a coma and not because he died  but she s already a recognized character from the movies so itseemed like the obvious choice.
this was always their plan though  itsaved them half a decade of movies and they could move forward with their plans for an all woman avengers movie faster  this is probably why their shows have been terrible lately because they just want to establish their m-she-u asap without caring about actual stories.
I get the skepticism. marvel phase 4  right  but  I dont know. I have faith this film wont fall into the  usual traps  for a few reasons. one  the director  ryan coogler. in a recent interview  he expressed not only his love for chadwick boseman but how he wanted to quit filmmaking after chadwick passed. not  not direct another black panther  but quit his livelihood. thats how much chadwick meant to this man. as black panther and as a human being. two  the cast repeatedly refer to chadwick as big brother. angela basset saw chadwick as her own son. they all continuously mention wanting to honor chadwick with this movie. honor his legacy. that was is priority for them. not an agenda. listen to their interviews  we re not hearing the same buzz words as we ve heard with other shows and movies. its about beauty  chadwick  family and exploring new parts of wakanda. before there was an m-she-u  black panther was surrounded by strong female characters  shurI  his mother  the dora milaje . all we re seeing is these characters be brought to the forefront in light of his passing. because honestly  who else would be  will they recast t challa  I think they will  in time. it may not be the t challa of this world  but I do think a t challa will be in the mcu again. we re dealing with the multiverse  anything is possible. I just feel in my bones  in my soul  that this movie might as well be called chadwick boseman forever  because thats more so what this is all about. honoring chadwick. this t challa. even feige knows that. I think this might be the closest thing we get to an honest passion project in the mcu. key word  passion. now  look  I could totally be wrong. its possible. and if I am  I ll be greatly disappointed. heck  I wanted black widow to be the greatest female superhero film going  and I was disappointed. Im a tv writer. my father passed 2 years before chadwick. he was a pastor. I have written 7 scripts since that time. 3 my own. 4 for the show Im staffed on. when youre honoring someone  you fight for every inch of story on that page  during that production and in that editing room  because it means so much. I feel that passion in these trailers. that attention to detail and making a product that your loved one can be proud of. and thats the third reason  both trailers are so different from anything else in phase 4. all this just to say  there s good reason to remain optimistic for this film. thanks for indulging my little essay here    God bless you  melonie.
what s weird is Im looking forward to about 90  of the movie  the only part Im iffy on...is ironheart  like I just dont know how they re gonna translate the character from the comic into movies and just really hesitant about that aspect of the movie
the actress that plays shurI lmao I get heat for critquing it...when y all dont even know her name!! chadwick  chadwick  chadwick... actress that plays shurI sure  its gonna be a riot angela bassett - see  I too can name actual famous people
thank you
thank you so much
@melonie mac go boom   its not woke Ive read the comics were shrI was the black panther it was sad that chadwick past away but its in the comics
there is some sort of argument here for actressing  yeah until youremember this is the same studio that made she-hulk.
yeah  I was gonna say that there s precedent for this in the comics  but you caught it there in the middle. another thing to note  and I see this a lot in comments sections across the board  is people not understanding how the mantel works  asking for m baku to be black panther. he cant take up the mantel since he worships hanuman  the ape God. he doesnt recognize bast  the panther God  and eating the heart shaped herb would kill him.
what Im wondering is if they wrote this after endgame or before endgame.
I think we need to wait for the movie to determine if its woke but to my knowledge her becoming the black panther makes sense because the black panther isn t a individual person.
I would like it to be good but I am starting to see stuff thats made me dubious in the past that turned out to be true.if anything I think it may be trying to do too much in one film  Imean iron heart was going to be a hard sell as even in the comics she was doing terribly and the comics version didn t have to fill rdjs boots now this one has to fill rdjs boots while not having a full film to herself so her plot will be crammed into the middle of the war plot that looks to be the main story.I dont think sharI should have taken up the black panther role at least not yet  the panther is a melee fighter but sharI is a tech she is an engineer she isn t trained enough  in the mcu  now this could be fixed if the film has a long enough arc  the Lord of the rings book from bilbos party to the end of the story covers 90 years  say if the start of the film with tchallas funeral to her taking up the mantle is several years of her training with the dora milaje that ied be ok with but if we are only talking weeks or months I cant buy that it dosnt gel with what we already know of the setting.personally ied have liked  Im sorry for this but I suck at names when their western  Im also dyslexic  omboco or however his name is spelled the leader of the mountain tribe to take up the role  the actor seems to have the charisma to pull it off and there is the theory that he had already taken the heart shaped herb  the character also seemed to be quite smart  we then could have had him hand to mantle off to sharI after she had spent a few years training up while still been his tech guy.
this movie might be the only hope for my love to marvel comics
I do like the look of the mask  with the spotted designs across the forehead
doing a bit of catch up in reverse  saddened that you aren t doing the Bible verse thing at the end of your videos anymore  have yet to get to the video where you stopped   but   you do you. the mention of jane becoming thor is really why this comment  in the comics. to think of it they were fairly close to the comic origin with the recent thor movie. granted there was a lot of adapting for the movie  jane thor and thor fighting gor rather than past thor  present thor  and future thor fighting gor  and the humor  which may have been both taika watitI s and chris hemsworth s humors together -comparing the humor to their other movies  which unfortunately does feel like mcu thor digressed to before the events of the first movie.
iron heart means rdj comes back as ai... thats a pretty solid move on mcu s part.
I really thought if chadwick didn t pass away  shurI would make a great iron heart  in the comics  rirI   iron heart  didn t work because she just showed up and tried to  take over  iron man s position while characters like miles morales worked because he was introduces to interact with peter parker so it truly felt like the torch was being passed. shurI is already loved and could have a connection to iron man by being inspired by his story during endgame. as it is  narratively speaking  shurI being the next black panther makes sense but I felt like its unfortunate we ll just have some new character come in out of no where but I want to believe the movies will resist  woke-washing  and bring a good story. the trailer makes itseem it ll be taken seriously because dragging this movie through the mud with unnecessary agenda would be way to disrespectful to chadwick.
this really looks great. unlike many other heroes  this change of gender seems more organic. it honors the original and just makes sense in light of the real world passing of boseman. its not gender-bending to make a political statement- its more of a carrying on of a legacy.
well  there s a huge leap in difference between the writing from 2009 and the current day.
the first was azmzing! I hope marvel does the second movie well.
reimagine tomorrow  is still the main mantra of dissknee.need a clean house to see a change in the industry  no weed left behind.
Im cautiously optimistic about this one given the circumstances. I think shurI looks good. will be enough to drown out nerdrotic s voice in the back of my head  who I agree with   dunno
wakanda forever s use of shurI as black panther makes perfect sense. you can get a good set up for this with the netflix episode what if... killmonger rescued tony stark . I watched it for the first time last night and am excited to see the future. I do not like a lot of the decisions and directions marvel has taken this phase of mcu  but this one makes total sense.
I love j. scott campbell s art.
chadwick boseman s family said on multiple occasions that the actor s wish is to see black panther recast  something like  the best way to honor him would be to keep the role alive  according to his brother. so yeah  ignore his dying wish feige...
idk if this will be good or not. I dont particularly like shurrI as a character but she fine I would rather see umbacku or watever become black panther or mayb make a way where kill monger comes back and have a redemption arc. I liked the first black panther and he was my favorite part of civil war along with spider man so we will just see
I wasn t really a black panther reader  but he is the protector and king of wakanda.  his younger and only sister  shurI  took the role of leadership when he was in a coma for awhile.  I had to look up shurI  whose entrance to the stories is 2005  long after Im reading comics.  taking up the mantle for her brother while he s on the side-lines is acceptable.  but if we are to imagine the rituals and battles to become protector  shurI probably would not make the cut.  this is not ignoring the capabilities of women  but if we are to envision a highly trained man competing against a highly trained women  why would be expect the woman to win -- we wouldn t.  thats why there are so many articles recently about  trans-men  to be excluding the women s sporting events.strong men want to be with strong women  and to be clear  bullies are weak men and cowards.  so yes these are just stories  and yes they are fantasy  but good writing gives a touch of reality to hook us.  its thatsense of possibility that let us enjoy the stories.  crappy writing is self-evident because we dont read them.  my imagination isn t strong enough to see how marvel could produce something with this social bent worthy of my time.  but stupid people will probably go out in droves.  maybe its the stupid viewers marvel  and dc and hollywood  are counting on going forward.
congrats youre the shortlisted winner s of the ongoing playstation5 giveaway contest...
oh brilliant  just what we needed - a meaningless mantle.and here I was thinking t challa was worthy of his position through training and adversity.. but no  its all the herb suit vibranium  so anyone can do it...
@darren gordon-hill  the black panther thing has been passed down for generations so...
@spectra phantom  so we can get over chadwick then
Imean rirI is a shit character and I d be up for shurI doing that  originally I thought they were going to have morgan stark as a stand in for rirI and twitter bullied the actress! for whatever reason!
that is most weirdest panther habit with a hard-hat  what happened to all the nanotech  suits
the moment in end game when all the girl squad said  we ll take it from here  was a great moment but also a great reason to concern and we re seeing the results since end game.
thank you for amazing video!
no combination of rotten eggs will make an omelet.   cs lewis.
marvel gets on this one imo for sure  shurI was amazing in the first and already expected her to be a  sidekick  so to speak on bp2  the problem with the all the other  woke  men suck  marvel entertainment is it just sucks. its only a bad idea if itsucks.  there was push back for house of the dragon when they introduced black valyrians. was stated in the books that all valyrians were white with silver hair. they treated it very well tho and I think anyone who had bad vibes with it were quickly turned around in their views.  marvel needs to do this. I think mostly it comes down to writing  the current stuff put out from marvel has been terrible.
I dont want shurI to be the black panther  I realize she was the bp for a hot minute  but the mcu version is a scientist and not a warrior. if its okoye  that could be really cool  and when has   it not happening in the comics  stopped marvel before
they re trying to set up an  young avengers  with all these young  next gen characters. kate bishop  wanda s kids  ant-man s daughter in the new movie....young avengers is coming.
chadwick boseman will always be the black panther wakanda forever!
personally I dont have a problem with this.  I think thatshurI being black panther isnt bad and was a good choice all things considered.  as far as im concerned its not a matter of making her black panther just because she is a woman since she became black panther in the comics aswell  I think .  I would rather they had killmonger still alive and become bp but as long as its good its not an issue for me at least.
I have zero problems with a nubian princess in a cat...Imean panther suit  as long as the story is good.
Im really hoping this is going to be good but I doubt it
ms. marvel and she-hulk are what made me question the future about the mcu  and I want wakanda forever to be an amazing film  but because of the recent projects we have been given  Im very skeptical for this movie.
its possible given this did happen in the comics.
you cant replace chadwick he is the black panther. his sister was smart but she didn t know how to fight.
I adore letitia wright  as she is very open about her faith  something that takes extraordinary courage in hollywood. between that  and the fact that chadwick boseman passed away  Im willing to give this a chance  as I dont think that this is born out of woke politics  and just trying for them to deal with the situation that they ve been dealt by fate the best they can.
I doubt disney is truly doing this for any noble cause  however   this movie does look like its going to be one of the better films of phase 4  perhaps the only good one  so Im going to check it out.
the thumbnail really makes it look like melonie is thirsting over that cover
mel intersecting tomb raider into a video is like expecting a stan lee cameo in a marvel movie
the ancestors jumping off the ship line was too much now that killmonger is dead when he could ve been redeemed as bp makes that line even worse now
if it takes place during the blip  that explains t challa s death and how they can recast him after this film. Im going to give it a chance because of the director  and namor.
tbqh as a long time comic reader that was a fan of t challa long before most normie bandwagon fans even knew he existed  I find this kind of thinking ridiculous. chadwick boseman should no more always be t challa then heath ledger should always be the joker. those characters are too big to be defined by one actor. dont get me wrong  cancer sucks and its sad that chadwick boseman died but they should have recast t challa and made a real black panther 2 instead of this woke femcu bullshit.
@spider - cop I had a good  felt time spending time w  the khan family   community in ms. marvel. also we learned a little bit history about india   pakistan being controlled by the british empire.
ms marvel was great tho  she hulk not so much
smart move would of been recast and bring in a t challa from another universe or even bring back another killmonger who is good and steps in to become their protector till shurI could be trained. hell even making okoye the new bp would of made more sense given she can already fight and just have the suit enhancing her.
good point
if I was marvel  I would have this film set during the snapped years. address the recast or not issue in the third film
I feel michael jaI white would make a great new black panther.
yes it can work  come on... it was already done in the comics and it was awsome.
I thought namor mckenzie s father was captain leonard mckenzie  and he  namor   inadvertently freed captain america from ice after being angered by people worshiping idols   no
I ll be pissed if they call her  pantha  lol.dynamite would probably not let that happen anyways.
it might be good but its going to be difficult to fill chadwick boseman s shoes. much like if they got someone else to play wolverine beside hugh jackman.
my only issue with this movie is that disney seem to be back it again i.e  stealing  in this case the iron heart suit is a clear rip-off of kenichI sonoda s bubblegum crisis mechanical designs  the motoslave to be exact.
looking great. also fun video
2009 is not old its still new
ironheart s tv show  which will air on disney  sometime next year  solely purpose is to promote drag queens and their valuable lessons about grooming children.
for me the first movie ok at best and for what I see from this new trailer is that they are playing on the emotions of chadwick death as the first half of the trailer felt like that to me
we all knew it was gonna be shuri. I personally think okoye or nakia should ve been the new panther. shurI isn t old enough to carry this title yet.
shurI actually makes sense to take up the mantle  like you said through  marvel screwed her over with the past woke bs they pushed into the male mcu superheroes..
knowing disney  they will most likely force it to go woke.
I love your channel your always spot on information love your tattoos your beautiful new fan
while I dont like the character shurI  she has to tell us how she was smarter than bruce and tony after all. I do like the actress speaks her mind and not always the hollywood line. still wont spend a dime to she a marvel movie but glad to see she is getting a chance.
yes namor can fly now...
hImelonie congrats on 59k thoughts on the video game days gone on ps4
I actually have faith this will be good.
I ll watch if michael b jordan comes back and plays black panther. its marvel so they can easily make it where he doesnt die or use the multiverse.
I would argue replacing jackman as wolverine would be harder due to him playing the character for decades vs chadwick who had a single solo movie and a few side movie appearances. I think chadwick did an amazing job but they should of recast and possibly brought in another t challa from an alternate universe since they introduced the multiverse already. even bringing back  killmonger for a redemption arc could of been good.
overrated. he does a good job but that is it.. it is not like such classic acting in a big movie. all becasue he is black and suddenly it is like hard to fill his shoes.. blaj blah blah
thats the problem  though  they want that this female character actress to replace chadwick. or at least they want audiences to consider her as important as chadwick. its unreasonable.
@brad miles  your argument is correct but that doesnt stop disney to try making people think chadwick is more important. its not enough to replace chadwick with a male character as it does make sense plot wise and it lessens the impact of the change  they have to blow the change out of proportion  cant wait for the next film.just like 007  they wanted a female black bond  a character who s main characteristic is being seductive and get the girl. it failed  so now they ve  settled  for a male black bond because  society yadda yadda yadda I can cry about it .
@asia stormy  my asian nigga!!!!they just ignore wesley snipes as blade cos  new shiny toy !!never in my life seen  so many  blacks gaf about comics - lost my  black card  aged 8 in the mid 80s for liking comicsbut give racists a alien powered secluded super kingdom of their own and suddenly all kinds of walls need be build and national borders are important!! how can marvel even continue the mcu now chadwick s dead  let alone recast bp.... oh wait  bp is a girl now  wkanda forever!!!
or skilled enough.
the  blip  lol
it could actually work... as long as the writers do a good job.
Im ok with shurI being the new bp  as long as they dont write her too cheesy. as for iron heart  I dont know why she s even in this movie. apart from that  the trailer looks fine! Im willing to be open-minded with this movie  and I trust ryan coogler to be behind the wheel. I did enjoy the first movie he did and also creed.
jackie chan black panther  perfect
hope it good  the first is one of the best marvel studios had put out. itstill sad we lost chadwick too soon from cancer.
this is a hard pass. when shurI was bp thcalla became king of the dead and one of the leaders of the illuminati.
its a marvel movie in 2022 - how is this not going to be woke   also  that thumbnail looks like melonie is giving shurI the  male gaze.   she s even biting her bottom lip.  meow.
wonder how they plan to explain his death
I dont wanna be that guy but the first black panther was a little woke. it wasn t over the top or horribly written but had some wokeness. and infinity war already had a  shurI is smarter than bruce banner  moment that was pretty ugh. that being said her black panther costume looks pretty solid and since she was black panther for a second in the comics I dont think its that bad of a choice to run with considering the situation. it has me more hyped than the dude playing namor who has a decent but not amazing physique lol
youre far more generous than I am.  disney is dead to me.  only problem is that its not buried deep enough  so itstill stinks.
trailer looks great I think this wont be a whole  she - hulk  situation wakanda forever
perfect example of recasting was the spartacus show on starz. tragically  the main actor who played spartacus died of cancer after season1.  they recast and the series went on to conclusion. sure it was odd the first few episodes of that 2nd season but overall a flawless transition. originally  they also did a prequel spinoff while the actor was fighting his cancer  but sadly he died.
Im fine with shurI taking the mantle  it happened in the comics and was done well imo. I like the casting for namor but I dont care for the mayan theme. it doesnt seem to fit the atlanteans imo. we ll see how I feel after I see it. no doubt this film will kill at the box office
more moon knight!!
its phase 4  hope is the catalyst for disappointment or however the saying does
wanda was pretty cool in multiverse
so they decide to have t challa die instead of haveing someone else play the part just because chad bozeman died. after Christopher reeve died they didn t just hang up the cape instead they had other actors play the part. dont get me wrong Im sorry the man died  but to refuse to  let some else play the black panther  t challa Imean  are they saying chadwick bozeman is more important then Christopher reeve  if I said Christopher reeve is more important then chadwick bozeman I d be called raciest but I would never say that cause no one life is more important then the other. get mad at me if you want call me a raciest if you want I really dont care Im just trying to prove a point.
yeah. but the shury character is not exactly the same on the comics. she was a great fighter. on the mcu the establish she wasn t so good. she was more a scientist. also  they recast thunderbolt ross pretty quicly
the m-she-u needs another thanos snap so it can be rebuilt. its insufferable at this point
I thought the first wasn t bad and even liked shuri. but after all the crap they have given us I dont have much hope also they ruined namor if they wanted a mayan there is another person that is actually mayan in the comics.
Im sure she ll be smarter and stronger than t challa in every way  where none of her struggles are due to her own character flaws but some men society oppressing her.
marvel studios    sounds like  straight to vhs  to me...
@darren gordon-hill  yeah phase 4 feels like straight to home video  lamo
@pokemonashgreen2  and a large portion - streaming services - is.except people have been conditioned into thinking they re getting  cinema at home  due to the  mcu affiliation marvel brand .its like how wwe has the  nxt  brand  but thats not exactly  monday night raw  but likely gets more attention due to  wwe logo ...that  black panther  is really small in comparison to  wakanda forever  eating up the screen.so dont be surprised if the ingredients read  contains 8  bp ...
@darren gordon-hill  and itsmart marketing
I dont know they already kind of mary sue d shurI in the first bp. they made her smarter then t challa which is not true to the comic given t challa is in the smartest 5 people in all of marvel. he is way more intelligent then shurI in the comic and makes all his own suits yet in the movie they had shurI improve his suits. having to nerf the main character of the franchise to make shurI look better is a total mary sue move. similar to what they did to hulk in the she-hulk show. shurI has no fighting ability so being bp makes no sense. if you make her entirely just tech based then why bring rirI in since you d just have the same character kind of copy and pasted into the film.
forreal  I want to be excited for this so bad Im just scared since marvel has burned us haha!
@brad miles  misogynist!the actress that plays shurI is amazing!!not enough so that those gushing even know her name but a black guy died  so  things.as I see it  chadwick left before marvel could ruin him.chris hemsworth wishes he d minecraft himself in real life before appearing in ghostbusters 2016 colonisersneakersforeveryone
if we think about it  its hard to put  woke  in wakanda unless it literally forced in there for no reason whatsoever. because of the setting and plot of black panther I have hope it will be a normal movie.
@ithamar lowe  you would think there s nothing woke to add in a story about a country made 100  of african people with a bunch of high tech thatstill resembles their  traditional  roots. but I wouldn t put it past disney  they ll find a way. rirI and namor are giveaways of what we could expect
@melonie mac go boom  sad part is we have to watch for the storyline

target painted  on both of us. the character properly should be larger than the actor who plays it. cheers!
lets be honest no one really knows or fares about ross
I believe that they should ve left the sequel alone in respect to chadwick boseman but hollywood is hollywood. I dont have much hope for it and disney anymore. I guess will have to wait and see but I will not watch it in the hurry.
seeing the namor the mariner finally on screen with little wings on his feet is the only interesting looking thing about this movie
gonna wait on reviews from trusted sources on this one. I am almost certain this one s gonna be ra ra whamen power.
a question  none of the media commenters I follow are talking about the sandman on netflix. no interest  not worth it  from what Ive seen itsuffers from a lot of the same woke alterations as she-hulk and rop and others.
I am going to eat some kerrygold butter now.  good day to you all.
feels like its made for woke people and women.  its literally like end game where all the women get to get together to protect spiderman because their maternal instinct kicked in
look forward to when they relates black panther 2   3. then I ll watch this one. I dont like it when they release out of order.
I have trust in the director. coogler has proven his worth before and I think he will again. plus most of the cast looks like they re game.
marvel is looking to set up young avengers with girl-hawkeye  girl-ironman  new  black widow   she-hulk  and maybe girl black panther. they also have ms. marvel and america chavez. not a good idea.  working with the most popular characters would be smart.
my favorite part of black panther was when snookie smooshed.
I didnt love black panther 1 but it was a solid movie. will watch wakanda forever like every mcu movie  too. comparing it to shehulk  it can only be better. xd
in the comics she does take the role as black panther. after all the woke shit.... we re going to feel uneasy but thats accurate on the comics
is there even a doubt what this will be
I dont mind shurI as black panther as it is reasonable for her to do so in the movie universe. I also hope the movie is good.but woke namor and ironheart are signs that diversity  and not story  are the focus  and that usually doesnt work out  cough  rings of power  cough .
one thing in its favour is that wakanda forever is not going to make shurI look good by endlessly dragging down t challa  like they did with hulk  thor and others.  yes  its going to be woke -- this is disney after all -- but with some good writing and competent execution  it might be all right  maybe even good.
anything can work if its written well
this was marvel s con from the get go since 2018 setup t challa then get rid of for the sequel and chadwick wasn t happy since this was his first outing. he knew the script beforehand and was asked about it while replying he s dead.
how did we go from kneeling infront of iron man for his sacrifice to roucndhouse kick them for existing is beyond mecause the sad truth is even if chadwick boseman was alive they would have replaced him anyway... look at thor like he id the only hero left from the big 3 in mcu but will all know whats coming in next thor movie
since we wont get t challa and storm in live action I feel as if they are gonna make storm lesbian and fall in love with shurI  if they make her lesbian as well .
as a african american male I really wish they would have recast the t challa character. r.i.p chadwick
true  it cant be worse than she hulk
if it follows the trend should be spelled woke kanda forever.
as with anything from marvel or disney Im skeptical until proven otherwise. we ve just been gaslighted and duped too many times by them.
truth be told  I didn t want to see this film  and may still decide to not support.  my only reason for going would be to at long last see namor brought to life  and I think its an amazing choice for them to go mayan with him  and should serve as interesting contrast to the wakandans.  say what you want  but him slowly touching down  and sitting on the throne within the mouth of a what has to be a great white is liquid gold.  that to me is the money shot of the trailer.  unfortunately  I think they re going to continue their trend of making strong male characters the villains.... i.e. erik killmonger and m baku   I know erik is a comicbook villain  but michael b. jordan s portrayal of him was over the top  hyper-masculine.  same with m baku  in fact the jabarI tribe were pretty much portrayed as unintelligent knuckle-draggers.   probably an unfortunate by-product of too much testosterone in their system!
looks good
I think your concerns are warranted. they have a tendency to insert intersectional politics into their shows and movies instead of telling a good story. however  I will not watch this simply because Im beyond being burned out on comic movies and shows. I think one show at a time and one movie every five or so years is more than enough. also  they could have recast the character with dignity and respect. I didn t know chadwick boseman  but from what Ive seen and read he seemed like a solid guy and I think it could have been a fitting tribute to bring in a new actor to carry on the legacy. they could have built it into the story. I wonder if they asked his family. regardless  Im bored with super hero movies.
I think this ll be a case where they make a good character who is female and not a character who s good because they re female
I got a bad feeling about this.... Im just not going to watch it and wait for it to get reviewed
considering that black panther passed away  it makes sence for the mantle to be passed on and the  2 face of the movie picking up the mantle makes since. if chadwick was still alive id consider it more agenda focused but given the circumstances it gets a pass from me. as for the rest of the movie idk lol. since the black panther was a legacy type of thing I think the comparison with tomb raider was a bad comparison.
Im sure she ll go by  the mighty black panther.
you look different than normal. super cute I was hoping imbaku or resurrected gold black panther  michael b jordan  would be the next protagonist.
at this point  a movie about the dramatic origins of soap would be more original. you could even have bacteria as the antagonist  but the true super villain would be hiding in your dirty corn hole
its interesting superman actors have died or been seriously injured and the answer wasn t no more superman  clark kent and in the comics he too was replaced more than once as well.  h.l passed away during filming and the answer wasn t no more joker. mcu recasted at least 3 times prior an no issues there. an r.i.p chadwick he was a great actor and will be missed but he didn t even tell marvel he was sick in the first place so would they have even chosen him if he did  but when he died unfortunately so does his character an right when his character was becoming one of the few headlining major cinema characters  heroes  like 007  batman etc  that black males could look up to.
I saw this trailer last night   it looked good but Im worried its going to be full of woke stuff  I sure hope Im wrong.
I have not really watched anything after endgame lol so I am so out of the loop
I knew shurI would be black panther since the first movie came out. unfortunately they had to speed up the process  but this just proves I was right and they already had it in mind.its not as bad as the other female versions tho because it isn t forced. chadwick is dead so what are you gonna do
shurI could potentially work but phase 4 has been crap after crap so I cant say I have an optimistic outlook for wakanda forever
yha there was a female black panther but only for certain moments if t chala wasn t around to protect wakanda is what I heard and read a little bit as I got the comic book of when he s sister becomes black panther. but she stepped down to become a scientist. or work with iron heart who admires tony stark. I know people say we hope she doesnt get a easy pass but I think people are mistaking how easy and good the wakanda technology is vs when tony has to do it from the ground under tools. then there s the brain power at that and when technology improves so does the human mind.
they could have brought back michael b. jordan as killmonger black panther and had shurI become queen. that way he d be the hero  but he d be working for her.
Im all for her taking over but didn t black panther have to fight killmonger without powers  does she not have to do that or was the story no one wanted to challenge her
personally  I have no problem with shurI taking up the mantle of black panther  as she was close to t challa  so it does make some sense for her to take the role.  unlike with thor  with t challa having died  there is a legitimate reason for needing a new black panther and shurI is as good a fit as anyone.  in the same way I would have no problem with  pepper  potts taking over the role of iron man  as we know from infinite war iI thatshe has a suit of armour  so there is an in-universe reason.for me  what it really comes down to  is how good the story is.
disagree  all heirs need to pass the rite of combat to become black panther. is shurI exempt from this  and if so  is it just because she s female
@johannes stephanus roos  facts. shurI in the comics was a warrior and even then the panther Gods turnt her away originally cause she was selfish. it wasnt until she risked her life without powers against morlun  that they blessed her
thank you! way less eye makeup these past few days  just needing a break from it haha!
I just want to add this is inclusive  and all your corn holes are dirty xd. the shame! the horror!
chadwick opted out of life to avoid the  thor  treatment!!rdj killed his character onscreen!!ruffalo  dying inside!!!!
this is a sad but very convenient coincidence. even if chadwick didn t pass away  they would assassinate the character anyway
my only issue is will they write it good and dont make it to woke
I despise pretty much everything from phase 4 thus far  but I am somewhat excited for this
imo I would havent  recast  I would create a panther core or guard where multiple are panthers so everyone is happy and its different.
its disrespectful to boseman to not  recast t challa.
if my memory serves me  is not the title of black panther normally handed down from father to son  it may be thatshurI is taking on the mantle in an unofficial capacity  for all I know  for the purposes of the movie s story. for me  sorry not sorry  but namor is not hispanic  and while maybe its an interesting idea  its not canon. regardless  this is marvel  and its still not getting my money because the damage is done  far as Im concerned. and I couldn t agree more with you about the assessment of female characters being shoehorned in and piggybacking off of established male characters--what s up with not creating original female characters that can stand on their own  btw  are those the japanese characters for  gojira  on your right bicep  miss melonie
I wouldn t want them to recast chad. its not like he only did one movie he was in about five over 8ish years  he was apart of the family.
I really want to give this movie the benefit of the doubt but its like dealing with an abusive ex. sometimes they change and become better people but by the time the change has occurred the damage has already been done. people have every right to be suspicious about this  frankly I think the studio should be allowed to crash and burn and then be reformed by non-wokies so that this cycle of garbage can finally end  wishful thinking on my part .
hey mmgb  what is the song that plays in the outro of your videos
well its not like there s a quality cgI chadwick boseman to mix with live actors.
those female bp were stunning.
I ll wait til its on netflix or whatever
I think you are open to being receptive because there is nothing left.
I  ll be the first to tell you that Im antI woke and anything else woke  but as someone who read the comics as a kid shurI ended up becoming the new black panther eventually. as a fan I wont have a problem with movie as long as it makes sense and stays true to comics. thats all I care about  it does not have to be 100  true to the comics  but at least to some degree and I ll be satisfied with it...
wasn t shurI supposed to become the white tigress
well in fairness its not mcu s fault this time that t challa is no longer bp and it was inevitable thatsomeone else had to take over. as for the replacement I think shurI is a reasonable choice and it happened in the comics  so I will discount this as an issue. everything else like writing  directing  cgI  acting will have to be taken into account to judge the movie.
mcu ratings have fallen to the point that only deadpool 3 can save this universe at this point.
if you think the movie sucks then read her run in the comics. I for one really enjoyed shurI s run as black panther in the comics
I think its time for a ginger black panther
lemme thirst for a second. this girl was literally hand built by the hands of the Gods and the world was blessed when you were born. . alright any way. Ive come to the point that I seriously force myself to  keep an open mind  with every new title coming out of disney. period. if not the majority is insufferable. I hold on to the hope that quality will loop around on the back end and save us all lol
looks properly diverse...
ironheart is in it   cuz she s so popular dr strange 2 is a good example of what to expect from this.
I dont know if Ive mentioned this on your channel before  but Im pretty much done with the mcu. I finished with spider-man  far from home   no way home. they ve completely lost me due to the flick scene in thor  which was unnecessary  and served no purpose but to humiliate the character.
they should have recasted imo. I understand they wanted to  respect  chadwick  but he was only acting as bp and its been mentioned his family and himself thatsomeone else can play as bp. plus its part of the movie business to recast characters and for marvel to say it was  too soon  seems kinda bs if u ask me because other movie projects have done that and even pushed back the movie too if they have to.the other thing too is how they gave being bp to someone else and ya it does fit with the comics to do that which is why Im not too upset about it and it being shurI isn t bad either due to it happening in the comics. however Im a bitskeptical because as far as we know she doesnt have any combat skills and if she become a mary sue then like ugh ok I guess. idk. the trailer was good for sure  but due to what s been happening Im a bit hesitant for it
I doubt very seriously that ryan will be doing the woke bs marvel is notorious for. even though marvel is insufferable with female characters I know they want this movie to be a financial success like the 1st one. I dont think they will chance having gender politics or other bs in it to avoid low audience scores. I bet it ll be very good.also I doubt they d chance disrespecting the most important man thats absent from the film who this film seems to be dedicated to  chadwick bozeman.
hopefully it good  but Im not holding my breath for that because I need a respond so much its not funny but do think you can make a good story if are willing to go their. but will they
I just feel indifference towards wakanda  forever. I dont dislike it  I simply dont care.
trailer looks good. but that doesnt always mean the movie will be good.
dc already messed up with aqua man. I think changing namor origin would make it fit better since the half bread atlantean story has already been told
shurI was always going to become black panther even if chadwick boseman was still alive  just obviously not this early. its not woke at all  shurI was always gonna become black panther
from the poster alone  even rocks cantell that this is just some woke strong-women movie.cant wait for the drinker to review it
I like shurI as black pantherbut iron heart nahhhhhhhhhhhhhno chance
legacy characters are never as good as the original. as a thought experiment if they took shurI and bonded her with a secret lion cult they could name her  golden lioness  and create a new character  while using the wakanda mythos and allowed her to grow as her own entity.  lazy.
Im just going to guess that the female version is going to be better in every way.
wandavision was meant to play into doctor strange 2 with strange coming to help out  which is why they act so buddy buddy. but then one of the people at marvel went  wait  we cant have a white male come tell a woman how her powers work. strip it out!
Im not holding out hope.
the is what woke hollywood doesnt understand  it works when its organic. michonne is a badass and we all love her  but its because she doesnt make her gender  race and oppression from evil  white  men a primary part of her identity. she s just a human and thats what makes a someone relatable.
I can pretty much guarantee crt will be all over this but I ll enjoy it anyway.
melonie  your new eye makeup style  whatever its called   ...its very... I like it okay.  its hot.
I actually want to see an all female avengers team movie  ... I want to see that train wreak.  all they re missing is a current female capt. murica to complete the roster.
facts
sums up my thoughts on the entire mcu
as for iron heart  I personally like the character  her argument was she s not a super popular character  and thats true  but neither were the guardians of the galaxy  and really go back about 18 years  iron man wasn t the most popular either  so to start the franchise off the back of iron man  instead of captain america  was a risk in its self. so I believe in marvel in this one
at first glance  I dont mind this.  men and women are included in the warrior culture in the wakanda story  like vikings  so at least its plausible.  I would rather see them flip it to her than to try to replace boseman  who we loved  with some dude in this case.
yeah  I hope it ll be decent  but the franchise has a chadwick boseman-sized hole in it.  plus Im rolling my eyes at the the aztec namor and atlantis  obviously to pander to latinos hispanics .  Im going to skip it though  like I have every post-endgame marvel movie- although I will see the latest spiderman when halloween is over.
woke-anda forever! lol
I think chadwick boseman was an amazing actor... but michael b jordan villain role made that movie for me...jmo
been done marvel  diddnt see the first one and wont watch this one. go
dont have a problem with female black panther what I do find strange is that namor looks like a myan  a people who lived in the mountains not near the ocean
so far Im pissed they didn t want to recast t challa tbh its a movie not a legacy  even chadwick s brother said recast because its more disrespectful to get money off a dead person s name. not only that the plot is going to be  shurI a female with no training only technology smarts is going to be a better king queen cause  gender isn t real apparently  than t challa because she s a girl... even though gender doesnt exist  also they re black so wakanda forever the minority is power shurI will have a girlfriend
its not going to be bad because of disney s obsession with pushing the narrative  its going to be bad because marvel dont have any good writers left.
I liked black panther  but it was kind of mid.  still not sure how I feel about wakanda forever or iron heart season 1 yet. Im hoping that disney decides to recast stark  rogers  t challa  black widow  x-men etc  because Im not willing to pay money to keep watching d tier superheroes movies.
yeah  I ll bey that this movie could do without rirI  but its common practice to introduce new characters in more popular titles in comics.
I think okoye is much more apt to take on the role of black panther. yes  I know shurI has taken the mantle in the comics but okeye is a much better pick in the movie because she s the most complex and possibly the best character to come out of the black panther franchise.  shurI was the least interesting part of the movie black panther.
Im just done giving disney my money. they ve ruined too much good shit to have any interest in rewarding them.
with marvel s recent output  I have no faith in this movie being good.
shuris actress survived a canceling for not getting vax. she s as woke as the rest of them and they tried to eat her anyway. hope it does well
it reminds me of health ledger s joker left literally hanging because he passed away unexpectedly before the next batman film.  the dark knight rises could have had the joker escape arkam at the end but just show him from behind ala like ben hur with Jesus type of thing only showing the character from the back.  this screams to me of batgirl or any other ip where instead of coming up with a new character marvel will just copy and paste.  come up with a female lead that is a mary sue good at everything out of the gate and belittles and humbles every male character throughout the whole movie.  hence not worth my time or money.  black panther was decent but nowhere near the greatest movie ever made which the rating seem to give it.  kind of like independance day where the hype was so big and the movie could never really live up to that.  where you go to see it and expect it to blow you away and its just average at best.
I think its the most legitimate girl-take-the-mantle character in marvel. bc actually everyone in wakanda cantake the mantle. so its can be done really easy done. and its really logic for shurI being the next king and black panter. unless its just some other girl not from wakanda that will be so wrong. female thor feel wrong bc how she take the hammer and the effect of the hammer are wrong. if its bc thor said it must save jane  why its actually killing her  ms. marvel feel wrong bc we never seen how famous cap. marvel in that univers and why. Imean she in modern era never seen by people fighting. she fight in war that Im sure no common people in it or I doubt any pers to. are the just make her famous after it just like in the boys  so its feel wrong thatsome girls being big fans. its lot s make sense if the girl being black widows fans or wandas fans. and about iron heart  how they make some girl get iron armor  is she make it  if she can  why army cant with all resources they had  why cant some bad guys  Imean  the only iron armor that bad guys had make is from ironman 1 and thatsome kind of stollen from tony. I think the only reasonable woman character cantake iron man s place is his wife. she had the resources  the had experience inside the armor  and she had real reason to do it. she want to continue her husband legacy of saving humanity. Imean it can be great story. we know almost all the time she against tony being hero  bun now tony gone  died in battle. maybe she finally fully understand why tony fight. or maybe she want to keen the world that tony saved with his life stay save. or maybe she want a save bright future wher their daughter can life. I ll love to see her as iron heart. and the name of iron heart will mean something. its bc the use iron armor bc her heart moving. its bc she had iron heart that put people upon everything else.  and we will see a strong female superhero that fear no shit  but still reasonable bc we know she always thinking twice. she always give tony advice about taking care of him self  now she has to do it to herself.
read the comics sparsely anyone who has would know a female black panther is canon. there s only one black panther movie for me. even though chadwick boseman was woke  in his performances he didn t throw it in your face. I respect him for that. right now all hollywoke is doing is trying to cash in on his death. I will not even be pirating this movie.
iron heart comic was cancelled due to low sales. ms. marvel comic was cancelled due to low sales and then rebooted to continue pushing the character. captain marvel had her comic cancelled multiple times due to low sales.
why is it that Im the only one who feels like bp just doesnt fit her character at all  she s more of a tech woman  the woman in the chair  etc. its going to be hard for me to see her as bp if thats really her. however  I understand thatshe had become bp in the comics. I just dont think it fits her mcu character. not saying thatshe cant train and become a good bp  I just dont think it fits the character that we saw.
the trailer screened before smile last night. might be interesting but after the abysmal thor  love   thunder I have zero desire to check out any more marvels in the cinema.
well after seeing the movie this is completely untrue
should ve been micheal b jordan
since marvel likes to turn their villains good  how about killmonger apologizes to the wakanda family   he can be end up being the new black panther.
I no longer expect anything good to come out of disney  the destroyer of worlds  nor  at this point do I care.  I have all of the pre-disney marvel stuff and watch it all the time.  anything disney produces is not in my personal marvel canon!
this is the one time where it makes sense for a female to take the mantle .cuz its canon. they re still going to fuck it up
if I wasn t already burned out on superhero movies  I would be looking forward to this movie. them having a female pick up the mantle of black panther does not bother me at all. people picking up the mantle of fallen superheroes was commonplace in the comics and it was good. this is a canonical situation where a female took over for a male superhero  so people crying woke already is preemptive  even if their concerns are justified by this point. I will keep my fingers crossed for the fandom even if I have no interest in anything marvel for the foreseeable future. I just hope the fandom does not inject political agenda into the movie if it turns out to be a legitimately good movie.
honestly I have one thing to say and it just I wish they didnt have scenes from other countries. I think there was bit in the trailer thats in america. and I wished they just ignored the rest of the world and focus purely on wakanda vs atlantis. I cant help but feel like the big bad reveal in the movie will be some white guy from america.
the thing is  it wont matter if it is good or bad. it really wont. because in many ways it will be a massive consumer bait and switch. we all understand why marvel is doing it. but it really wasn t the best option. they had a billion dollar property that was lazer focused at a previously untapped niche consumer. young black males. they saw the movie over and over. they bought all the toys  except the shurI figure... somebody probably should have paying attention to that   they wore the underoos and slept on the branded bedsheets. and with this movie marvel sets that consumer niche on fire. because even if the movie is good  its not going to sell any toys or underoos.
Im scared for black panther
the problem in wakanda forever ain t with surI . surI fits naturally to the storyline . the problem is with iron heart   a female   replacing another male superhero   iron man . iron man was supposed to be replaced by harley keener from iron man 3   an already established technical genius character as iron lad . he even was present during tony starks funeral in avengers endgame . the wole mcu now has overwhelming amount of female characters   most of them are replacement for previous male characters .  hulk - she hulkiron man - iron heart hawkeye - kate bishopthor - jane fosterlokI - sylvie female lokidr strange multiverse of madnessand many other original female characters.
marvel planned on replacing t challa as the black panther just before the first black panther movie dropped. the m-she-u was underway when they released captain marvel. kevin feige was embarrassed by the success of dc s wonder woman and realized marvel had no equivalent. he already wanted to replace marvels male heroes with female characters. chadwick bosman was not done with this. he felt it was unfair as the black panther character had just been introduced and was already being replaced. he threatened to walk away  his dying was just convient for marvel. so this was already going to happen.
Imean shurI does become the black panther in the comics idk how that can be considered woke
totally possible to make badass female characters  just not the way they re doing it...
it ll probably be an ok movie that ll get overhyped like the first.
this has been pointed out a gazillion times but the argument that it happened in the comics is faulty.    she took over being bp temporarily in the comics for like a couple of months.   it was never permanent.    and she made an absolute mess of things when she did.    but the larger problem is that the shurI in the the mcu and the shurI in the comics are only the same character in name only.    the mcu shurI was created to be a side character somewhat comic relief at best.   they basically took all the tech genius stuff from t challa and gave it to shuri.    they made her the  q  to t challa s  james bond .    that is not who shurI in the comics is.    she was trained as a warrior.   they are completely two different characters.   but anyways  rumor has it that they are just making multiple black panthers in wakanda forever so thats even worse.   this  anybody can wear the suit and be the hero  thing the mcu is doing which started with ironman 3 is trash.    hate it.
chadwick boseman specifically asked marvel to not memorialize his death and to recast another male actor to play as black panther. marvel needs to understand that its not alright to capitalize from someone s death like they are trying to do.  boycottwakandaforever
the thumbnail looks like melonie is biting her lip and checking someone out lol. did anyone else notice that
I agree with them moving on to a new black panther rather than recasting t challa  however  shurI is a terrible choice. idk if shurI was different in the comics  but the movie shurI doesnt make for a good black panther. no one wants an  annoying  snarky  super genius little sister  character for bp. okoye would be a much better choice for a female bp.
black panther 2  woman king forever
even if its accurate to the comics  I do not trust marvel at this point to make it good.
I agree with you on them using woke content as a shield for bad writing but this movie shows promise and I like the fact that it has shurI taking the mantle of black panther so it is comic accurate in that regard and I really hope it does well from a narrative standpoint and doesnt rely on being woke to be good and I totally understand the situation with chadwick boseman and I respect them for that and that alone for not recasting him after his death.
alot of woke stuff has happened in the comics tho.
no he didn t he didn t even tell anyone about his sickness. stop spreading false information. boycotting the movie for your own petty reasons is the most selfish thing ever
its not shurI  its madisynn.
my only problem with this movie is iron heart. no need for it. and my only complaint about the first bp movie was people advertising it as the first black superhero movie when there were movies like blade  meteor man  blank man  spawn  and more.
well this isn t permanent. there will be reboots and tv versions through the years. so it will be recast. chris reeve wasn t the original.
I cant support a film thats destroyed namor completely.
feige probably believes he bring life to dead comics who failed several reboots  captain marvel  miss marvel  iron heart  just to name a few.
wok e anda 4eva hopefully not
to be honest  these female characters could work......if they d just stick to the damn source material.  jane foster s mighty thor is a great storyline and she s a ferocious thor.   they turned her into a clown.shehulk  same thing.Im not sure why they re dragging iron heart into this  but fans who have read and have been waiting for namor all this time  are gonna be pissed.
she talk about bad taste so excited. she must be sadistic
I think that marvel should have cancelled this movie. I think the black panther franchise isn t going to be the same without chadwick boseman the same way 8 simple rules wasn t the same when john ritter died. I could be wrong  but I dont think this movie will resonate with audiences the same way the first one did.
do you know the total actual screen time combined that t challa has been on screen in the mcu is just over 1 hour think about that.   black panther is one of the premiere characters in the big events coming up and people are saying that it is ok to replace him after 1 hour total screen time.   where s the logic
can we just have one movie without someone calling it woke trash
saying their not recasting t challa out of  respect  to chadwick boseman is hypocritical. they were already talking about replacing him with sherI when was still alive and had only just been cast. how is that not disrespectful  also  they re recasting thunderbolt  so where is the  respect  for william hurt
mcu was dead to me after end game  so pretty apathetic about this movie.
having female characters can be a great thing. swapping race  sex and or personality of characters that already exist is unacceptable. since this seems to be a legit path the black panther character went through it could stand up on its own merit.
t challa s costume was really cool.  but it will only be perfect when it fits shuri. I think that t challa should have been recast  no question.  the mcu is bigger than one person  tragic as chadwick s death was.  I also think that heath ledger s joker should have been recast with a view to finding an actor to continue the characterisation that ledger had brought to the screen.  jared leto   tyler durden should have finished him off.
well just be a woke girl power movie.
the first black panther was woke  the character had to ask women permission to do anything.  the difference between it and something like she-hulk is better writing. getting good art isn t winning the culture war when the art is woke.
how low will the mcu   kevin feige can go

why - could it be worse than black panther. when I watched civil war I was very impressed with the black panther character. the little teasers of wakanda and the overall feeling I was getting. then - I saw the solo movie and couldn t believe the disrespect clothed in  comedy   and with dad gone  it was the matriarchy. fine  not for me. they even had to include a  token white person  which was a bit insulting. didn t care for the gangsta  vibes either. vibranium went from science to magic  ugh . marvel s dead anyways so this is all academic. I had my fill of the comic  era  and have moved on - good for others thatstill feel invested - you got more coming.
so  how do you feel about this film
you couldn t be more wrong about good expectations    only a couple actors are good  everything else is shit
2 things. 1. did they say how t challa died  because thats kinda important.2. i...dont really want to see shurI as black panther. comic shurI  maybe  I dont know anything about comic shurI  but mcu shurI is so sheltered  she doesnt know thatsneakers is a worldwide brand of shoe. having shurI go out in the black panther suit would be a disaster just because she has no context or experiences outside her culture and her lab. combine that with calling others  colonizers  and she is a walking pr nightmare wearing the suit of a central figure of her nation.shurI s a lab tech. thats what she knows. she doesnt know how to fight. she doesnt know how to talk to others. she s flippant and juvenile. yes  it would be sweet and heartfelt and mushy to see the sister take up her brother s mantel  but unless we watch her struggle immensely with that mantle  it doesnt mean anything. which  to be clear  I dont know if they will or will not let us see her fail at things... but  let s be honest here  they wont. disney wont show a woman failing at anything. so  ya. this is probably going to be problematic.I hope to be wrong  but how many times can we stick our hand in the fire thinking  this time ll be fine!
if it had been batman  superman  wonder woman  spiderman  007  or harry potter they would have recasted it. disrespectful ain t the word I d use to describe why they didn t replace chadwick. instead they casually killed off tchala in his own movie. I cant speak for everybody but no recast   no money from me
the marvel comics have also been rewritten with the gender swapping and woke agenda.  just because they have also rewritten the comics with it recently  this agenda is not new...its been ramping up for more than a decade  does not make it any better that they are replacing every male character they can in the movies tv series.  honestly itseems like they re-wrote the comics with this agenda as a platform to be able to justify rewriting the movies tv shows.  the main issue with the gender swap on black panther is because that was literally the one iconic black male role in marvel comics and they took advantage of boseman s death to get this gender swap in.  Im extremely skeptical that the reason they cited about not wanting to recast..was the actual reason for not immediately recasting the role...they were angling for this gender swap the whole time.
shurI is very likable character  also  while I never read newer versions of black panther comics  I hear thatshe becomes black panther herself.but honestly Im not sure thatshe s perfect fit for the title  because thats like if donatello became leader of tmnt after leo s passing idk  maybe she grows up in a leader during this movie  we shall see. I wish they recast t challa instead .
I would much rather see okoye as the black panther
both ironheart and shurI s bp run in the comics were flops. in shurI s case sales tanked and they rushed bringing back t challa.
I think these disney movies make people stupid. they think endgame isn t an original word.
never give the left the benefit of the doubt. never assume they have an iota of humanity in them.  they didnt recast tachala not because  it was too soon   they didnt recast him because chadwick was black. thats all there is to it.  they recast spiderman three times for no good reason at all  and the hulk twice  and you can bet they would recast others.  death wasnt even a variable.  race is the source of their respect.
I dont mind seeing a female black panther as long it is well written and well produced. but in that I am very skeptical because they are very bad at creating good well written stories that are entertaining.
sup she-dunkwhich pet will get cuddled today watch the while video to find out...
if you asked me my opinion 7 years ago. I would have been absolutely hyped to see this movie. however marvel absolutely has shown to be creatively bankrupt. I dont think the old talent is coming back. we hope every year its different where its our favorite gaming companies and so on. in the end I think these people lost the talent though. I ll stick check it out because there isn t much to get excited about otherwise  but I ain t gonna expect this movie to be anything to be hyped about.
thor 3 and 4 were garbage and so have most of the disney  shows but Im really hoping the writing for wakanda forever can overshadow some potential problems. especially since I d very much like this to be a honorable tribute to chadwick bozeman.
I think the issue people are having is this has completely turned into the msheu. all men heroes are being replaced by women. what men are left are either bad guys or they are weakened or made the brunt of jokes at the expense of trying to make the women look stronger.
went to see black panther with my brother from another mother  black donnie  long story . it was my first time seeing the film  while it was don s 2nd  and he really liked it.I thought it was okay. the last fight was very ps3 looking. don agreed with me. it doesnt hold up upon repeated viewings.
wokeanda whateva!
Im looking forward to the movie  except for ironheart. we dont need a replacement for tony.
ironheart comics are based off a japanese ironman porn parody movie.
valid points  but I have absolutely zero confidence disney could pull that off. I dont know about the comics run  any black panther fans please tell how well it went  but the mcu had been permanently stained with a bad reputationto me  having any positive expectations for this is pretty much a case of beaten wife  going back again and hoping for a change  especially knowing iron heart will be involved. also  didn t they  once again  change a character s origins with namor  the red flags are all therenot to say you cant be hyped about it  bit given the track record of disney handling their female leads I legit think this will be just as awful. if their incompetence doesnt botch it  the agenda will
ryan coogler is a amazing director  this movie going to be amazing.
shurI s stint as bp in the comics was very brief.  it didn t take long for them to sideline by having her put into a state of  living death  by thanos. even then  t challa was still black panther but instead of being king of wakanda  he took on a spiritual title as the  king of the dead .  on top of this  shurI in comics trained to become bp because she always wanted to be in that role.  she was a warrior. mcu shurI cant fight without a tech assist.
def gonna be woke trash
I like the black panther movie for its style and most of its actors  but its story was  at best  stapled together with duck tape  so to speak  and sometimes contradictory nonsense. much the same as with shang chi. but it rode the coat-tails of an aggressively racial marketing campaign  somewhat mirrored in the script itself  which fit the setting  to be fair  but which promoted rather than critiqued within the narrative . and hey  it worked  made a billion  dollars  props to marketing! but the film has a lot of problems at several levels  so I can only like it in a qualified way  alas. its too bad  because in theory I was pretty interested in a bp film  and wanted to see the cultural exploration as well as how they interpreted the techno-magic batman-ish character of t challa within thatsetting.  which the movie did sort of give us.  heck  I really like the mayan or aztec angle they re going with namor  whom Ive always been meh about as a character! -- Im much more interested to see what they do with that.
I am with yoiu
I have no interest in watching this until I see reviews. its a little too on the nose for me. chadwick was perfect for the roll. they should have made a movie honoring him and thats it. it will only have a chance if they give him respect and the new black panther is humble. if she s a self righteous twat  who things she s better because she s female. she will instantly be hated. another mistake here is if they dont do the character development correctly. I think the best choice for replacing black panther would have been the science chick in the first movies. that made all the tech
no absolutely not. its woke trash. for the singular reason that that is exclusively what marvel produces now. the fact that the logical and respectful series of events happens to line up perfectly with disney s playbook does not give them a pass for that playbook  it just gives them an ironclad defense for criticism. secondly the original movie was bordering on woke before they leaned into whole hog and third they just dont have any good writers.its disney. there is absolutely no reason to give them the benefit of the doubt. they have only earned the contempt of the audience since phase 4. dont give them any credit. make them earn it!
yo love and thunder was actually pretty good I thought but this man idk lol they have been fucking up
a woman became the black panther in the comic so Im willing to give this movie a chance...as long as it is a good story with a believable hero ark like the 1st wonder woman movie then I will support it...if bp2 is anything like captain marvel where  its just feminism wrapped into a hero thats over powered for no reason other than the fact its a woman hero  then I wont support it.
9 51 that picture though
as much as marvel loves race-swaps  they should have replaced chadwick boseman with henry cavill without changing any names or acknowledging that there had been alterations at all. to show how not-racist they are.
no issue with the opinions being shared here or anyone s coming from a place of common sense- however I have a huge issue with the term  woke . continuing to use this term to refer to almost everything is just offensive. here s why - as a person with a multI racial family history who identifies as a black woman  who had a corporate career  with a father who has been a conservative for as long as I can remember- I feel  using this term at nauseam gives a voice and an excuse for people to literally label one s existence as  woke . there have been times that Ive personally experienced my very presence in a meeting  in a room or situation making it  woke  when that term has nothing to do with me as a person. just something to consider about continuing to use this term from another perspective
didn t disney hijack chadwick s twitter just to spam the film  no way  f them! the main actress that plays shurI is based and likable  so the studio hates her.
when black panther came out  yeah sure  shurI could be the new black panther  but with how marvel has been aiming towards quantity over quality  and other than spider-man no way home  the quality of the other mcu movies shows has been utter shit   and the fact that the actress letitia wright was preaching about anti-vaccines at a very inappropriate time during the pandemic and retweeted an antivaccine video spreading misinformation about the vaccine. so yeah  Im not really thrilled for black panther wakanda forever .
you are the moment
doesnt the fact that when most the superheroes were men and all the  fans  were fine  yet when they flip it on its head with more women superheroes than men causes constant whining show who the real problem are  me  I d rather watch a chick in tights with powers than some dude. they re freaking comic book action movies.  it doesnt matter. far as black panther  chad was proud and said he wanted to see it go on  with his blessing. if he was fine with it  then its fine.
I dont care about black panther  he wasn t even known in my neck of eastern europe  but Ive watched those 60 s namor cartoons in the early 90 s on german cable  so I am vehemently against the new look. mayans were definitely not a seafaring culture and wearing feathered head dresses underwater is ridiculous. they re basically trying to repeat the insane zeitgeist of the first black panther  but with pre-columbian representation. its the woman king agenda all over again  but sneaky instead of idiotic.jason momoa could ve been the perfect namor  if you cut his hair  just look a him in baywatch  his facial features are 99  perfect and I dont even care about the brownwashing this time . but Im pretty sure warner hired him to fuck with disney  because aquaman is a blonde white man.
yeah I think that outfit could work on you.
funny they did a a female indiana jones with relic hunter and did a female zorro with queen of swords  both canadian in the 90s  and did it well. so it is possible but without the woke nonsense of today. but that is impossible today with all the woke bs
Ive seen breast in an smn suit  and the breast dont separate like that ever.
hopefully  the second black panther movie doesnt have those same garbage race targeted lines in it.  Im talking about comments like what shurI did with   your bringing another broken white boy here.   again  if a white person ever said anything like that  then there would be people loosing their minds  and crying out racism....like usual.for those of you that know nothing about namor in the comics  his father is a sea captain named leonard mckenzie  which the movie namor definitely doesnt look like a mckenzie.  his mother is an escaped atlantean princess  fen.  so who s background sounds a lot like namor   well to answer who came first....namor was published in 1939 and aquaman was in 1941.  but disney marvel was able to check another culture off on their superhero list  and of course they cant make new superheroes that are actually interesting and sell comics  so they took namor here and made him looking mayan.
tbh as much as this is comic accurate to shurI s arc. the first bp was woke trash so I dont expect this to be any different. its gonna be strong brave women. and I have a bad feeling in my gut that they re gonna paul walker tf outta this movie...
good points
sooooo could this be the beginning of the mcu marvel correcting their phase 4 trash    I will watch it and make my own assessment... hell  I couldn t endure two episodes of sh t-hulk and thor dumb and dumber made me throw-up for a week straight !
a female black panther has happened in the comics as far back as the 1970s  anyone that read the comics know that the mantel of black panther has been worn by many people  even the white wolf  bucky barnes a white man  has been the black panther in the comics...so it really isn t a woke issue for a reader of the comics...female thor ... again is a real character in the comics  the movie thor love and thunder sucked but having  her be thor and die of cancel brought on by the hammer is directly from the comics  again not a woke issue  it is an issue of foundation for the character and poor writing!
they using her to replace iron lad aka young nathaniel richards aka kang for young avengers which is dumb cuz kang vs young kang aka iron lad was a great story arc but u know woke culture ruin everything
the first one was garbage  set essentially in an ethno-state  which funnily enough puts them on the same page as the kkk   incredibly poorly written  badly acted  but benefiting greatly from the fear on the part of reviewers that if they dont applaud it that they ll be considered racist - dont expect the second one to be any better and given the state of movie making right now  expect it to find a way to be worse.critical drinker covered it far better than I can here  - https   www.youtube.com watch v 4qlvenxjk-s
black panther needs to be a white male female trans person! it needs more diversity. elliot page or something similar to be casted!
27 days til  halloween
first and foremost  Im anti-disney! I have no interest anything marvel since infinity wars and on the star wars side  since kenobi. the reasons why Im not seeing wakanda forever  1  iron heart. she s a made character in the comics that didn t sale well and was the result of sjw stuff. 2  how they re going to treat the character namor. he s a distinct character with an already fleshed out character arc and background. just leave well enough alone!!!! the moment I hear things like   reflect the world we live in today  I have no interest in it automatically! if this was shurI s story with the mourning and acknowledgement of t challa. that would be a far better story and many of us would get behind that! however  disney is going to disney and destroy another marvel character for the  message !
that thumbnail  my gurl s thirsty
honest question  is anyone not just done with marvel at this point  even if this is great  the maraschino cherry on top of the marvel legacy... does anyone even want a maraschino cherry atop a pile of dog crap as to black panther being good... no  it was ok  not good. but everyone was too scared to call it out over the climate at the time. the cgI was bad  the story was meh  and the world building was a level of silly that needed the rework that thanos got  a super advanced society of africans who were only advanced because they were mutated by a space rock is maybe forgivable  but that they still haven t figured out a better form of government than who punches hardest rules is ridiculous. further  the pandering was gross... hollywood doesnt get to say  this represents you . we decide what represents us. they wanted this to be roots. its a friggin cape show  not a cultural revolution.
itshould not be shuri. I get she is tchalla s sister but she is in no way shape or form a warrior. she s an amazing inventor and scientific mind but she s not a warrior. if they dont want to recast tchalla itshould be someone like okoye or nakia who have much more experience in battle. in my personal opinion I think they should recast tchalla  all do respect to chadwick boseman he was amazing  but I just dont believe in uprooting a character in a movie or tv show because the actor or actress sadly passed away. the same thing happened when heath ledger died during filming of the dark knight but instead of trying to recast they basically just acted like the character was just a bad memory. he wasn t even a talking point at all in the dark knight rises. just my personal opinion. rip chadwick boseman.
dude  if youre going to critique marvel...you should really spruce up on your knowledge of the characters.you keep pushing a woke agenda  as if these female characters have just recently been developed for a  woke agenda  the female characters  were originally...based on the female characters. shocking  I know.they have their own origin stories from years ago. this is not a new concept. these are not new characters. you watch things with hate goggles on. take them off. please. piggybacking is a normal culture of marvel characters. again  not a new concept. historically  this is what marvel does. itsounds like an audience problem  if they choose not to see it because there s already female characters that they like from marvel  or we re seeing the female version of male characters. these are new characters from marvel  that we are being introduced to. this would be called  trial and error. if it doesnt do well  we probably wont get more of it.also  lara croft is not called or known as  tomb raider ...she goes by laura croft. that analogy doesnt work.black panther is meant to be a passed down mantel. before t challa  his father was the black panther.marvel is very subtle with their woke agenda  but since you have hate goggles on  its all you hyper-focus on.we need a citation  that any of these marvel movies were written by writers with gender studies degrees. being homeschooled or living on a ranch is the  real life experience  we all need in order to make good content that just you like  maybe you should stick to video games.
fool me once shame on you  fool me 397 times shame on me. Im done giving marvel and disney my attention
I wasn t a fan of the first black panther movie. I loved black panther way more in civil war and infinity war but ryan coogler s movie is one of my least favourite mcu movies. wakanda forever looks really good though  I hope its solid.
well unfortunately our king died so I give them a pass on how they are recovering from this. marvel been making so much trash lately its hard to give them any wiggle room.
Im just done with anything marvel  have been since infinity war and anything disney have pushed out for the last ten years hasn t stayed with me like their older stuff its all become so cookie cutter and formulaic that I cant enjoy it anymore and just saying even if it was the original actors and characters I still wouldn t go because I just dont care anymore the mcu was a mistake and letting disney buy up as much as they have was terrible honestly I think its time for them to go just disappear entirely but thats just me
woke-anda
dont know if this crosses a line with you but .I thought angelina jolie was pretty spot  on casting for lara croft .
no tchalla no ticket
I have those black panther 1970s comics and sorry never had a woman black panther ever. female thor is irrelevant because it was a story point just to bring in the real thor who is and always been a man. thor as brief story points beta bill  jane foster  throg etc. are simple plot devices or brief entrances   exits on purpose.  if you make them other than male thor or male black panther as the norm you are destroying the comic cannon.
are the female characters being portayed as they are in the original stories  or are they making them overpowered compared to what they should be  the whole idea of a multiverse  putting all these characters into places they should not be  has ruined who these characters should be... male or female doesnt really matter  none of the characters are acting like they would if there was any attempt at using the history and lore of pre-disney marvel  letting the characters live in their own universes and on their own worlds.and female versions of male characters  just make a new female character  quit replacing things... just make a new thing...
@hadwell  ok so go make your new thing.every producer  director and writer for marvel movies tv shows  is heavily influenced by the comics. but we are seeing their artistic expression in these films tv shows. because they cant just plagiarize the comics. you need to understand artistic integrity  first.marvel has only gotten better since merging with disney. these are original characters. again  they have their own origin stories and marvel comics  created them...inspired by the male version. marvel comics  did this first. not the movies and not marvel disney.
@krs-1  there is absolutely no reason to swap genders or races or sexualities of any pre existing character from any franchise... they need to make a new character for that person  that fits that persons personality  write a good story for them  good dialog  and it ll be good... trying to force old things to fit new ways will never be as good as making new things designed to fit the new ways.should they just start swapping out all the female characters with males
@hadwell  when it comes to marvel  swapping gender race of characters is part of the history of marvel. marvel has been doing this from the beginning  as in  before the movies and tv shows.since the 70 s.
@krs-1  they didn t delete the male  they added the female... there was superman and superwomen  batman and batwoman... and  not or.
@hadwell  that is dc  not marvel.
@krs-1  I know  but those were the only 80 90s superhero movies I could remember without looking them up.
@hadwell  right  but wrong franchise. however we also had characters from dc heavily influenced from the male version. stargirl and starman for instance. we had wildcat the man and wildcat the woman. if you want a marvel character  captain marvel. she used to be miss marvel  replacing the original captain marvel  who was a man. she also was his sidekick as miss marvel. she became captain marvel  after his death.no one is being swapped in black panther.yourealize the original actor for black panther  died...right  how would you go about keeping the original character when he died. his mantel is being handed down to someone in the family  most likely his sister. just like the original black panther was his father.
she was the most perfect lara croft
@melonie mac go boom  ditto
hard pass for me on this not so much because of the controversy but I just never had interest in black panther in general.
it wont be woke from the bp side  they will inject it throught ironheart  make shurI weak as bp and ironheaet save the day by kicking namor s ass and be the best ironman evaaaaaa
youre dope
they shoulda brought back killmonger as black panther an still made zurI a black panther it would have worked
my goodness..
it ll be woke shit.
black panther woke forever
good points mel  but its disney writers so we know its gonna  suck.
this is fine shurI becomes black panther and its the suit not whom is in it. so your fine ayzz could be black panther
imagine the next avengers movie and just how trash it ll be. like ooo cant wait for the legendary team of ms. marvel  captain marvel  she hulk  female hawkeye  and just maybe spider man and dr. strange if men aren t too evil to put them in. oh and iron heart  yeah cus everyone is just dying to see an almost all female avengers team
all they had to do was have his unknown son show up or be found to take the throne tada new black panther!!!
race swap black panther please
Im a progressive and Im attracted to you. I hate it. ugh. supercute.
they should have just recast  you know marvel only has one agenda these days.
possibly good  I know some people can be very positive but come on...what about even worse than you can imagine   I bet on this option.
atlanta forever
youre title and just the fact you even have to ask make you part of the problem
the movie will be trash obviously but Im sure someone could make some action cuts that gives us a decent 5-10 minutes of movie.
honestly  I will be annoyed if its shurI  but if its nakia I wont be as annoyed but either way its still pretty annoying. they have like 2 or three options that are rubbish  one being one of those two beats the challenger and becomes black panther as tchalla did  realistically mbaku should challenge for it  this is bad because shurI or nakia are jot beating mbaku in a fight the second option is that nobody challenges her and this means she just becomes the black panther without a challenger which again is very annoying because this is what always happens with female characters is that they just dont have it as challenging as the men like for example what tchala had to overcome to become the black panther. also if its shirI I will be really pissed because that girl can not fight  we literally already know this and the black panther has and always will be one of the best fighters in any marvel universe
I am not happy with this idea if its a one off then I am ok we havent had enough stories of a male plack panther
wokanda
I will miss chadwick boseman
I see it being meh.
would it kill them to cast someone who fills the suit like the image in the thumbnail  can we have attractive women in movies  tv and video games again please
woke  maybecringe  more than likelyenjoyable  I hope sohotel  trivago dinner  idk my mom hasn t said yet
I have hopes I do but the markiting in magazines have been   the women rise up  and its not just shurI presented.. and that kinda sucks this shouldnt be all black womens movie this is shuris chance to show us what she can do.. but no gotta have a hivemind sisterhood instead of letting a character stand and rise on their own. at least thats what the marketing makes me think I could be wrong and I hope im wrong
no doubt it ll be woke af  they re black africans  its 2022  its disney mcu  female lead. cmon now we literally have to be crazy to think it wont be woke as hell lol not saying it cant be good but it ll be extremely woke.
m-she-u does not apply to this movie in the slightest lol rirI is a thing in the comics and if she didn t do good comic wise maybe they can make her likable live action and have a fanbase. shurI being black panther is a thing not something forced to promote woke agenda. they aren t belittling men as we can see since mbaku literally has many scenes already shown and was stated to have a bigger role this movie. I dont see this movie being another she hulk incident
when it comes to the current mcu we can be assured of this movie being woke  exploiting boseman s death  and them relying on the black community to shoot it up to a billion dollars in record time regardless of the quality. Ive long ago stopped paying for mcu product. most of it really rather sucks  at best its just okay. this may be a great movie  but I ll never know until it comes on d  and I watch it at the ex s house eventually.
considering they used his own social media account to promote  the film I dont think they give a shit about bosmin. I think they just saw it as an opportunity to get a female lead again. honestly I would have been fine with a recast of black panther. chadwick bosmin seemed like a nice guy but he was a very lacklustre black panther to me.
I ll skip it in the theaters. lately disney movies have sucked and were to woke. if they follow suit this will be a train wreck followed by  if you dont like it your racist and sexist  which will force people to say they  liked  it. maybe I ll check it out at redbox depending on reviews.  honestly Im not too interested.
most of me wants to just go watch it because black people are saying white people shouldn t see it lol
even if it is...f ing spectacular... who is gonna read it ! I read...everything.but  I do not have time for...another book. a sympathy buy...for 2 3 issues...but  man...12 books ...a month....
just glad this doesnt look like a comedy.
the only thing about this movie that Im not looking forward to is iron heart. Im tired of the all the unnecessary character replacements.
pass
damn youreally dont know anything thats going on  respectfully . young avengers are coming iron wars is coming so this is why iron heart is being introduced. shurI is black panther for a moment in the comics then tichalla returns probably in a recast or after secret wars which is a comic series that  re sets the entire marvel universe and is in the mcu line up. hope this helps
Im excited for namor however his piercings look a little silly.
to honor the og black panther would be to not make this movie or have a new black panther  thats my opinion  but I didn t care for the first movie.
im mexican  and I dont think aztec namor is right
fb lr!
what is marvel trying to prove by boring us to death. good job now wel all go outside and watch paint dry.
so they recasted superman several times despite the death of Christopher reeves. so basically we dont get another male black panther because the actor playing him died.  hard pass.
to be fair no one was ever asking for an iron man movie or a guardians of the galaxy movie either and look what happened. not saying the iron heart movie will be good or anything  it might be straight trash but you never know.
hulk replaced by she hulk  thor replaced by jane. ironman  dead replaced by iron heart. black panther  replaced by shurI  dr.strange movie was amer chavez wanda movie. loki. girl loki. you can keep going
it marvel so the female black panther will be martin freeman
I think I ll pass
I have feeling its still going to be a woke piece of trash unfortunately but I hope not rip chadwick boseman
I only clicked cause of the thumb nail
ya sorry  especially with everything marvel has been doing lately  black panther died with chadwick for me. you cannot recast him or replace him for me. not with any man  woman  black  or anyone else.marvel died around the same time for me as well.rip chadwick and rip marvel
not interested. when marvel and disney lose interest in the glory of wokedom  then Imight return.
do you know the sharing actress leticia wright is a Christian
I watched the trailer and found the ott emotion a cringe. chadwick boseman passing is sad but you d have thought Jesus had just been crucified by the way it was going on. this is clearly what they re playing on with the movie. its not for me. Ive never been a hug fan of action movies but the last thing I want to see is a bunch of grown men wetting their pants and especially over an actor they didn t even know
toy sales will be way down on bp merch. boys aren t buying shurI bp. disney keeps shrinking its male audience.  this one shrinks the black men demographic viewership.
you been paid luv
wouldn t watch it if you paid me
I wasn t even aware of  iron heart  being in this. we all know what that means now....misogyny and racissism is to blame when it does bomb.
I didn t like shurI to begin with so Im not thrilled with this. but it was going to happen one way or another. hopefully they can make a good movie. namor is not one of my favorites at all but gotta say the approach they re taking is kinda cool.
this is gonna suck  just like everything else marvel has done lately.
tho I respect the condolences. end of the day this is all acting and fiction  weird to mesh real life events with a fictional verse  and especially monetizing it
disney-marvel has jumped decades of storylines to get to these current female characters .......... I wonder why         disney disgusts me as they have ruined and are continuing to ruin the legacy of many of these characters in 2 franchises.  now we have logan back in the future deadpool but even if they treat these 2 characters well  I wouldn t expect them to reorganize their agendas in further movies.  Im out unless people I share common ground with say its decent.  disney is a betrayer of creatives.
wack-anda forever
I didn t know that  what a happy surprise
@melonie mac go boom  yeah she did some interview where she said that people tell her she needs to stop talking about Jesus and thatshe lets God choose her roles. pretty cool anyways have a great day and weekend
isn t the black panther mantle decided in trial by combat  a woman could beat every man in the tribe  really
wokanda
I dont want to see a movie starring shurI sue.
its  woke-kanda fo evah   namor  reveal   he looks horrible  and why the heck he s wearing so much jewelery
imma pass!
why would we think this is based on woke culture at all  I get marvel in general but this seems like pure respect   admoration for the original. female has never meant woke when it comes to wakanda
you know what a lot of little dudes who dont have dads are looking forward to  oh nevermind. again!
meh. I only watch it for namor.  p
so sad really. thats not the black panther   thats not namor the submariner. no actor is bigger than the characters they portray
the only reason this movie will be successful is from the lead actor passing away. the first movie was average at best.
danaI gurira and letitia wright are both conservative so fingers crossed.
marone!!!!!
dont know if its woke trash or not. but if it doesnt have t challa in it as the black panther  then Im not interested in it. he was the black panther for years in the comics  you mean to tell me he can only have one live-action film after all these years    disappointing.
there s a scammer responding to our comments  saying that we won a ps5. scammer alert
dont care  long past caring for anything disney is putting out.
shurI was the best part of black panther. but if they base this on the shurI comic it will be trash. and letitia wright got canceled  too  she s a Christian  and she said that  after the syphallis thing  black people shouldn t trust the government with the covid vacine . so this could go a number of ways.
I d like to see a white actor play the role.
female black panther... you mean catwoman
considering what they did since the first movie I wont even bother... why waste time. why encourage the trash marvel does  money is the only thing they understand. as for the question  when active marketing campaign starts you will have your answer. not a lot of trust considering the reason why they change character  this movie was written for boseman  for a male character. I doubt they changed entire movie.
I dont trust anything as of late when it comes to disney movie s besides spiderman the rest were terrible and spiderman man belongs to a another studio
why
@thatguywhodoesstuff14  no t challa
@thatguywhodoesstuff14  also I have not been interested in anything marvel since endgame....
yet cared enough to comment lol.
@thatguywhodoesstuff14  anything to show the downward spiral death by thousand cuts that disney is going though  yeah.
I feel like they should have just recast. but lets talk about how terrible namor looks.
not a stretch in lore to make this happen but they dont need to get into the man-bashing  feminist propaganda to make itso.
it was too soon to replace an actor so they replaced him with female - totally respectful... emmm  ok
black panther 1 masked subpar writing and fx behind good actors and black ppl pandering. at the end of the day  imo  they were as afraid of making a strong straight black male as they were of making a strong likeable woman. as a blk guy  im not holding my breath. the movie looks good but there s still a continued  erasure  of strong black men present in nearly every piece of media I consume  and wakanda forever is no different. worst fear is a love story where namor romances either shurI or ironheart. black panther didnt need a  recast  for this story. hes fully covered and disney has remade young mark hamill speak and act like a real person  they could have told this story without killing tchalla imagine master chiefs cameos in halo forward unto dawn . they aren t confident because they really are not looking to do the  culturally right  thing by either the female characters or the minority ones  and they will sacrifice the story begging to be told to stroke their ego and pacify us  women  minorities  fans etc  the good mcu were largely passion projects.these are parodies
I am in that boat.  lked  did not live  bp1.  but I will not be spending money in the theater until marvel stops with the woke nonsense and bad writing.  the only good movie since end game was a sony movie.  and I do not trust marvel no making this woke.
Ive read a few ironheart comics  and can confidently say her character is truly awful. its peak  woke  marvel comics. she s the bestest ever  but also a victim and everyone needs to feel sorry for her. yawn...
if it wasn t for the obvious shoehorning problem  I dont think I d be taking issue with it. but they just dont seem to be unable to stop themselves._they put frickin ironheat in the trailer_.why  what does ironheart have to do with the whole of the wakanda mess  zip. she s some regular tech genius from ny that made an ironman suit herself. okay great. put thatstuff in a regular avengers movie or something. stop with the message. it doesnt pay the bills  and drives away your customers.but the big d cant help it  they just have to try and push the envelope and cant refrain from just being a media company  they have to involve themselves actively in trying to shape society when society is mostly telling them to stfu and make content that just lets people enjoy the media without having to think about the way reality is screwed up.prediction  its going to be just as bad as we fear it might be.
Im gonna go with woke trash  the only good thing about this ryan coogler  kevin feige cantake credit for all that work crap.
yeah I wont be watching this one iron heart isn t even relevant.  if the iron man legacy was supposed to be handed down he shimmered handed down to neither his daughter or to the kid that helped him out.
this will be woke trash. 100  woke trash.
woke kanda. keep losing money.
does it matter when the mcu on the whole is just getting worse.
the black panther is chosen by ritual combat!!! there are 5 tribes  and nobody wants the throne.   mbaku just dose nothing  just let the girl have it.
this is woke and this will suck. it pisses me off as a white man due to the obvious racism. they recast william hurt with harrison ford but wont recast chadwick boseman. marvel wont get my money. btw black adam was kick ass!
this may be the first marvel film I will pass on. unless reviews are good. I have major doubts.
not excited at all for iron heart. more forced strong independent wahhmen.
marvel has gone to the dogs and I think shurI is an annoying character before this so Im going to give this a miss
I dont care about marvel  I am done with this woke shit.
are you from the east coast
as a black man I feel like this movie screams black male emasculation  feel like they should ve recasted the panther iam not gonna go see that movie
how
@thatguywhodoesstuff14  shill
lived all over from being an army brat  but I grew up mostly in upstate ny
its so bad we actually dont want marvel to do anything anymore becouse it may be woke crap
of course its woke trash. its mcu.
marvel is dead. sony needs to revoke the spider-man visitation rights and retain sole custody. finally put marvel out of its misery. wakanda wont save it  thor and dr. strange wont save it  and none of the life less  diverse  new  heroes  will save it.
dont be naive. the movie will be a joke. how many movies they need to ruin for you to learn that mcu is done
shurI being the new black panther is logical so that doesnt bother me. now as for will it be good  I dont know and dont particularly care anymore. endgame ended the mcu no more story to tell. even if its great even then the publics view on a female lead will have an effect on the box office. because of all the  strong  female characters destroying everything. female and male characters have been ruined because of the message. people will be put off because of another female lead. time will tel what it will be like and it will be judged then. will it make money  strong opening but I see it falling very quickly soon after. I thought the first black panther was ok nothing special. wasn t bad but wasn t that good either. the marketing around  black panther was genius and guilted people into going to see it. they wont get the same reaction again. marketing around black panther 2 has been very quiet  considering we are a month away from release. drop the woke it will have a chance  but if its woke then its in trouble. dr strange and thor 4 didn t do as well as they were hoping then to be. time will tell.
I got no interest in watching it.  I have gotten exhausted with super hero movies.  marvel isn t as good anymore after  endgame .
black panther is going to suck. even if dude wasn t dead they would have made him give his power to his sister.
black panther 2 is my only left hope for marvel bro if this movie is bad and woke bullshit Im officially done with the mcu phase 4 I ll just be watching older marvel movies
shurI become black panther in comics  so everything you saying and nonsense is the same
can it be good  yes.will it be good  nope.woke garbage. period.
lol at girls commenting in superhero movies.  thats too woke for me.  get out.
why do you and jeremy  quarterpounder  nambla pretend to be into comics and games  when y all are clearly not
possible good if they have replaced with another alpha male unfortunately they didn t so its trash compared to what it could have been.
given how insanely overrated the first black panther movie was  I am guessing this will be terrible as well.  and namor the mayan     what the...
its dead. no one is going to go a black panther movie where t challa is dead and they somehow dont have a replacement king. it makes no sense. why didn t namor attack wakanda after killmonger defeated t challa  and how did t challa die  did namor kill him  why does he has beef with wakanda to begin with  his people live underwater  they should be even more isolationist than wakanda was before t challa said  enough of that . and why are they aztec instead of their own culture leave it to disney to make a sequel to a movie  that disproved a lot of woke talking points  with a film that reaches new heights of woke nonsense. you rip them to shreds  they give you the finger and do even more of it.its dead.
im so sick of hollywoods woke agenda. how there always have to be a tough female and black person in every movie. so staged and fake and manipulative.
who cares either way honestly. Im not trying to be mean  but I just dont respect anyone who funds a company that actively feeds alphabet squad conditioning to children. let the company fail
Im cautiously optimistic but Im really not liking the m she u so far. not because its female lead but because disney absolutely sucks at writing women properly.
killmonger or mbaku other than that its a flop
yeah  Im never wasting my time on another marvel crapfest. never. they can go kick rocks.
maybe watch the move to see your questions answered. also how is this woke
the answers to those kinds of questions should be apparent already. for example  when age of ultron was being promoted  we could tell what he wanted and where he came from. same with thanos. namor is a big enough deal that this should be exciting instead of confusing.and its woke because they killed off chadwick s character and replaced him with his sister  as well as replaced tony stark with a woman. not to mention turned namor into an aztec for  representation  instead of respect for the source material and common decency. dont lie and tell me you dont notice the obvious pattern.
another marvel movie that will fail  cant have wakanda with out black panther and why would it be disrespectful to recast him if a real king or queen die there s a new one straight away....this is a chick flick it will be woke trash and I dont know a single guy that wants to see this.
I will cautiously watch this one  hoping that the namor   serpent God elements overpower the gender swap crap mcu is known for. every mcu film since endgame had a dumb as hell plot  told by idiots. last one  love   thunder  is a dumpster fire. fingers crossed. marvel is dead
iron hearth is the most lame character ever .
I ain t watching anything marvel . they ve already destroyed the entire franchise after all the trash they put out
soon to much female movies or tv shows it would be ideal if they havent too forced feminism  on it but hey at least men could give their opinion right
they tried a female black panther in comics. it didn t last.   and mexican knock-off namor pisses me off royally. pun intended
no melonie this will be woke trash. bp wakanda forever is going to be a good ass sequel to pay homage to late chadwick boseman.
why are you people listening to this chick she has no idea what she is talking about shurI was black panther in comics for years. she actually take up the title multiply times she was trained and went to meet the panther God the whole deal in comics. she became queen and she has a history with namor she fought him when she was blackpanther. she also was the one who destroyed is kingdom in retaliation for him flooding wakanda when he was possesed by the phoenix force. during xmen vs avengers I am starting to realize that a bunch of these people talking about these movies do not actually know anything about comics.
notice how in this movie diversity wasn t a big deal. why  because diversity only matters when white men need to be replaced. 15th century england  black queen. vikings  black queen. but wakanda  all black. ask yourself why they only want diversity or for things to represent the modern world when white men are involved. black culture  great! asian culture  awesome. white culture  racist. why is almost every new movie a  remake  involving replacing white men  could it be to try to hopefully replace white men by pretending they didn t contribute to society in any meaningful way  like white men didn t build the world we live in right  thats what I think it is a power grab by white women.
they should just have recasted the character  female black panther is a trash comic run and mcu shurI is insufferable.
wakanda shit is this !
yeah the sequel is looking like it is definitely woke feminist trash and Im not gonna see it.  the first one was just ok but not great.  boseman made the first movie better  even if it was overall lackluster  so too bad they aren t re-casting the t challa character.
first movie was extremely overrated and unrealistic.  along with the obvious ridiculous notion of a racial terrorist trying to control a racebent ww2 germany to control the world for the superior race being  right .this one is gonna be more woke by adding in the gender replacements.
nobody asked for iron heart tho. marvel 2.0 was trash af.
I expect alot of white people bashing in this
saying it now...its gonna be woke feminist garbage.
the movie was garbage.   story  plot  acting.   fx was good.  but yeah.   meh   I was bored most of the movie.
I envy those of you who still give a shit about this universe enough to watch its content. I cant. disney completely ruined it for me. star wars too.
since everyone wants to change race or gender for popular characters  why not a white person to play black panther   replace lara croft with larry croft.
spoiler  it will garbage like everything else in the mcu
you definitely didn t watch my video because I showed pictures of shurI as black panther from the comics in this video
nice one!
high probability of that given outside of namor notice they really didn t show a single male character.
you do not know that.
@thatguywhodoesstuff14  it only takes the slightest bit of imagination and common sense to work out...
first black panther had a good first 2 acts 3rd act was garbage
they destroyed thor dont care about this racist movie
probably the movie is going to be woke trash. these idiots should have hired idris alba to take the place of chadwick boseman who passed away. instead they put a woman in his place. black panther cannot be a woman period.
this is gonna be garbage. you just wasted your time talking about this.
garbage. an insult to longtime fans of black panther and namor.
I dont want to hate on this  but it looks bad.  the visual effects  in particular  are trash.  no amount of tribal music and generic rap cantrick my eyes or mind  into believing this is going to be anything more than forgettable at best.
black panther was a poorly written bad acted pile of trash what are you talking about
marvels garbage
im sorry but black panther was one of the most boring movies  I watched
