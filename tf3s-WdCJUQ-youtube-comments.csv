cage doesnt strictly view acting or movies as business. he has a romanticized vision of it being art in which thatshould take president over earnings. makes perfect sense why he doesnt see eye to eye with disney.
him and mel gibson need to get together and start making movies. also  id be interested in a raising arizona sequel.
I find nicolas cage to be an entertaining and charismatic actor - he improves  although some of the shows Ive not heard of!  the movies he s in and boosts ratings in the same way that the rock and chris pratt do  even when the scripts are less than riveting.  I am grateful to him for producing the dresden files series  without the show I wouldn t have known about the books by j. butcher.  it is incredibly easy to go through money - especially if you ve never had it before  so it doesnt feel right to me  judging him for his lifestyle.disney certainly has gone downhill  especially in the last decade - this morning I watched a video from jeremy at the quartering covering a letter from the  not on the woke train  more conservative staff members at disney  they re not thrilled with the direction of the house of mouse.  I d love to see these giant corporations stop with the virtue signaling and get back to making good quality entertainment  they might just make a profit for a change.
why dont they live more humbly   - yes! I dont get celebs squandering fortunes. props to him though for doing what it took to dig himself out of the hole he created for himself.props to you as well for not just dunking on disney. adjusting fire real-time makes this channel authentic.
pig is genuinely a great movie. really worth watching. the five nights at freddies styled movie is decent simply because of how wierd it is  and how he stops beating the crap out of the robot to drink some sort of energy drink.
he s just salty that they wouldn t let him keep the declaration of independence.
this is a good take. I like dunking on disney every chance I get  but they dont owe cage a living. I personally wish he would star in a lot more big budget movies because I think he s very entertaining  but this is a bit of a peek behind the curtain of hollywood and how an actor with a good track record despite a few flops feels he s entitled to a  20 million dollar paycheck from his colleagues  for every project.
I think it is unfair to say he squandered it.  regular people make bad financial decisions all the time  amplify that to movie stars financial scope.  100 000 would ruin most regular people 100 000 000 ruins most rich people.  but I guess it depends on how he lost his money really.  good on him for grinding to come out from under the debt.  I bet his next fortune will be very secure after this lesson.
thank you for this verse of the day section. it was like a gut punch to me - one that I really needed. know that you are making a real difference  and a lasting difference at that.
melonie  angry joe wears the same jacket and a superman t-shirt in his videos  so if you are worried about being caught wearing the same outfit twice in consecutive videos  just throw on a light blue top  some brown shorts  and little circular sunglasses  and we ll all just think youre cosplaying as lara croft in every video.
pig showcases various levels of depression  desperation and is well worth the watch.
good on you to be able to pivot from your initial feeling on something.  so many people cant change their minds even when they get new info on something.  nicolas cage should probably look for a new agent and financial advisor  but at this point its probably too late.
mandy  was a great recent film starring cage.if you enjoy crazy and visually artistic movies with a dread-filled feeling  as I do  its worth checking out.  one of those movies which is a perfect fit for nic cage s nuttier acting extremes.  not for everyone but its definitely an experience.
we love a good disney diss
vampire s kiss was his best role  about a dude who thinks he s turning into a vampire  and maybe he is!
the episode of the community where abed studies nicolas cage is one of the funniest things Ive ever seen.
nicolas cage continues to be my favorite actor  his batshit crazy acting is amazing and he s based  respect.
melonie  could you please consider doing a reaction video for the new daily wire  jeremy s razors  commercial  its quite possibly the greatest commercial Ive ever seen. I genuinely believe you will absolutely love it. I d love to see your reaction and hear your thoughts. be careful though  watching it increased my testosterone production by 1000 .
cage makes a good argument about disney not hiring him since disney did not have a problem telling j.d. to  kick rocks .
nicolas cage was the best batman without even actually playing batman.
mel gibson is a legend.
raising in arizona is a really good funny movie it had me lmao especially the shootout at the supermarket over some baby diapers  my dad told me about this movie for years and I didn t sit down and watch it until last year.
I agree with you josh  kudos to mr. cage for paying off all his debts  I bet many others would have filed bankruptcy in his place.
he was buying castles lol
@purefoldnz  cool!  -
@purefoldnz   dream big I guess
@josh the homesteader  he bought two bahamian islands  a pyramid tombstone  . shrunken pymgy heads   two european castles   15 estates  an octopus and a shark. and no Im not making this up lol
@purefoldnz  thatsounds like the most nick cage  thing a person could do
@josh the homesteader  must have been difficult to get a refund on an octopus.
@purefoldnz  dude I want a pet octopus lol
I gonna comment the same to spam her xd
she s soo cute in her sweats and tanktop and tattoos...Im not simping...
just saw you on fnt and you were great.   it was great hearing you are carnivore as well.    I was keto for a while but Im 100  carnivore now and absolutely love it.   its literally saving my life and such an easy way to eat and get healthy!     you got a new sub!
good on him. he s a good actor.
the reason Im wearing the same outfit two videos in a row is I pre-recorded this.  melonie... its us...
nick cage had the notion of business beaten out of him by his own actions. he went from superstar with endless cash to a bottomless pit of debt  dozens of properties he couldn t afford  all of them lost to him. hundreds of millions in assets seized by banks . he had to make movies by any means he could to pay off the debts. and somewhere in the middle of all that... he seems to have fallen in love with acting. legitimately. most of his movies are God-awful  but entertaining. some of them are legitimately great  pig is one example  though I wouldn t call it a fun movie . and some are just him playing a bruce willis-style cameo where he shows up for like 4 hours to film stock footage that the movie producers can splice into the story somewhere.in any case  if nick tells disney to fuck off  in any way  thats because disney is out of their minds  not nick. he s a consummate actor. he wants to work. if a man like that  a true professional  is telling you  the biggest production company on the globe  that ya done fucked up  well  ya done fucked up. disney is a joke at this point.
I hope nicholas cage gets back in some good movies again. hollywood needs all the help it can.
pig is an awesome movie. it takes you all over the place and you dont know where its going to end up. worth watching.
I listened to a two hour interview with him on the adam carolla show last year. he didn t seem crazy at all. seemed like a decent dude. anecdotal I know
this movie looks badass though  as a nick fan im glad hes turning his life around
there is just something about your overall enthusiasm that is catching.  just keep being you and embrace the faith.
I unironically love nicolas cage lol. willy s wonderland is a fun watch. bizarre  and definitely somewhat in the vein of fnaf  but not really a knockoff.
nic cage is awesome in most movies  and gives his all acting I think disney should have gave him opportunity to play in more movies
I cant imagine spending that kind of money  certainly not in the short amount of time he did. if I suddenly got hit with that kind of cash  I d like to get the house and cars fixed up  quit my day job so I could write full time  and that d be about it.
pig   mandy are really good. pig especially.. its a movie that reminds you that nicholas cage is a great actor and the story will really move you.
love your channel  keep up the good work
I absolutely love your takes.   I never understood the fascination with mansions.  literally a waste of space.
he did dis disney recently because he was offered a contract for voice work with pixar and he avoided them like the plague.   I think because of his experiences with ghost rider  he was done with marvel and disney because the production was a mess.
preach! it very much is his fault for squandering money and ppl very much are crazy to be in hollywood movies  especially for 43 years. nobody and Imean nobody owes anyone anything. if your big movies you star in ain t doing well then eventually you wont land big movie roles. simple as that. I still watch that uncut asmr nearly every day  lol  that will never not be hilarious.
glad he s out of debt  but  honestly  he needs to make more willy s wonderland movies. or something silly along those lines.
I feel like this was a very scenic globetrotting way of saying he wished he could have done one more national treasure movie. he beat around the entire amazon rain forest  forget about the bush.
mandy  pig  willys    color out of space are all great. also the unbearable weight of massive talent.
I think it originally was a fnaf script that got rejected so they tweaked it to avoid copyright and produced it as an indy film.  surprisingly good watch lol I love nick cage
just explain what the juice is in movie 2
by the by his new up coming movie looks wild and in the best possible way. cant wait
no company sponsor should pay attention to the twitter fruit loops.  they would find there would little or no impact to business  and that the twitter tiger has no teeth  but twitter is not the real world. btw  you distinguish yourself with the Bible verse. thanks for doing that!
I anticipate grander movies from nicolas cage. I still love him.
nick cage should get a job with daily wire working with gina. action movie extreme !
nothing wrong with wearing the same thing. you can wash it and put it back on everyday if you d like. its even a great idea in case you have regular paparazzI trying to follow you everywhere for photos  for years. xd
found you through your hatersand Im so glad their hate was good for something. God truly must have quite the sense of humor in that regard I think.
nicholas cage in season of the witch  amazing!
good for him  I saw somethign a few years ago saying he buys like really expensive and weird stuffs.  was funny af.
I hope you had a good family trip mel! enjoy!
pig and willie s wonderland are actually quite good.  cage is weird  but Ive liked most of his movies.  good for him.
Im pretty disappointed we re not getting a national treasure 3  but Im also glad because I know disney would screw it up.
I knew I liked nick cage for good reason
bow down to the cage man.I just cant hate him  he s crazy and I like it.
I remember hearing that the person in charges of his finances stole a lot of money from him maybe he was referring to himself .  but who knows if that is true.
miyagI said it best   you karate yes or you karate no  you karate maybe squish just like grape
when is his entire collection releasing with commentary
his accountant embezzled a lot of his money  so not all of his financial troubles are his fault  but on the other hand he has a dinosaur skull on display in his livingroom.
thank you for the biblical talk at the end of the videos. has made a big difference for me. has me seeking the Lord is this world of crazyness.
do you have any thoughts on the rachel anne zegler oscar situation  sense that proves you right about hollywood.
they get accountants that talk them into buying bigger and bigger properties to take advantage of tax loopholes.
hey great videoI had a video suggestion for you  I know this has nothing to do with politics woketards but I was wondering if you could make a video about your favorite game franchises. Ive only heard youreally talk about tomb raider so I was just curious. have a nice day melonie!
it wasnt released as  mandy  the movie was under  drive angry
not only we have a cultured youtuber here also cultured viewers xdyoungrippa videos are awesomethe issue with the money is either you see money and want moar money or you think you have money and nothing else matter youy feel untouchable... then reality and isr hit you hard  I dont remember who said  working to get money isnt bad  loving money is bad im glad he manage to pay his debts  specially using the money to help his mother  I hope he stays  humble  and dont go crazy expending the money like the old days
beautiful verse of the day....with thatsaid f@   disney!!!
willy s wonderland is a literal cringe masterpiece. in all seriousness  I highly recommend it. 8.5 10
the color of space is an awesome lovecraftian movie.
disney would be rolling in his cynic chamber
I would t worry about wearing the same outfit twice  Im sure most people are too fixated on the arms your bearing or the tomb raider manikin in the background.
pig was a great movie  one of his best
if I remember correctly cage had invested nearly all of his money with bernie madoff and subsequently lost everything when madoff s scheme collapsed.
the reason they live like that is many of them dont come from money  and suddenly they gain way more money then they know what to do with. some of them wisen up  but not all of them. its just like people who win the lottery - if youre playing the lottery youre probably not good with what little money you do have  and gaining all that money doesnt automatically suddenly make you good with money. in fact many people who win the lottery end off worse than before within 5 years.
I love brittany venti! xd so glad you guys are collabing now  3
I have recently soured on hollywood movies and actors. I just think that all of that money  fame and the things that they must do to keep their fancy lifestyles  changes people for the worse. as for nic cage s comment  I think he is just pissed that his connections turned out to be fair-weather friends. I didn t think I d defend disney  but I share your opinion on this  disney doesnt owe him any roles. as for him being crazy...he kinda does crazy things  he married 5 times  he is a workaholic and he named his son kal-el  he is a huge superman fan . he might not be a madman  but he certainly is a bit weird  which I guess is too much for his  friends  in the industry.have a nice time with your family!
willy s wonderland is amazing
if I had all that money  I d stay in my 1br apartment because its great here and money cannot replace the good people around me and in my life.
I heard a rumor about netflix casting hayley atwell for a new tomb raider. is that accurate  if so  what are your thoughts on the matter
just came from the quartering! love the channel and your content  keep up the great work fam!
check out prisoners of ghostland  really awesome movie he did recently.   its wild lol
nicolas cage is hollywood royalty   for his real last name is coppola -  as in francis ford coppola  his uncle.  thats why he has the attitude that he s entitled.
oh yeah! cage rage!
I would like to make some slight push back on the squandering bit. some of the debts came from things that were outside of his control. the rest I agree with however. placing blame is lame no matter who its toward.
no  that was kevin bacon and his wife.
the rock was my favorite nicholas cage movie. I was partially joking about brittany. people dont respond to being told they are wrong or going to hell. there are lots of ways to plant seeds that God can grow.
oh my goodness  I love the verse of the day! you have been a wonderful new youtube find  m lady! glad I subscribed. I read the Bible start to finish for the first time ever last year  and oh my goodness  the difference it makes with your walk with Jesus. its amazing.
actually he only half squandered it. his accountant actually stole allot of his fortune.
honestly some of the stories Ive heard of how he spent literally millions of dollars on bizarre useless shit kinda leans into him being incredibly foolish if not impulsive. but also willy s wonderland was a lot of fun. dumb. but in a fun way
I wonder what the masterminds behind kingdom hearts make of all this
willy s wonderland is good  better when you put doom soundtrack when he stares at willy s logo.
pig was awesome  lol. it was like pig wick
sounds more like he wants desperately to be back under disney s cozy umbrella...
nobody messes with ghost rider.
nick cage should get a job with daily wire and make a movie with gina!
it blows my mind how people can blow through that much money and end up being broke. I would honestly live modestly on that money  nice cars but not like lambos  a good size house but not a mansion or anything. put the rest away for bills and rainy days.
I love  the sorcerer s apprentice !I also like nick cage  but Im going to have to skip his new movie due to his co-star.
awesome about the movie! let us know how it is!
I hope you have a great visit with your family
hImelonie thats just fine your verybusy.its best to record as many showsif you can get them in.idk that he haddone that than again Im not surprised he had done that.I hope your enjoying the movie with your parents takecare melonie
day 21 commenting on your videos until g-fuel sponsors me. you broke 30k! Im so happy this channel is rocketing to the moon as itshould  3
willies wonderland was a fun movie its like a version of 5 nights at freddies. much better then the actual 5naf movie.
lol melonie I dont care what you wear Im here for your takes
good on nicholas cage paying off his debts without going through bankruptcy. as far as telling your friend about her beliefs  our faith is based on a personal relationship without father. we are invited and lead to this personal relationship through prayer  hearing the word  and wishing to emulate the actions of other believers. romans 10 17 states   consequently  faith comes from hearing the message  and the message is heard through the word about Christ.   finally  francis of assisI once said   preach Christ daily. sometimes  use words.
this is a great topic bc I like to watch disney bc they got an old cartoon shows that I grow up with when I was young kid but disney doesnt have to owe nicolas cage anything bc it is his money that he needs to use on living   taking care of his family and himself  ok. anyway I wish that he would stay with making movies that are good and not too boring movies to watch and fall asleep in  ok melonie. anyway that is what is I want to say bout this topic bout nicolas cage disses disney  ok. anyway hope you have a wonderful and great blessed evening at your parents house and have a good night and have great blessed week and weekend too  ok melonie.
dang thats rough
I actually really like the first ghost rider he did.
yeah. I wont pretend and say sorcerer s apprentice is the greatest movie ever. but felt it was ok watchable.
@lepke1979  I agree entirely  it isn t a masterpiece  but its a fun and entertaining romantic comedy with a sci-fI fantasy theme. it checks a lot of boxes and you can watch it with your kids.
well  well.. your powerlevel is rising. almost at 30k. kaio-boom x3!
now cage can start making good movies again.  this makes sense now why hes been playing in all these sucky movies.mandy was on netflix for a while.pig was a cool premise about a pig that rooted for magic mushrooms and it got stolen by a big drug dealer.color of space was a cool odd movie he did recently.
love willy s wonderland con air is my favorite nic cage movie
problem with cash savings is inflation. I hear right now usa has inflation breaking the records. expensive property serves as a  hard asset  which bypasses the inflation. that means as value of money decreases by inflation  value of  150m property  or whatever he has  will grow. thus if mr. cage gets in more serious trouble  he can sell his original  150m property for  200m because value of   has been reduced by the inflation.
video starts 1 22
huh  you can never contain the cage! I love nicolas cage  but he s an idiot for throwing away all that cash.
I wanted agree with him too but the he said he is fiscally irresponsible. but kudos to him for sacking up and paying it off. then he said he was working with pedro pascal. end of story
mandy is really fucking good. I also recommend red letter media  here on youtube  for reviews on his movies. good or bad.
saying he squandered his money is a bit of a mischaracterization here. his father passed away and he made some bad business deals. he probably let his dad read the fine print on things and it kept him away from risky deals  once his pops was gone  he had to handle the deal himself while still doing all the other things he did in a day. they didn t exactly elaborate what those deals were either. maybe he invested in theranos like a bunch of other celebrities only to lose their investments. it happens. they got sold on a good story and falsified reports. I have friends coming to me all the time asking to borrow money to help them set up a business. I always say no because Im not rich  but if I was making 20 million a job  I d be more inclined to help a brotha out  even if I knew it was a bad idea. better to spend it letting a buddy try and fail  preferably succeed  then to just horde it away. he also said he was paying 20k a month to keep his mom out of a mental hospital. if your mom had mental issues  would you just trust her health to some psych ward at a random hospital where she may or may not be getting proper care or if you had the money  would you lay it out there and get her really good care to come to her home and take care of her there in an environment she knows that isn t so hospital like and sanitized. I think we know the answer. do the math on that for context. 20k a month  after 4 years of care  youre in the hole by almost a million dollars. is thatsquandering your money  nah. money well spent. plus a mortgage on a multImillion dollar home  plus multImillions in taxes... not saying he deserves a payday  but at the same time  if the amount a studio is willing to pay is based on your last couple of roles  and the only roles they re offering are in films that are low budget  and then those films flop for a multitude of reasons  bad scripts  bad editing  lack of advertising  limited theater release  releasing the same weekend or a weekend ahead of a major blockbuster film that robs you of audience  etc.   thats not really his fault  the studio should be making better movies. the studio shouldn t be punishing the actor for their own missteps. you cant blame him for taking the roles either  he clearly would rather work than not work  so respect where its due.
not the bees!!
if I had 150 million dollars  I would want a few things. a decent plot of land close enough to civilization I could get a fiber internet connection  if not directly  then repeated to me  I should be able to bounce internet up to 5 miles over the air  or upwards 100 miles if I will use a land connection. from there I would get a big house  as in bigger than I would ever use want  just because new things come out and Imay want new things without getting rid of the old. imagine having a nice fire stove  but also say I want induction for when I want to be spot on with temperature. I want a walmart size building near or on property I could convert into a personal gym  or open it up as a commercial gym I use as a personal gym  a special room for my personal rack weights adjustable dumbbells  a large inner area where I either have an indoor bike and running track with a raised section for the entrance so people can get in without disturbing people who may be biking  running you can just wait till they are passed and continue  with a center area that is covered in nice artificial grass  and rubber mats for equipment areas. attached would be an olympic sized pool  not for everyone to go in and swim  but for exercise   possibly special times for diving if I even have that as a thing. for my home  I would want the living room to be home theatre like  either through a massive ass tv  100  inch  or through dimmable lights and a ballin ass projector  this would be sports movie room as well so good speakers. for my computer room  honestly it would be a bedroom  with a projector in it along with a roll up down partition. and a good computer rig. this would be where I spend 80   of my time  so probably 5-6 times bigger them my current room which would probably about the same size yourecord in. good speakers here  enough room to put out all my crap and not need to put it away. then we have the collection room  it would effectively serve as a library for books  movies  collectables... things I want to display. then a bathroom which is set up in a way I can pressure wash it clean. with a nice ass tub to relax in  a water proof resistant tv area  a shower that hits the whole body at once  a japanese style tub. a  degeneracy  room which I can lock with elaborate means  just to keep family out incase they come over  they dont need to know. then possibly personal race track  nothing too outlandish  just something I can have a bit of fun getting a car up to speed on and take come corners but used mostly for go karts  some holes for plastic inserts and and cloth plastic drapes to outline the track  and because its personal use I probably not need to think to hard on safety of other cars karts so it would mostly be for me. all the house would be made in a way that has each area separate from each other so I can get at the insolation or do sound proofing after the fact or rewire the room without ripping the inside appart  I have 150 million so size of the house is of no concern  I think once I parted everything I would dream of out it was something like 10-20 million dollars. realistically though I would have a house about as big as my parents and id be cool with that  my dream setup here is about 30k with a 1k yearly maintenance.
I think he s fair to feel betrayed that disney cancelled national treasure 3 and are leaving him out of the tv series- but dude def should have taken care of his money better.
I wonder if gfuel gave her a drink name and flavor I wonder what it would be and taste like lol
the reason most believers struggle is because they have their attention redirected towards themselves and we all get that abraham situation going where God s promise hasn t happened yet so we try by our own effort to produce the life that only God himself can produce in us. then we end up producing an ishmael and causing a lot of strife and bitterness until he brings us to an end of our natural strength  the true circumcision . as long as you think you are missing something this will be the cycle of your life but if you know youre complete in Christ and learn to rest in that then you ll have real peace and joy.
4 43  what  hehehe Imight watch that...a pig that gets kidnapped  hehehehe...  I know you probably dont smoke but that was the most stoner sounding thing I ever heard you say.
willy s wonderland was the worst Ive ever seen him in and he was barely in the movie. pig s plot sounds comical but it has a serious tone and wasn t that bad. at least he s not bruce willis tier and has someone read his lines through an ear piece but thats just speculation that he s developing dementia. I hope nc gets into better roles like he did with mandy.
like if you have 150 million dollars  just never go into debt - square away 50 million in dividend creating stocks - let s say that makes 4  dividend thats 2 million dollars of spending money a year - in dividends.  plus you own your mansion  your sports car  your yacht  your private security.and then maybe just sleep on a giant pile of money you have leftover.
the perfect girl doesnt exi-boom
9 09  tell your friends to obey your religion . thank you melanie for saying no. thats not the right way to change things. im atheist by skepticism and  scientificical  critical thinking and my best friend believes in astrology shit and spirituality new old  age hippiesism. Imay tell her why I dont believe it but I dont tell her what to believe or not. at best im slowly making her skeptical have critical thinking  and I could say that I have avoided her to become part of cults.ps  one argument I tell her  she s scorpio and naive and easy to believe  carl sagan was scorpio too but was an absolute skeptical and critical thinker.

nicolas cage dissed disney I though they are friend since they both broke
my top favorite ghost ryder
love the cage! hate the evil mouse!.
I guess its easy to rip and judge on people. the man made a mistake  and got himself out of it. but we cant celebrate people who are going good  can we  because they make millions of dollars it is just too easy to tear them down because we are not in their place. unfortunate. I thought some of us were better than that.
everybody dissing disney every since they bought out star wars and messed it up and hiding pedos in their work place.

they need a huge house because with 150 million dollars you end up with 100 million parasites coming to visit.
I agree if I had 150 million dollars I would be set and my kids will be set and so on have fun and reinvest and cant forget to build a fallout shelter
tomb raider games are massively reduced on steam this week
disney make the most safe blandness movies ever and Im tired of all this superhero nonsense nowadays  -
nice
he was host of the netflix series called  history of swear words  and he did a great job but after episode 1 it became extremely toxic towards straight people and men in general ... if you dont agree with me please watch episode about  dick  and episodes about  pussy  and  bitch you will see what Imean
melonie mac hot chick
lol rich people problems.
disney didn t just jump the shark they jumped an whole megalodon. when I was a small kid disney was winnie the pooh  mickey mouse and donald duck. now its woke propaganda. I was wanting to see an emperor palpatine movie but considering the direction disney has gone in I dont know.
dont care. done with hollywood forever. zero fox.
he is a terrible person
cat
astrology is wack lol
not to be mean in any way  I hope you take this as constructive criticism. but  this is a clearly uninformed reaction video about something you show you know very little about. I would suggest  you do a little bit more research in areas you are unfamiliar with before posting videos like this.
Im pagan  my church and Gods are everywhere  and I dont need a building to go to or a book to read. did you know that your God was once one of the pagan Gods
and he s a terrible actor he is a 1 trick pony. all these stars could never do what ronnie barker could do. for those who dont know who he is. british comic actor. youtube porridge 2 ronnie s open all hours. he totally dissappear into a roll.

thank you for being constructive! thats kind if my whole channel though  I react to stuff and share my impressions. I never claim to be an expert though  which is why I appreciate seeing the comments  d
@melonie mac go boom  ohh  Ive only watched your video game stuff  which you do seem knowledgeable at. so this was a bit of misunderstanding on my part itseems. nonetheless Im glad you took it as constructive  as sometimes Im meaner than I intend to be in comments. I will adjust my expectations  and please continue making the great content!
@jessie o   ...meaner than I intend to be... you sound like me after every time I start a comment war. later on I get tired of having to defend my statements over and over again and I realize I went too far and I have to apologize for being slightly toxic.
@audiogardenslave  lol  I just forget sometimes people dont take things the way I intended. I have actually never been in a comment war as once I notice things are getting heated I usually bow out. I prefer discussions over yelling matches.
@jessie o  I have discussions sometimes... they re just normally laced with tons of barely hidden sneers  prods  and demeaning zingers.

@melonie mac go boom  showing your bare tattooed skin isn t dressing modestly. how about this 1 timothy 2 11-15 king james version11 let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.12 but I suffer not a woman to teach  nor to usurp authority over the man  but to be in silence.13 for adam was first formed  then eve.14 and adam was not deceived  but the woman being deceived was in the transgression.15 notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing  if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety.
@melonie mac go boom   you had best get yourself a husband and obey him.ephesians 5 22-24 king james version22 wives  submit yourselves unto your own husbands  as unto the Lord.23 for the husband is the head of the wife  even as Christ is the head of the church  and he is the saviour of the body.24 therefore as the church is subject unto Christ  so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing. 1st peter 3 1-6 king james version  kjv 1 likewise  ye wives  be in subjection to your own husbands  that  if any obey not the word  they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives 2 while they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear.3 whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair  and of wearing of gold  or of putting on of apparel 4 but let it be the hidden man of the heart  in that which is not corruptible  even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit  which is in the sight of God of great price.5 for after this manner in the old time the holy women also  who trusted in God  adorned themselves  being in subjection unto their own husbands 6 even as sara obeyed abraham  calling him Lord  whose daughters ye are  as long as ye do well  and are not afraid with any amazement. genesis 3 16 king james version16 unto the woman he said  I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception  in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children  and thy desire shall be to thy husband  and he shall rule over thee. colossians 3 18 king james version18 wives  submit yourselves unto your own husbands  as it is fit in the Lord.1st corinthians 14 34-35 king james version34 let your women keep silence in the churches  for it is not permitted unto them to speak  but they are commanded to be under obedience as also saith the law.35 and if they will learn any thing  let them ask their husbands at home  for it is a shame for women to speak in the church. titus 2 3-5 king james version3 the aged women likewise  that they be in behaviour as becometh holiness  not false accusers  not given to much wine  teachers of good things 4 that they may teach the young women to be sober  to love their husbands  to love their children 5 to be discreet  chaste  keepers at home  good  obedient to their own husbands  that the word of God be not blasphemed.
