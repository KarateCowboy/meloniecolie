henry is literally the chillest dude ever. the dude wants no problems with anyone. why would you pick a fight with him
frosk  unattractive  bitter  angry  rude  degenerate  failure.henry   gina  attractive  kind  respectful  polite  successful.you decide.
not only did she attack henry cavill but she went after gina carano too. I would honestly love to see frosk actually say that to gina s face. enjoy irrelevancy frosk.
sir henry cavill  the defender of fans  protector of lore  leader of the alliance  custodes of the people  philosopher king of the nerds.
so dating a legal adult is not ok but they want to legalize grooming  Im so confused
imagine being grossed out that a 30  year old is dating a 19 year old but being a crusader for kids being on puberty blockers.
henry dating a 19 year old isn t an issue at all. I wouldn t even say leo dumping his girlfriends when they turn 25 isn t really an issue its just weird and makes any woman under 25 that dates him kind of stupid unless they are prepared to get dumped at 25.
just my 2 cents as a man  many women these days seem offended if a man they weren t already wanting attention from tries to talk to them at all - which eventually drives a lot of us to just stop trying. we already have that historic social pressure to  make the first move  so to speak  but when we re essentially slammed for not being psychic and already being able to read minds to know when a woman specifically seeks our attention before ever speaking a word to each other it really kills any motivation to try in the first place. then we get slammed for not trying. its a lose-lose situation.
frosk is just mad henry cavill wouldn t touch her with a ten foot pole. which is me being modest. lol
she s just jealous that he is manlier than she is.
the age of consent in england is 16  cavill and the girl he was seeing are both british citizens . if frosk bothered to do any research she would ve known its perfectly acceptable. but she s too busy trying to get any attention after destroying a company and putting hundreds of people out of work. she s done in the industry  she knows it and now desperation is setting in. what a sociopath !
frosk is about as  easy on the eyes  as radioactive sewage
I think the problem she has with the 19yo is that it wasn t a 14yo. thats more their type of relationship.
let s be honest  women like her are just mad  jealous that a women like gina could please henry way better then they ever could
I dont know anything about frosk but she seems like the kind of person who thinks making people dislike her is a personality
henry is cool as hell  he single handedly made witcher decent despite the writing team. gina  carano is awesome too. and so are you melonie. go melonie! seal claps
what gets me about the age gap thing is that itseemingly only ever applies to men. an older woman can date younger men all day and no one will question it.
she doesnt exist to be easy on the eyes for youshe exists to be grating on the ears for you
my parents are like 18 years apart. my dad actually taught her for a year or so in high school and  a couple of years later  was also one of her teachers in college. they started dating then  got married  and have been married for over 35 years. still together  still happy. I was raised with it  so  age gaps  were just never weird to me  as long as everybody involved is above the age of consent  and there s no other weirdness involved.
frosk better think twice about attacking gina... gina could break frosk over her knee  bane-style.but gina wouldn t do that. she s all class  not slime.
Imean its pretty obvious... they see him as superman  making them instantly superman villains
frosk just wants clout to make herself relevant....
@bffan221  thats why she s killer frosk.
@crimzon nova  please dont taint good supervillains by comparing them to whatever the fuck frosk is... but good joke btw!
sure he s chill but nobody s more chill than keanu
@mog dor  thats because he s the one .
for exactly that reason  have you never noticed how much it upsets them  woke mob  if you dont want to waste your energy arguing with them. parasites always need something to feed on.
the real answer is that he hasn t used his platform as a famous actor to signal himself as an  ally  to social justice related political agendas. thats all the reason people like frosk need designate him  problematic . once youremember these are the same kind of people who coined the phrase  silence is violence   their behaviour becomes a lot more predictable.its the same reason chris pratt gets so much hate  and why so much of his work outside of the marvel franchise gets critically panned. even the stuff thats half decent  that you d expect to score maybe 55-65  on rotten tomatoes  usually sits at about 30  because the approved critics all have a political vendetta against him.
@adam anderson  she s hoping so hard for a reply from him Im sure. if it gets a news article its win.
@adam anderson  exactly
I d date henry cavill before frosk and Im straight guy
@highbudget  that is funny I like that everything was good until she brung up the fact the section and gaming I can understand if she got her ass beat in resident evil but her speech is what destroyed her career
@highbudget  Im a  homophobe  but even Im a bit gay for henry.
woman doesnt even know how to write  frost  itsays a lot about her iq  if she has any
@highbudget  I would date henry cavill  before frosk or gina carano.
frosk looks like mgk
@highbudget  same here. frosk also seems incredibly unstable.
frosk is right on one thing oliva and morgan way more bankable and better on the eyes than ftosk
frosk is mad because he s a guy who chooses to date younger. he dates younger because he can lmao
@platinum bishop  she s just femcel who s angry that a high value man like henry would never glance at her direction nor even think of having a relationship with her. young or not - frosk is  not easy on the eyes  lmao
@crimzon nova  ....... nope. you. go sit in the back. go! no punny puns!
@robert mcdougall  I thought she was a lesbian tho
@platinum bishop  so she claims  but obsession says otherwise.
cause he wants no problems. so he s easy to attack
I can smell frosk approaching  itsmells like desperation and cat piss.
@crystal prelude  oooh dont be a snowflake and give me the cold shoulder
here s how henry cavil woos women...  hI Im henry cavil.  done!
same reason they pick fights with chris pratt. they hate strong  well-adjusted  masculine men.
@fran ji  not to mention killer frost is easy on the eyes while killer frosk is chillI in the eyes
@mrq12elve  one is cool the other is cold.
@mrq12elve  wish I could give more upvotes my dude!
@crimzon nova  one is hot  one is not...wait what   that backfired !! hahah
because henry is comic and game geek. they knew henry want shows and movie to be accurate as source material so they create rumours he is problematic
because lex luther in drag over here wants to bring down super man.
@robert mcdougall  she s married and a lesbian tho
@crimzon nova  cast her as livewire and let her do nothing but act like herself.
@mrq12elve  Im gonna need ice for that burn.
@valentine joseph  yet here she is obsessing over men and their relationship with young womenI too would turn  gay  if I weren t getting any from the opposite gender.
@robert mcdougall  its not because she s gay thatshe cant talk about men and their relationship. she s a feminist  thats the ish they do
@valentine joseph  well yeah that exactly the whole point - it is a modern feminist thing  femcels . I never at any point insinuated it was a gay thing. Im not questioning gays here... Im questioning her being  gay  here  because she seems so weirdly obsessed with men and their relationship with young woman.
@crimzon nova  ahum...bonerkiller frosk
@crimzon nova
twitter clout I guess
because until 5 minutes ago I was blissfully unaware who the frosk person was. people want to exist in public field of view  invited or not.
@bffan221  irl livewire
some people just exist to pick stupid meaningless fights  and frosk is one of them.
I would because he s too good looking its unfair. hahahaha just joking.
@hunter bidens plug  I thought jet lI was  the one !
I think the people who say frosk is unattractive are saying that because they see her personality  not just her body. she physically doesnt look bad but her personalty is disgusting.
rap battles of hollywood
@lawofimprobability  she dresses like a guy on top of that.
@highbudget  same dude.
@egert roos  that os. good question not sure
@sosoliquid  to watch youtube is only natural to be sitting on a chair while in a room while writing comments  what did u expect  sitting on a top of a mountain while doing it
@sosoliquid  it was a trolling comment of course some people just didnt get it  go figures
@highbudget  hahaha ..so true
@leonard taylor   d
you forgot henry is huggable as hell!
@lawofimprobability  she doesnt exactly help herself in the looks dept. maybe she could look decent.
frosk who
yep.
@highbudget  hahahahahaha!
frosk is 100  cringe.
