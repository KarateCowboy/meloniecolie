folk have got to understand that the people who whine about you having hot women are not fans or supporters of what youre doing  ever. its about keeping you under their thumb and nothing else. not to mention some of them are jealous  and youre not obliged to bend over backwards to their insecurities.also  I like how the word  sexist  is so devoid of meaning that having women in your game is as  sexist  as not having women in your game lol
I picked a woman to play lost ark due to how good they look and their dresses and outfits our so dam gorgeous. yeah they feel sensual and whats wrong with that  its not like im a creep or perv just because of that  I just enjoy the whole beauty cute vibe the world gives me and so the female characters in lost ark.screw wokies.
totally hear you on being in both masculine and feminine energy when youre single. Im a 36 year old single man  and doing everything myself all the time is exhausting  and being the masculine  protector provider type with no one to protect or provide for is really despairing. and the wokification of dating apps  social gatherings  church services  etc  itseems impossible to even know where to find someone  no less how to find them. ugh. great to see some un-woke gaming news content. I like to keep up with technology  because I find it fascinating  and gaming  because its art  which I love  but most gaming news videos and sites are like  why gaming needs more trans heroes.   notlikethis keep up the good work  I ll be watching when and where I can.  sweetbabygang
lol wokies is a good name. Im absolutely sick of those people complaining about literally everything. they even complained about aloy being skinny even thou they gave her a fat face in this game. there s a better chance of intergalactic travel across the impossible distance of a light year than actually appeasing wokes
I went to try lost ark after your last video on it and I fell in love with it especially after I realized it was a free download! I really liked it and got my husband to switch from new world to lost ark. and its our date night game while he s deployed. disappointed if they really change their dress up  I love my sexy outfits for my mage and female martial artist. thats really part of the thing I love about this game is the pretty graphics and cool designs  including clothing  males and females  they put a lot of detail into each outfit
foreign companies should not be apologizing for their product. they make the product for the fans!!! if youre not a fan or youre just a whiney  self-entitled player... dont buy the product!!! holy crap this world is going to hell in a hand basket. this ish is unbelievable. I love your coverage tho and I love listening to your perspective. nice to see a strong woman taking a stance against this ish. God bless you and keep you. boom!!!
for this ppl it is never enough. you fold one time you are done... p.s. love this shirt omg
I think the korean creators are just not used to the woke mob complains and they genuinely took it as a form of traditional criticism and spent time thinking it over  instead of doing what most normal people do - ignore and walk faster  like when you encounter the crazy lady on the street.
that is awesome that your dad is such a great father and its interesting to hear you talk about the dichotomy between the gender energies. I am a man and miss my father because he was a strong emotional pillar that helped anchor my more aggressive feelings. since he passed I have found that aggressive emotional relief by working out. I have a hard time finding such great manly energy in my peers as well  controlled manly energy. I know plenty of people who are extremely manly but are a bit unhinged. my father was someone who would stand there and take a beating physically and or emotionally without raising a hand and ask  do you feel better now  one of by brothers challenged him in every way and my father still loved him.
dont expect anything from smilegate  they have an awful reputation in their homeland  they will not only kneel to the mob  they will burn their own customers   there are  many coverages on yt itself  if your korean is up to the challenge  be my guest
lost ark has started the path to its own destruction.
the reason why many korean mmo has gender locked class isn t actually sexism  its so that they can introduce more variety in said class later as a content  if the male class is knight  the female one will soon launch under the name of valkyrie with slightly different ability for example   same as how there s no martial art class for male at the start  then they ll get introduced later .
haha thanks for the shoutout melonie!  youre awesome.  yes too many games hold your hand now  one of the reasons why elden ring is so good.  I love oldschool tomb raider  having to explore and discover where to go...figuring out jumping and switch item puzzles.  it d annoying in the newer games where all the ledges you have to grab are clearly marked with yellow paint or something.  take care  much love
I am a pastor  on my day off. I clicked the video  expecting an innocuous discussion of video game culture. then bam! you hit me with some really coherent and relevant biblical discussion. nicely handled  melanie. God bless you.
its kinda funny. I tend to tune out the bulk of the stories you cover because I simply dont have time to game enough to care about the latest publisher dev journo drama  plus Ive spent my entire life a console generation  or several  behind. however  my interest picks up when you start talking about the societal and cultural aspects of things  women being women  men being men  etc. also your comment reviews and scripture segments are awesome.basically I follow your channel for the second half of the videos and your fun personality.keep boomin  chica
excellent vod  mel! companies and game devs need to stop bending the knee to the select few. all bending the knee is gonna get them is less money   respect and a smaller audience player customer base. agreed with the whole men and women dynamics thing.
you are wise beyond your years melanie  so glad I subscribed to your channel. keep up the awesome work!
you bend the knee once   they ll take the whole mile. every. single. time.
hey melonie I absolutely love your fabulous chanel its wonderful seeing you putting your thoughts  opionsdaily. I also enjoy seeing that you putscriptures at the end of your episodes.takecare melonie
I had to come back after thinking of your speech at the end. Im the same age and single  also living alone. I know I appreciate having a feminine partner who can also take care of herself. I was in a long term relationship and it became miserable. I am in no rush and I do believe that we will eventually find that one person we can be happy with.
yeah  but y all need to understand they might as well bend the knee. 1. itshuts them up2. the players are still going to play. so why would they not just do it  ppl wont stand up  wont stop playing  wont make a point. hopefully this helps answer your question.
@irritatingtruth  except bending the knee doesnt shut them up  once you ve bent the knee once  they keep complaining about more and more stuff they claim is sexist racist homophobic etc. in your game franchise until you change so much that the game dies because the people playing it eventually leave... this does happen.
@irritatingtruth  only that they start looking for new stuff to complain about  they dont stop because the company bend their knee once.
Ive legitimately never heard players genuinely complain about having sexy clothes. but Ive often complained myself about the female characters only having access to sexy clothes  and not having equally skimpy wear for the male characters available. I dont think there s any problem with criticising a lack of options and wanting there to be more possibilities for customisation.
@sanguinaryblade  you can get skimpy clothes for male characters in rpgs mmorpgs  it depends on the male characters class  and in my experience the skimpy female clothes also tend to be exclusive to certain characters or classes.. for instance barbarian class men and women will tend to have skimpy armour  but mage wizard men and women will tend to be covered up  with maybe some cleavage showing on the women s dress .
@irritatingtruth  the moment a game panders to  sjw  side  whatever it means in context of the game  I tune out entirely. I dont have ion fury for a reason  I dont know if they ever ended up censoring the game or not  but the fact they were even considering bending the knee post launch made me never buy it  however I will likely get soon due to humble bundles fantastic way I can remove any cut from a developer would rather send more money to a charity than them at this point. the moment games pander to thatside  I know people who are sympathetic to the cause or easily manipulated are in charge  and the ideas they have are poison to fun.
brother if your complaining about clevage in a game your looking for attention and a 100percent they are the people that will play for a week and wont ever play again...and people like that dont deserve to be called journolist..when you complain about clevage we  know not to take you seriously
even if it was perverted it would still be completely morally fine
here here
same here dude...
I feel this one to the fullest. Im at the point now that I d just rather fly solo with how the world is.
I could turn satan into his holiest of angels again before I could please a wokie.
@gamestuh the return of toxicity part 2   what are you talking about  your comment makes no sense in response to the op comment or the comment above yours. can you elaborate
I sometimes call them wokesters
and calling them people requires massive quotation marks around  people.
well now their actions make more  relative  sense.
game developers should just make the content and games they want and the consumer can decide weather or not to purchase it. at the end of the day customers decide what to purchase not some twitter mob.
at this point of my life Ive started seeing sex appeal as just another weapon to be used. like getting into the mindset if you got the goods then flaunt it and if idiots aren t disciplined enough to not get distracted by it in a fight then thats ample opportunity to get in a free possibly decisive hit. of course that may be just me liking sex appeal and trying to defend it in my own warped way.
devs are going to lose time and player retention trying to score with kotaku and twitter. its a mistake  the journos are disingenuous and it probably wouldn t be a stretch to say these complainers hate the average gamer.
this reminds me of how when the latest mk game came out  they covered up all the women characters to that they show very little skin. then they commented saying that in reality no warrior woman would show off a lot of skin. my response to that was have they seen a fighting competition  short of a karate gI  women fighting attire shows off quite a bit of skin  referring to ufc fights I had also thought they were fixing a thing that wasn t broke as mk is usually called out for its gory violence and not so much on its sexy women.
Im really enjoying this channel.keep the scriptures going strong  Im very much enjoying your format. Ivery much appreciate you for your appreciation of a man.
this is the kind of channel the world needs. subbed
regarding the option for female warriors  a small research on the classes available in the korean version would ve shown anyone the existence of the lance master.
its not just the korean audience thats fine with it. as you demonstrate and most american gamers can agree we want normality. we want our men to be men and women to be women. its the wokies who want men to be women and women to be men.
man I remember playing pwI years ago  a chinese game that was ported to the west  and omg my wardrobe for my venomancer was pretty intense. there s only so many unique armors which are still basically the same...outfits are more fun.I also wish eastern anything didn t get so popular here. we rlly try to inject our dumb philosophies on others and its so irritating.
my main issue is this. the majority of players that play these games have never touched a real bobba in their life and can get some degree of satisfaction from a fantasy outlet without bothering anyone. yet there is a microscopic yet loud group that wants to control these people and deprive them of any sort of satisfaction because the small group dont even see the majority of players as human and deserving of human rights and common courtesy.
the number one rule is to never bend the knee to the wokies  not even once. that way you can continue doing your thing like most developers from japan are doing but once you give in to even one thing thats it. they taste the blood in the water and they wont stop demanding other things to be changed and the irony of it all its not even their own customer base they are appealing to  its the cat ladies on twitter.
Ive been playing lost ark  and after I started  I got rid of the default stuff and got really cool outfits for sakika  my female martial artist.  she needs her clothes to not be constricting in order to be able to do her moves.  she cant realistically wear some kind of heavy armor or tight tight leather that keeps her from doing a roundhouse kick.  I ll be interested to see how the subsequent armor looks if they re really going to make changes.  but then again  the game is very methodical and I find myself zoning out going from one task to the other and just clicking.  the bigger worry is going to have trouble keeping players unless they start releasing some dlc and expansions soon - because there are people that are already completely finished with the main quests  and then there s not much to do.
when mel walks into the room  wokies shit themselves
I just feel like sharing this...  I used to play guild wars 2. made a female warrior  used some ... sexy gear for her. and I have to say  it was admired by most everyone  guys and gals... and oh did we have women in the guild. the head of our guild was a woman  elder at that  she was late 40s I think then  she d be in her 50s now  she was the coolest guild leader ever and did she like seeing my character outfits in game...
on the subject of sexy outfits  I was watching a channel the other day where the guy modded the latest tomb raider trilogy to give lara more clothes to choose from.  interestingly  one of the  sexy lara  options was the original tomb raider 1 outfit. I told him that calling lara  sexy lara  for wearing her original outfit was like calling superman  strong superman  for doing the same  I played tr1 way back in 1997  which technically makes me a boomer .
well said. Ive only ever heard one other person talking about women manning up when they shouldn t have to and its good to reinforce that notion.
the talk of men masculinity reminded me of the story from genesis  27-29  about how jacob tricked isaac into giving him the blessing meant for esau.  if I remember correctly esau was a hunter while jacob was a gatherer. which because of that esau had it all  a wife and family and soon to have isaacs blessing  where as jacob had only his mothers love.  heck after he gets isaacs blessings and had to flee because it was found out what he did  he was tricked by.. I think it was an uncle  into marrying the uncles oldest daughter instead of the one he wanted to marry after working for him for  years I think. forgive me for the mistakes I haven t heard or read that one in a while. heck had to look up the story just for the names alone  dont have time to read it at the moment
imagine explaining these times to your grandkids wait a minute! she s 35!   I thought she was in her early-mid 20 s tf!!
the korean version already has a ton of outfits not out in the west yet and they re more skimpy.   p  they ll probably go unnoticed once the hype for the game burns down a little.  right now lost ark gets a bunch clicks in a few months kotaku will be onto something else more trendy.
sadge history... I really wanted to try lost ark
the game was censored and altered before release in the west. they folded before they started.
if you want to understand what the ideal journo-approved woman looks like in a game  take any of the warrior classes from lost ark and slap a woman s face on it. no body or outfit changes necessary.
its a fun game dont miss out because of the bullshit
I wish more people would take notice. no matter how much anyone caters to wokeness its never good enough. the solution to the mob is to just open with  no.
if this is actually such an issue  how about they put a survey out there for the players  as in  those who actually play the game  to see what they think about the outfits  one guy or gal who happens to write an article does not a playerbase make.
these woke revolutionaries are responsible for games like the last of us series crashing and burning. I am sick and tired of wokeness in video games. its my only escape from reality since movies and tv are flooded with woke ideology.
I am a day late but thank you once again. I always want to play as a beautiful character and having options for good looking men and women should always be an option.
never fold boomers!
I think someone needs to invent a game for these sensitive types where the chars are all sexually amorphous and are dressed in something like jedI robes  traditional nuns habits and full coverage niqabs. might sell one or two copies.
clearly  the industry has far too many people who cant recognize their survivability relies on the people who play their game and support them.
never apologize for anything!
I swear to God that if they cave to woke their never getting a cent out of me in lost ark!
so on this I feel like we differ somewhat. if there are only skimpy female armors it does bother me  but I think it comes down to a break in immersion for me. it doesnt offend me. skimpy outfits can still be there and I still want the non-skimpy outfits to look feminine.lara is the perfect example for me. she always looks sexy but still fairly practical. I personally do not want my character to raid tombs  fight in heels and a battle-kini. let it be an option  not mandatory.
I really like your opinion on femininity and masculinity. I also really like the scripture that you shared. thank you very much. God bless you and your family. duane.
this era in gaming comics shows and movies is what shall be none as the pussification era where entertainment is turned more into lectures ruining the stories and what made them so loved by its fans
being a member of the lonely hearts club isn t easy but you dont know what kind of mess you could find yourself in. could be better off single.
you ll eventually find that man that will protect you and make you feel that you feel feminine  and is close and loves God.
and just like that lost ark loses 1 3rd of its na player base.
tomb raider x dark souls makes a lot of sense because of the archeological aspect to her. would kinda bring it back to its roots in difficulty   exploration.
these individuals will never be happy no matter how much you try and pander to them. lol
practical battle armor   metal so thick that it would make a tank blush and weapons so large they literally clip through the world.edit  I just remember that there is a male skin that is topless.
I totally read that thumbnail as  wookies scared of hot women  now I got an image of a terrified chewbacca in my mind...
for me im not a huge fan of gender lock classes but when your forced to play either female class and I like playing as female character it takes the fun out of it
sadly the higher ups at game studios really care about publicity.even if the absolute majority of their players dont mind  say the female character designs having several high profile western games urinalist outlets complaining about them almost always is being taken ultra seriously and changes get implemented to appease them.
they re never for humanity s advancement but its downfall.
the movie 300 is a perfect example that while the man is head of the family  the woman is the head of the home.
melonie awesome video as always I hope you have an awesome day God bless you
I play lost ark and the player base is in an uproar. they do not want the skins and costumes censored. if ags and smilegate do censor the outfits they game is going to sink faster than new world.
great verse!
I saw you showing a talon! great  but are youreally ready to tear my enemy to shreds like a bird of prey like I am   talon of light
beautiful video. a lot of men are looking for a girl like you truly. Im married to a girl who thinks a lot like you and its a blessing. we re a team with God  order  logic and love
lol!  this reminds me of the clip I saw where this dude does a mashup.  there is a girl and she is like  why is that in video games male characters are covered in full armor and women only need a bikini.  and the dude straight faced answered  because their balls would fall out of the bikini.....anyway.   these companies need to stop trying to appease this small group of loud mouths that are more then likely not even playing their games in the first place.  these companies will never learn cow towing to like 9   if that  is going to piss off the actual majority of the player base and those that do enjoy gaming.  oof its hard watching companies and people do this kind of caving it makes you look weak and fragile.  like you said dont apologize for it.  just own it and stick to your guns.  the sooner these companies realize when they stand up and shut down this kind of nonsense the better their bottom line will be  the better their player base will be  everything will be just better.  these gaming companies need to be based not basted.
different game  but Im playing through some modded fallout 4 with a woman sole survivor.  having fun spending time with the game again.this lost ark situation does have me thinking that the next fallout may feature such character customization features as you mention. how the times are a-changing...
Im definitely a boomer but if they are scared of hot women than you must be terrifying to them and yes Im simping just a little
its a good game like surprisingly addictive  I have no issue my mage bring meteors from the sky in her high heels  kinda more badass
its funny cuz my gf isn t a gamer by any means  and hasn t played games since she was young. she used to play the old school mortal kombat games growing upI let her play the new one recently  and the first thing thatshe asked was   why do all the girls look like men now     and she was disappointed seeing that meleena and those chick s went from looking hot a.f to some masculine manly chick s lolanyways. like u said  most girls want to play as hot chick s too. these woke   low self esteem weirdos dont even play these games
damn  that rant at the end  now I want to go out and take care of someone
Ive always chose class over gender. like if I feel like playing a mage type  and the nearest to mage is a female.... well I guess Im a chick now.
they are still here man I thought they were looking for a new target
one of the big problems  is that its amazon who published the game  and they have already hit it with a black paintbrush wasting more development time.  its speculation atm  thatsome classes were cut becaue they needed more time to censore them. wether that is true   we ll ahve to wait and see. but htey have already modified teh game to be more woke.  Ive already come accross woke dialog in game  vivian for example has woke lines using sjw terminology..  so atm its in the hands of a left publisher. so its kinda in a high risk position.
fighting in 5 inch heels is the same unrealistic like fighting with 3m sword  but no one is complaining about the berserker class in lost ark.
the things are doing their pointless about changing characters outfits they need to focus on problem with bots  europe servers  and chat spamming in game. I do play the game but sometimes more they have problem that need to take care. but they have more problems.
let s make all male characters look like the snotty boy meme guy
boom  boom  boom  boom I want melonie in my room!...ok I ll see myself out.
as much as I love being in the role of a toxic male  I do like an independent woman that I dont have to worry about getting into some deep shit. whenever I hear some bro talking about taking a woman to the gun range as a first date  I cant even find an argument against it. nor should i.
my favorite part of the stream is when you jumped off the cliff.  lol
your scared of strong women also them nnnnno sexy wonen oppress real women reeeeeeeee
I hear ya on the limited dating pool...and the older we get the smaller it gets arg!
Ive been playing elden ring for a week  its hard af but rewarding.
I ll be honest  I have a more forgiving take on this. from what I cantell  the devs of lost ark wont be removing outfits and costumes that offended these journos  but they ll add outfits and costumes that aren t as sexualized. I dont consider that  bending the knee  because having more options is never a bad thing in general  let alone when discussing character customization. this article is mad that they aren t removing the sexualized outfits. the one thing I ll agree with the article on though  is the gender-locked classes. once again  more options are never a bad thing.
you should have a channel where youreview comic books
keep rolling chicky!!!
the only thing I think is wrong in lost ark are the giant weapons
that one twitter comment -  ... clock pendulum in a trenchcoat.
it would be great if the company approached the problem by saying they will give men bikinI armor
thank you steam for the uncensored adult games on the platform.
shoot you dont even have to participate to get a trophy. now they re handing out existence trophies
lost ark should ve doubled down and make the new armors more sexier out of spite.you would get more customers respect  and sales  that way.
as with jre  the ones complaining the loudest dont even play the game   or watch the podcast . these people are stealing all the oxygen.
I have a feeling that the one company that actually stands up to these creeps by not backing down  bending the knee  or apologizing for their game movie book tv show will receive a massive influx of goodwill and money from the regular people. let the weirdo freaks cry on twitter.....not sure why people even care.
I remember when snl had this character named pat who was androgynous. woke snl now pretends that didn t exist. the point being is androgyny is something that woke bullies seem to love to promote as sexy and ideal. I would bet that most people dont think thats sexy at all. I remember this girl from back in hs that was h bomb hot. the wokies would have attacked her relentlessly for it. I would consider that to be a badge of honor. when you are hated by the wokies you are probably doing something right.
omg love the great explosion murder God dynamight hoodie!
you should upload your game streams to this channel as well to boost your views  idk just an idea.
amen sister.
players voiced frustration. are they sure those were actual players
good times
forreaaaal
and every day op abusive broke things are discovered in elden.
@hermit card   right
oooo
that would ruin my traction here as my gaming videos dont get as many views. I just keep those on my meloniemac channel haha
@melonie mac go boom  I know nothing about the inner workings of youtube so I bow to your knowledge on the matter and say mkay then
love that hoodie!
29 00 men men men men  manly men men men!two and a half men theme song lol
this is like buying a new car and saying  nah its too perfect  I want that rusted  dented  with a bent frame look.  but yeah  it will be nice to see what design features are used the most. this game was already delayed for around 2 years to cater to supposed western audience and still it isn t enough with the woke crowd.
amazon makes me want to just go back to the russian version of the game
100  agree with Bible verse  gender role convo ... good stuff
love the bakugo katsukI hoodie  are you watching the anime  maybe reading the manga
the walk is similar to karen gillan in jimanjiI 2.
I would love to see a zelda dark souls game.
like omg mel. dont you know you are being oppressed in america because a korean developer showed a womynx ankles!! fine  I will speak on your behalf  me an ally a male feminist  look I remember being told if I had an issue with some thing then it wasn t made for me. so  yeah this game wasn t made for them and so they are cry bullying to get what they want even thought they wont touch the game. same old shit  different day.
if there was a soulslike tomb raider  how would you handle combat and weapons
the dead or alive games changed their character outfits to please the wokies and it killed the franchise because it wasn t what their fans wanted.
no exposed shoulders from melonie today.
golden river is the fucking boss! thats the right answer  modest and sexy outfits can coexist  the existence of one doesnt mean the other needs to go away
man if I were a game maker and people startedbitching about these things I would jsut include a string bikinI suit and say its because of them
melonie youre failing to understand that to these people they think what people find sexy is sexist they are clearly just jealous that they dont fit into these archetypes and therefore feel the need to bash them and also for some reason they think that they need a body type in a game that matches theory own or that game game is trash while failing to realize that people play games not to see themselves in the roles of the characters but to escape from reality I think these people cant differentiate between fiction and reality
did anyone else notice that berserker is going to be a female only class  talk about a master troll to mess with the  reporter  like that. as for the classes shown  the girl in that lineup is an  acrobat shooter  she jumps around a lot.  the guy that you like I haven t seen him around.
love the bakugo hoodie
when it come hot women in games. I seen skyrim s modding community. there are women modders who mass produce hot npc conversion packs  add new hot followers often with themselves voicing them. and they also produce hot outfits.
Im bisexual. I like hot menz and hot wimmins. Im female so its not the  male gaze . please dont take my eye candy away!!!
what ever happened to  if you dont like it  dont watch  listen  or play it   developers shouldn t have to change things because mobs like this dont like it. people should have creative freedom to make what they please.
its so disturbing how quickly american society swings towards puritan prude sex shaming behavior. I feel like the mid 90s-earlu 00s had expression freedom. then right back to judgment on the behalf of others morals. the poster board slogans may be different but the outcome is the same. boobies again are bad. saying you like boobies makes you bad. wont someone think of the children wokies!
real woke talk   I transitioned to a woman   what is a woman    I cant define that   ok.
as long as I get a variety of choice Im happy. if every single outfit was just skimpy clothing for women or jacked armor for men  then I could see there being some issue. but there are ton of variety even through regular gear you get just for playing the game. and considering the cash shop it negates the majority of these  feminist  complaints because there is a ton of variety.
melonie mac is my favorite
whoever did that walking animation did a bad job  the company should just fire the guy and let the girl t-pose and float away from the character.
hope the project eve devs stick to their original design.
lost ark go boom! man I have a ton of boom jokes lol
these are facts.1. not everyone has the same taste.2. there are people who like those designs.3. they are allowed to make a game for those people.
more and more respect to pearl abyss with black desert online. hot babes are still front and center.
any time allotted to making the journos happy takes time away from adding content. I really wish devs went through these changes and and release a statistical analysis on whether or not its worth the effort. I highly doubt the outcome would favour the journos whining.
I initially developed an interest in this game specifically because it angered the sjw crowd. I was planning to give it a go after I finished code vein  another great game that had them complaining   but now I am reconsidering. if they are willing to cave to the woke mod so easily  they are likely not worth my time.
the people demanding changes aren t going to buy it  anyway.
I dont think these people are even playing the game or even if they are  a lot of them probably just played less than 10hrs xd
once I hit 40 I stopped being scared of hot women...you dont scare me melonie.lol!my friend  Im an older gentleman so I hope its okay if I give you a little bit of advice. Im seriously just trying to be helpful.perhaps you could set aside certain evenings where you dont have to concentrate on anything serious and just bask in your feminine energy as you call it.you know  be in areas with a certain kind of alpha male type of successful men.Imean if you want to start a family as a woman youre kind of on a clock. and right now you probably have the very best chance to get the best man possible.you know what Imean  I really believe you can be a strong woman taking care of yourself and still be very feminine around the right men.and yeah  I know feminist indoctrination in the west has really screwed things up.so many men have been convinced if they re softer and more emotional and allow a woman to take the lead overall it makes them appealing to the opposite sex....all lies of course. Imean granted  there are exceptions to almost anything.I wish you luck and may God bless you on your journey
wokies   women can dress how they want!! slut shaming is wrong!!! also wokies   she s too hawt!! make her trans!! this is why I dont socialize.  it was already a minefield before  but now with bi-polar having been normalize and embraced  its just even less than desirable to interact with the rest of the world outside of text.  Im not on this earth to cater to every randos feelings and try to be friends with everyone.  you either sense my good intentions and realize Im not trying to upset people  or youre just not going to get my drift.  I call out hypocrisy and just plain stupid ideas  and I attack people when they attack me.  Im no saint and never claimed to be  Im not always right  and Im not always nice.  I try to do no harm  but my shoes step on as many bugs as the next person  you know what Imean   I think if people put less emphasis on feelings and focused more on sticking to one ideal instead of trying to adopt both sides of an issue  they d be doing a lot better.
I doubt you ll read this  but I hope that God brings you a good man who can protect you and love you.
if youre going to go for a mmo. play ffxiv instead    gotta wonder if the company its doing it or amazon is forcing them to adjust to  mooodeeern audieeenceeees . of course  no one is talking about the predatory monetization  just the boobies.
tish going to whine  company might cave  we re going to learn they were never going to buy the game.this lesson isn t hard to see  every time a company caves to the ironic moral police there is failure in the wing.
ffs  its a video game  where we re supposed to have fantasy characters that are sexy  strong and the physical ideals of both sexes. they re trying to make drama where there isn t any need for it.
I wish more people understood what you say about men and women.  if they did the divorce rate in the us would seriously tank.  instead of viewing a marriage as a living seperate and equal type thing having it viewed as a partnership of strength and aligned principles grounded in a form of faith would do the world some good.

the second a game caves I bail. I was slightly interested. the game is dead to me now.
did anita sarkeesian complain that hot women in video games are sexist again
if you think the animation got roasted when it was a girl running that way  imagine how much fun would have been made if it was a dude  lol!
i believe that everything happens for a reason. people change so that you can learn to let go  things go wrong so that you appreciate them when they re right  you believe lies so you eventually learn to trust no one but yourself  and sometimes good things fall apart so better things can fall together.
do the woke women hate hot women because they re insecure   because the closest I get to agreeing with them at all is how often hot women are the default while unattractive men are more common than unattractive women.
I really cant say I agree. yeah  obviously people making the game should make what they want to make first  but then listen to their players second  because their players are... obviously the ones playing the game and they want the game to be better more enjoyable for them. I for one have no interest in playing lost ark mainly because of the genderlocked classes.also disagree with the assessment if youre attracted to women  you ll be more attracted to the gunslinger  and if youre attracted to men  you ll be attracted to the deadeye. Im attracted to both men and women  and find the deadeye design more attractive because sex appeal doesnt appear to have been at the foremost of the design. designing for sex appeal has to be a choice in itself  to tell you about the character  not just the default for female characters.
where were these people when he-man  conan the barbarian  etc. were walking around with no shirt on
it always makes me laugh when people complain about female armor designs in fantasy as they tend go to realism and they think the only thing realistic would be to be loaded with armor. in real fights  real warriors sometimes chose to fight naked so that they can move faster and not tire out  your armor will hardly protect you if you are unable to move by the time it takes to approach your enemy.
100  agree
I have no shame in saying that I would like every female character in games I play to be hot.  that definition may vary  but there should be a standard.  if youre ever thinking  let s make sure to include  real  women  take a step back  and put in your 2 weeks notice.
never bow down to the mob. I love my men sexy  I love my women sexy. that could be a bI thing but  still!!! that is true equality in a game! everyone is sexy! I love cute walks and runs in some games. I loved how yuna loved in ffx and ffx-2. she was so dainty and sweet. but apparently  thats bad! I love some of the clothes in games for men and some for women  espeically in japanese games! like  I play heavily modded skyrim and fo4....I have animation mods  body mods  clothing mods for my male and female characters. but  thats disgusting according to the wokies!
meanwhile amouranth wearing a bikinI in a ball pit is on g4tv wtf are these people trying to pull...
if this game makes character models of the other gender for gender locked classes I hope they stick them on the cash shop.  then we can see even more outrage.
of course it folded  it already censored and altered the game in the first place.
lost ark ags still haven t realised that the people complaining about the scanty armour haven t ever played their game and never will. but expending precious resources to remake all the armour-pieces will just cause the game to fail... oh well.I went and removed lost ark from my  wish list   since they knelt to the wokies I have no intention of supporting them.
man  Im tired of hearing these people wanting to change games to how they want to see it  which ruins the players enjoyment if the game. which makes me happy when companies like sega dont listen to these people in their game like the yakuza games which I enjoy a lot  plus the creator said that it was made for men but lots of women like the masculinity that the games show.
just like susan white chicky...she cant delete fast enough!dont take the mark of the beast!
Imiss games being about the game  stories  characters  power fantasies and losing yourself in crazy  inventive worlds where anything is possible...I dont care at  all about this real world politics and  life lessons  or fake morals and virtue signaling from people who have no experience in life other than their twitter feed and fake conversations with their pet plants xd
Imean all the men are also big chunks with just muscles everywhere but I dont see them complaining about that
Im very happy I did not get lost ark because looks like they dont want my money over trying to make woke people happy rather people who actually like the game.
I disagree even with that point. unattractive men are not more common in games. most are either handsome and  regular fit or handsome and ripped like an 80s action hero. hot men and women are the default.
eh depends  hand to hand sure be naked  but with weapons full plate armor is way better. fantasy armor  both men and women  isn t usually practical and we dont need to defend it as such. if an artist or developer want to focus on aesthetics than practicallity then they should... its fantasy
@- yosuke -  I was not counting shields as wearing armor  as naked warriors often had a weapon in 1 hand and a shield in the other. I personally would want at least some form of protection on  but that does not change that real warriors did it in real bloody combat  which makes discussion of what is  realistic  or  practical  for a fictional character laughable. especially giving as the same people dont say anything about male characters rocking the loincloth barbarian look  the only thing people want fantasy women protected from with armor is the evil male gaze  but they dont want to say it and come off as pearl-clutching.
I feel the same way. I dont like to play as ugly characters period if they are humanoid.   if you see ugly characters on a game cover  are you more or less likely to be drawn to pick up the game and try it
at what height does a guy need to properly hone his masculinity
I just wish the male characters looked like robert pattinson sans shirt
in the battle for sexy female characters  please dont make lost arc the hill to die on. that animation that melanie couldn t not laugh at actually ruins the cutscenes in the story.the launch armor for the mage- bard  is laughingly bad. not because its skimpy  but because it doesnt fit the world and what other people wear. you look like you belong in the a different game. and there is technically only one set of armor  it just adds more ribbons as you get better armor.
if you want my body  and if you think Im sexy  come on sugar let me know.     -rod stewart
video games are made the way the are now-more clues  etc  well  it has to do with gen z and to some respects millennials. its been shown that with definitely gen zers they have a very short attention span. that is so sad.  and this is the generation that is supposedly the most intelligent. this is the generation that because they cam build stuff in fortnite that makes them potentially good critical thinkers and designers.yea  this generation you have to constantly keep their attention going. when I play a game  its not just about the gameplay  its the story as well. I love exploring when Im playing.
when people were complaining about manly looking female characters in games like tlou2  these same people were saying  thats how they wanted to make their game! you dont have any right to tell them different!  but when it comes to a game that offends their sensibilities the game needs to change.
I see young supposed men in my area and they act so femine now  girly. the percentage grows. product of their environment maybe.
personally I never liked sexy armor since I take combat very seriously  be it for guys or gals. namely with factors like protecting your innards from getting crushed  stabbed  disemboweled  perforated  etc. and not freezing to death in cold  arctic regions.but as a writer and artist who supports creative freedom  I dont dictate what people can or cant do. you want to look  sexy   go ahead. I will make jokes along the lines of  enjoy getting stabbed   but in an in-character sort of way.also for the wokies  if you feel this self-conscious over fictional characters by comparing youself to them  lay off the junk food.
I dont play games that fold to those who really are not fans.
who pays these people  Im not convinced that these journos even play games outside the job.I have never heard a gamer complain because the characters are sexy or confident.
sexy female character   check your polygons  bigot.sexy male character   hey hey  oh oh  pixel supremacy got to go !hyper femininity   you savefile slot !hyper masculinity   toxic memory allocation in all its splendor.almost like the writer and the ever-offended twitteristas feels threatened by women and men alike in video games. dont stop being one of reason s voice melonie  gaming has been ruined by politically correct fascistas for long enough now  sadly.also funny side note   the game looked promising when it was revealed three years ago  if I remember correctly  but remember it belongs to amazon games now   the same publisher which bought a fork of the crytek and called it lumberyard  the same studio which developed new world with it and sanked it because its in-game economy was unreliable  the same studio which sent back into beta their game crucible and killed it there and also cancelled their moba game breakaway...
is it time for justin timberlake to bring sexy back
how great is your life when your job is to be upset that game  a game you chose to play is offensive. you have the free time to enjoy something  and thatsomething that you chose you have an issue with. not only that but the thing you chose was from a different culture.
wow  how has a good Godly man not married you yet
in the end  they want the femine character to be like the masculine  but with long hair and feminine voice. and the americans cry about it  and then in europe we those dumb changes too....my friends complain that there is no male versions for wizards. 14 00 if an argument includes sarkesian or feminist frequency  it is automatically wrong and rejected in every rationale debate
funny how people complain about the portrayal of sexiness in female characters  but I never hear bitching about the males  they need to be consistent.
n this is why I stick to old mmo they never fold
when  imbalances  is just woke bigot for  diversity I disapprove of .  diversity means differences. what do they want  diversity or equality  the two are literally listed as antonyms in the dictionary or thesaurus. if you want diversity you must learn to celebrate meaningful inequalities.
I ll never understand these people.
souls tomb raider  so basically classic tomb raider.17 23100  agree  but the problem  for a long time  is that people have no patience.19 03I agree  but I wouldn t say the devs are lazy. its the players that dont care for engaging gameplay. for 15 years its been like that. if people dont have a hint or dont know where to go  they get frustrated  drop the game then complain to the devs. I would like most games to back to the old days where there were no hints  but we know thats not going to happen.
a guy can be masculine regardless of his height  p
@melonie mac go boom  thank you for that info.  Ive always heard the opposite growing up.
it is sad how we   cant stand strong female characters   and need to get over it  but pointing out they cant stand good looking women is wrong somehow.
the fucked up thing about all this isn t even that they want the game to be more balanced in terms of outfits. its that if it was the other way around  only boring ass prudish costumes were offered in a korean game  they would be perfectly content and wouldn t bat an eye to it. you wouldn t see articles about how they wish there were more attractive alternatives being offered. you wouldn t see them desperately trying to find people advocating for that kind of stuff. they wouldn t call it a backlash either. the only way they can respect a woman is by putting a burlap sack over them.
have you ever played any of the dragon age games  Imay have asked this before and if so sorry boss boomer my memory lags a bit now and then
a random journo criticizes a fantasy game for not being realistic. sounds like the opening line to a bad joke.
many girls have told me that they dont like to be masculine.
anyone who thinks the Bible is sexist needs to read the story of esther!
you gotta love the hypocrisy of male characters being sexed up and whatever in games and yet nothing said  but its only a problem with attractive looking female characters. I dunno about anyone else  but these complainers seem more like the sexist ones. where were all these people when xenoblade de was released where you can play as dude in just his shorts  of course they complained and still do about xenoblade 2 s pyra and mythra boobs though. btw  I highly recommend xenoblade games as they re some of the greatest games ever made with a new installment coming this year in september  -
can u use boomies instead of boomers. or something idk  but I just found u today  and it feels like I entered a viewerbase full of oldies. I get this channel is new so hopefully u open to changing things up a bit
hey mel I just want to tell you that I dont understand why there is so much of mob issues with each video games. anyway I dont know why people have so much of hate with this video games problem. anyway it is just a video game that girls and boys love to play. anyway I just wish that people would just stop being a mob and stop mobbing the video games and just let the girls and boys play video games and leave the video games industry alone  ok mel. anyway I just want to say bout this topic of lost ark  ok mel. anyway hope you have a wonderful and great blessed day today at home and at the gym. also hope you have a wonderful and great blessed evening at home with your pets too  ok mel.
esto vir  - be a man  in latin.
I love how some wokies jump in here just to give some thumbs down. lol
29 27 awry1 deserves some1
holy shit  dude. youre 35  what kind of diet regime you got going  because I was certain you were in your early 20s  not close to my age.
I think I would love to see a game company with a game  for the fun I use the example tomb raider but you could imagine every other game  with critical articles like everything is to sexy blablabla and the answer is  ok sorry here is the update  and then in the game lara only wahres her bag  gun s and shoes.... nothing els.... no top... no shorts.... free nI  ls and free v .... and to go to the extrem sometimg like.... even bigger b  bs and even smaller waist.... like ulta hyper femininity on steroidsand in the option menu a toggle with the name  sjw mode  or  snowflake mode  and this option changes lara back to  normal  .... classic sexy lara with clothes
any video game company  especially japanese and korean companies  that kuk out and bend the knee to western wokies on social media  automatically loses all of my respect.
ha!... dont tell them about black desert online... they ll blow a gasket for sure over that one..
Im not scared of hot females. now I have scared plenty of them away  but uh we wont examine that.
so you have to install games on console s now! welcome to pc gaming
games are just for entertainment and not a social commentary people must have very shallow lives if they have to psychoanalyse every single game.
they did the same thing to tera online
as nerdrotic points out  every time they go for a broader audience  they get a smaller audience  because they alienate the fanbase.
yes  origins and inquisition. I like origins a lot
well  amazon is full on woke so its no surprise they re doing this to lost ark. might be time to play a different mmo...
Im offended my character cant wear a burka!  reeeeeeeeeeee!
guess which game I wont support anymore
almost 25k!! yay!!
dope bakugo hoodie
viva la dirt league s epic npc man addressed this very issue. https   youtu.be -vi5tdorhc0if wanted to play a mannish character  I d play as a man.  keep on keeping on  mel  from a boomer boomer.
in what way can you outman a man
ngl  seeing buff dudes in bikinI armour sounds weird  but if some folks wanted that  go for it! I just wont put them on my character. but we all know the score with these wokies  and mankinis are not on their checklist.
lost ark needs to add a american flag bikinI s and vietnam era weapons     !!!!!!!!!
men and woman s have there own strengths to  deal with challenges unique to there own situation  but what s best is when both use there strengths to protect each others weakness. sounds corny I know!!
cool hoodie
well. this blows. twitter locked my account for a week or longer. ooops ahahaha
I have seen a nick minaj video I know the ladies wear those clothes.
honestly I think a lot of it has to do with single parent households and how the powers that be have structured society Imean men used to have trades and they were passed on to their sons and women have always inspired men with their beauty and as you say softness women cant be like men at all and men cant even touch what women are like that why they need each other people are all different for sure  honestly when I see women try to take the place of a man its been a crude mockery at best just like all these flakes pretending they know what its like to be a woman just wish we could acknowledge that both have their own ways and that they are valid and stop making excuses
now do this walk cycle https   www.youtube.com watch v cldqp3wwevk
I dont know im just a gamer and all  im 27 now buuut I started to realize thatsociety is getting more and more cringe around 2015 since then it only gotten worse before that I think most people where just   trolling   for atterntion now they actually serious about it what a bunch of losers
commenting to feed the algorithm
they folded  awww uninstalling
ohh good another game I do not have to boycott as I will not be playing  this hold me by the hand game anyway.
Im of the opinion that wokesters are just jealous of fictitious cgI babes.
also just as an aside I had to move to the woods and distance myself from my friends and society just to get back what it means to be a man honestly its just so insulting to hear women say they have to be a mommy and daddy when they cant bring what a male brings to the table at all now they may try really hard and thats commendable but its just pretend being a man is mostly about suffering and discipline
its a funny walk  but is it good enough to get funding from the ministry of funny walks
remember the days when people were inspired to be better   those days are gone. now we have the trend of inspiring people to be their worst. and the same people who are behind that wonder why society is in a decline. utter stupidity   selfishness   complete lack of morals   responsibility. pathetic.
if there is anything that devd could benefit the most from is dont bother to listen to the wokes because the majority of the time they dont even bother to look at the game let alone buy it. and as it been shown time and time again. even if the devs check off all the bs that the wokies demand its still not enough.  their entire lives revolve around the never-ending wave of complaining.  their lives is nothing but negativity and their only goal is to make everyone as miserable as they are. God  forsake they actually do something to improve their mood. but what do you expect from a section of society that always plays the victim and blames everyone else except themselves   they really should go boom!
go on fnt mel.
they covering up the bare chest of the males if not they are hypocrites
for what Ive seen  even straight feminists prefer a masculine man.
there are no practical player armor
men like to see hot women on their media.women like to see hot women on their media.a tiny portion of weird people get their panties in a bunch when they see hot women.guess to whom these companies always bend their knee.
that  understood the assignment  crap. ugh
lets be honest they not even playing the game and sooo salty about it
ps5 for the win
those complaining are either male feminists or they want to force their body issues on everyone else. also  isn t body shaming wrong  or are the rules amorphous
company bends knee to woke mob  -100 respect points lost
some conservatives and some feminists must have the same agenda about sexy womans in video games. I want porn games so im not on thatside of things.
3 57 wait a minute... thats misleading as f  they re talking about sexist design and when you click the source people are just laughing at the scuffed animation. they really are trying hard to make this game bend to  western rules
damn shamedamn wokes ruin everything
just based on the title Im uninstalling.
those bigots need to respect other people s culture. wow  thats weird saying that. did I say it right
Im glad Im droped this game. if you bown down to the mob  even if a little  Im not playing your game. it is as simple as that.
I imagine in a week or two it ll be that the women aren t fat enough. so prepare for fully clothed  gigantically large women who will be indistinguishable from the men. if they cave once  they will cave again. its amazon after all.
the 25th
why is it that female character always have to wear more clothes  why dont we go ahead and make male characters wear less clothes thats the solution we need  its a win win for male and female gamers out there
day 10 of commeniting on your videos until g-fuel sponsors me. I only play as hot women in mmos. its a matter of survival. ppl dont come to save you if your character is a dude but if youre ac chick  weebs come to defend the wahmun so I ll take advantage of that hahahaha
you dont look 35.  I hope you find someone.  the dating scene is rough.
I say quit playing any games that go woke. plenty to pick from.
hello fresh is how stay in shape by less calories intake have been half blind by means receiving a lot more then what seem fair at this point during 2006 had glassware by school itself an entire time period ago was long time ago
every single tomboot game I got was free only   wasnt spending money on that trash
Im new here  but youre a woman  who loves video games  is antI woke and antI feminist  and loves Jesus    sign me up! Ive been dying to date someone that checks those boxes!
activists ruin video games
first boomer  -
lost ark is pretty fun. but if they are gonna please the woke community. I am gonna uninstall.
Im afraid your traditional role of man an woman are dead.  corporate america did that.  it is the result of decades of lawsuits.  you might find someone with like mind in a church group.  he might be in law enforcement since you like that type of guy.  in fact I think you would contribute greatly in law enforcement.  and that is not because you look great in a uniform.
gender imbalance  one of the best characters if not the best character is a female. and her  gear  is a modest dress or skirt. good Lord people are dumb. if you dont like a game then dont play it. you dont have ownership over a f2p game so stop acting as if you do. also  I liked the vid. happy gaming.
I was about to download but... not any longer...dont like a game  dont play it...lost ark is now on the dislike list
so the reason people like korean games  the skimpy outfits and character models  seriously  ask anyone who plays these games  is bad. so what youre left with is another lame  watered down  run of the mill product no one will enjoy.
lol I went to go watch the feminist frequency butt coverings video and the comments are turned off lol I just left a dislike only because of that
hahayou say  the Bible  never said that women are less than men but you didn t mention which Bible.muslims have one too
I hate woke  sjw etc. but sorry- after many years of playing games  im really tired of  pornstars  in rpgs. I want female warriors  not models.
melonie - gotta baby the americans.me - um  aren t you an american  mel   probably should really had thought about that one first  my friend. not all americans are a bunch of cry babies. when it comes to games I play  I want to be challenged but  I also want to have fun. not have someone being like an invisible hand guiding me through everything and making it too easy.
let the players decide how much clothes they want to wear  problem solved!    problem is the wokies want to take the urgency of choice away from you unless you have the exact same choices as them. basically they are full on fascists.
I didn t say all americans were like that. Ivery clearly articulated that the wokies are trying to speak for us and other countries think we are all like that as a result.
