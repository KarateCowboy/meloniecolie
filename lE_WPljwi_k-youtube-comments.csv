all I am saying is  the words  sex  and  kids  should never be in the same sentence with each other  period. this is just next level creepy
you know what makes me happy  how many female youtubers Im seeing calling out this shit. God bless the melonie macs of the world  we need strong women like them right now more than ever before.
ricky gervais speech at the golden globes becomes more factual every day. its absolutely disgusting what disney and she-hulk were trying to do.
I got that vibe from the show. it was constantly being  sex positive.  but not in a healthy way. not a  adults in loving relationships have sex and its nothing to be ashamed of.  it is more of a  be as slutty as you want kids  it doesnt have any real life consequences. its empowering!  ignoring the fact that having sex at too young of an age is bad for the brain and sexual health. sex with multiple partners is a great increase for std  stis and bad effects on mental health.
I said this in a video earlier  sex positive  and  kids  should not be in the same sentence. the fact thatshe doesnt even consider it to be anything wrong is crazy to me
former thug   did you make love  jenn   ew  no! we just had sex! this is an example of the importance of proper phrasing. by having jenn respond the way she had  it implies that jenn didn t see josh as anything more than an outlet to satisfy a physical need and implying it was anything more than that  making love normally involves a deeper connection than just the physical sense - i.e. the partner is more than a boink buddy  is just a disgusting concept to her.so jenn obsessing oven being ghosted by someone who she - by her own reply - saw only as a sexual outlet makes no sense  if it was the other way around - with the thug asking if they had sex and jenn replying with  ew  no! we made love!  would make her actions far more understandable .
I agree melonie. this culture has twisted itself into a pretzel trying to justify the depravity they are peddling. you are right love is sacred
several comic characters like john constantine and jessica jones often engage in casual sex but its never really glorified like this. both john and jessica use self-indulgence as a coping mechanism to drown out their psychological trauma and its portrayed as unhealthy and self-destructive behavior that they both continually struggle not to fall back into. a lot of time they end up being their own worst enemy.
its so weird how she used a story of a nine year old emailing her about how much she liked the show or whatever to justify the  sex positivity . me as someone who is young  16  this show did absolutely nothing for me in that domain this show was not even enjoyable. and pushing hook up culture to children is just wrong.
the dialogue  eww  we didn t make love  we just had sex  would be great if the point was to show how damaged and unhappy she is. but I guess the point was to show how empowered she is.
I love that you arent afraid to tackle these uncomfortable subjects. if you and other brave streamers dont  who will  I love you for your courage and morality.
how in the hell did we go from john favreau s iron man to this
she-hulk is easily one of the horniest shows currently streaming on disney plus walt s legacy secured
melonie is 100 percent on point  you dont see a lot of people online who will stand against this kind of perversion  corn and  sex work  has been a massive detriment to future generations  and im glad to see a young person online talk about it this way  not enough like you  best of luck in your fight to help the culture!!
its really refreshing to hear a female perspective on all this stuff. really hope to see more female creators make content like this. even if its more left leaning  but I have yet to find a pro she-hulk audience review lol
no youtuber inspires me the way you do  I really mean it. you make your points without sarcasm and disrespect  you are genuinely a good person. the world needs more people like you.
Im a millenial too and Im ashamed of the way our generation has treated relationships and sex. Imade the mistake in my early 20 s of buying into the sexual revolution nonsense and it really messed up a lot of my life for many years. I feel bad for gen-z and hope that this can be turned around because a good relationship and marriage will be far better than all the sex in the world with random people.
its so disgusting the minds by hind these projects. thank you melonie for bringing this to our attention. hook up culture is dumb and damaging. side note love seeing my name down at the bottom of your twitter screen. good video. and hopefully many  many more. again thanks melonie. have a good day!
parents are the only ones who should be talking to their children about sex  no one else.
there s too many people without kids  without basic morality  trying to get access to other people s kids. whether its predatory or  trying to educate  or leave some kind of legacy their own broken lives are lacking  its too far. leave kids alone.
agreed  with the exception of your first sentence in your comment
@jonathan w  not to pull a twitter  and feel free to correct me if I am wrong  but what you are saying is you support teaching little kids about sex and having them exposed to that at a very early age  even encouraging it  thats creepy dude
@blyat  bruh it was a joke because you used the words sex and kids in the same sentence. I completely agree with your point
@jonathan w  ah  alright lol. that was my bad for not realizing it was a joke  just glad you dont think its a good idea
@blyat  all good it wasn t a good joke
whats the best age for sex education
@deska diaz  the best age is at least after kids know they can refuse and that there are lasting effects.
@deska diaz  I say around 5th grade when the change starts but not to this level and even still you start off small with this type of stuff if not handle correctly can fuck up people
facts
itshould be women calling it out. this is largely a women s issue caused by women.
agreed!!!!
eventually they always know which side their bread is buttered on.
yeah same here! it really caught me off guard at first but damn they on the front lines for us foreal! love to see it.
agree
God bless the melonie macs!
thatsounds nice bro. but let s face it  90  of women are in la la land. most of them would disagree with our host here
ong
amen!
@changobango  go back to reddit
@deska diaz  I d say thats the responsibility of the parents. thats the type of education that is up to the parents  not teachers. my  sex education  was  chastity until marriage . and my parents didn t even have to  convince  me of that. I just had to look at how well it turned out for society to reject this notion since the sexual revolution
not just creepy  absolutely disgusting. they needs a trip to the gallows
@blyat  teaching kids about sex is not creepy. far from it. its far easier to protect kids from sexual abuse if they know what sex is. data has shown this.
@mighty  agree! also  it need to be a serious classnot a tv showthe thing is im sure the creator of this video would answer  when their 18
@cloten candy  okay creep. fbI is gonna be watching you
@sheepdog  I personally blame the  let s be free of the  repressive Christian sexual ethics   ethic. cuz once thats what ppl decided  why not one step further   and another  and another the slippery slope was real and tons of ppl who warned against this were laughed at. now ppl are fighting for no limits to sex but consent  regardless of blood  age  species etc.
@cloten candy  its better to teach them at the age of 9 10 because that is the general age kids are curious or are around other kids who know or are taught or should be taught. first ant foremost what kids should learn first of all is respect  respect and respect. this is why our society is declining because there is a great lack of respect for elders  for peers and for ourselves.
@cloten candy  thank you!!
fbI come get these creeps in the comments!
@shepard s p1e  9 10 are still very much kids so I stand by what I said.
@stealthkillz311  when you dont know nothing about the topic just do what this guy is doing
@deska diaz  what  Im literally against teaching kids and exposing them to thatshit  and find itsickening. where did youread I am for kids getting molested  because that was nowhere to be seen. seems like you are just projecting  kinda exposing yourself rn ngl
@deska diaz  wow  that was quite strawman. Imeant it as a general principle that the parents are the ones responsible for teaching children these things not the teachers. so clarifying no its not okay its totally wrong but Im talking about it generally.
@blyat   have you made any research about sex education  how it can help kids  or did you pulled that opinion out of thin air because you dont like it  most of you guys are talking about yourself feelings putting kids at risk because  like I and the other guy already said  sex education can help kids against sexual abuse.
@deska diaz  ok groomer.
absolutely agree. there are a lot of confused kids out there who have been watching these shows.
@jonathan w  nah it wasn t just a joke  it was actually quite literate. I get what you meant
I think  you shouldn t have sex with kids  is a valid sentence with those two words.
well  you have to have sex if you want to have kids... something I think every woman should be told.
@vitor menezes de mattos  there are plenty of reasons to not go one step further. the  be free of Christian sexual ethics  ethic is not that bad if there are regulations beyond religious ethics. it doesnt have to be a slippery slope. unfortunately that isn t what s happening.
or  drag queen  and  kids   or  trans  and  kids .
@deska diaz  thats a really good question and a difficult one. Im not a parent  so I dont know what the right age is for kids to have that knowledge. for me  my parents told me about sex when I was 12  unfortunately I dont think they explained that great because I didn t understand at the time  so I was naive about it until I reached age 16 was where it clicked for me. so I dont know what s the right age to talk to kids about sex  considering what disney is doing with this shehulk garbage imposing sexual content for kids to see is disgusting so its really hard to say a defined answer to that. all I can say is its up to the parents to decide when is the right time.
@summer rose  I completely agree thatshe-hulk isn t sex edmf only did one night stands that doesnt teach anything im not saying the ons are bad but that not sex edmy parents never though me shit about sex ed thank God I had a teacher explain to me a lot of things because I was lostleaving important things up to parents isn t that goodsound good on paper but when we look at the results not the best thing
@vitor menezes de mattos  you are correct  it is extremely beneficial  but it is also unrealistic and you cant really enforce it on everyone.  with proper safe guards having sex once in a stable relationship can still avoid having a dysfunctional family as well as the other negative affects. you dont need to be married to understand you are in a stable relationship. my main argument though is that people have the freedom to do what they want and will simply have to suffer the consequences from those actions.
sex is how kids are made. is something wrong with that
@deska diaz  for them the best age is never at all even when we know kids need to start learning about it as young as 4 which is backed up by one 70 years of research
@blyat  nothing they said is wrong or illegal. you just want to his the facts from kids when knowing is better
@vitor menezes de mattos  thats literally wrong.  doctors and teachers should be teaching this to them   not parents because kids dont want to talk to their parents about this
@darkstalkerknight63  and if a parent is ignorant about human biology  maths  or history  how canthey teach their children those things of course teachers who are trained to educate should do so. puritanical parents  unfortunately raised in ignorance  just aren t equipped to arm children with this knowledge that could well save them from abuse  infection  or pregnancy.many people who had s x education solely from their parent s   dont even know that women have 3 ports on their undercarriage  and think that circumcising babies is painless and necessary.
@deska diaz  dont @ me weirdo. fbI come get this guy!
agreed
@stealthkillz311  nothing they said would cause them to do that
@naptosis  exactly. look at mississippI and other conservative states to why letting that happen is a bad idea. they are the same states with the highest teen pregnancy  and who gets the most welfare
@darkstalkerknight63  spelling issue
@blyat  those states also have the lowest education rates and grades
I disagree. and you proved it with your very own sentence. you used  sex  and  kids  on the same sentence.other similar sentences like  kids should never have sex  also meet the criteria of having both words on an apropriate sentence. kids are born because their parents had sex  would be another example.see  having  sex  and  kids  on a single sentence can be fine. it depends on the rest of the sentence.
@cmdr. redmonkey  false but thats what the groomers want you to think
@blyat  you missed the joke dude
let s read what was actually said  we always felt like there was a fear around sex and around the idea of sex positivity   coiro says.  so it was our job to keep having the conversation. we wanted to say  look  she s a woman in her 30s navigating modern life  sex is a part of thatstory  and  ask  how far could we go. let s read what the writer saidshe-hulk is easily one of the horniest shows currently streaming on disney plus  and for that  one of the most refreshing. but coiro says that her goal was still to deliver a show that could play to the broader  youth-skewing marvel audience. the director says she-hulk is the first show she s ever really worked on where she was receiving voicemails from 9-year-olds begging to hear what happened next. and her parents and friends who normally didn t watch marvel movies were hooked on she-hulk. there was a greater responsibility and challenge to make she-hulk be everything for everyone  without losing its commentary. let s read what the director said we wanted to make it realistic  and about a woman navigating sex  but also make itsomething that everybody can enjoy  including children  because there is an element of the show that is really fun for young people   she says.funny how she lied and made itseem like the director said that
@michael quaid  I wouldn t go that high. more women agree with melonie than not. the kooky ones are the ones that have the proverbial microphone and make it look like they are a majority.
yes!
amen  brother
@vitor menezes de mattos  I disagree. some parents dont discuss sex. how many kids have sex early without being entirely aware of the risks  sex ed should still occur in school  to discuss safe sex  stds  that kind of thing. many parents either dont or just teach that the best way is never doing it. how does that help anyone
@kamir aurelia  formerly aeonstaite   damn
unless its used as a synonym for gender
@tw o   yeah I guess I get your point. but there are consequences even if you have only the  ok  as long as you are dating and having prevention  is still not safe. cuz if you think about it  gf and bf is a very unstable relationship  and you have sex with your boyfriend girlfriend  you break up  and had sex  next time you also have sex  with someone who dated 2 other ppl  and had sex with both and on and on. and ppl often overestimate the efficiency of condoms. the only way that ppl can have safe sex not worrying about pregnancy in an unstable life or getting stds is to commit to have sex only after you exchanged vows and that is the person you now know  youre gonna have sex with the rest of your life. there wont be fear of stds  of pregnancy in unstable life  of break up once the sex made the bond grow and therfore the breaking of it became more painful  yes  Im aware most relationships 2day end in divorce but is not supposed to be that way. . so there s absolutely no advantage in any way shape or form  in giving an inch away from the  monogamy between man and woman having sex only after marriage  judeo-Christian sexual ethic. I still suggest you watch the jon mccray s video on sex outside of marriage. I would like to know what you think about the points he brings.  whaddo you meme the problem of sex w o commitment .  plus  I have a friend who used to sleep around and he said it tore his life apart and he immensely regrets it  he s okay now but itshows that the world today doesnt understand the seriousness of sex and treats as no big deal when itshouldn t
@vitor menezes de mattos  well there is also the point that the judeo-Christian sex ethic has its own problem which is that it causes some people to abandonthat very ethic because of how strict it is. and I agree it is a big deal  however some people are going to do it anyways  even with that ethic enforced. the sexual revolution didn t happen because society was too lenient. and now society views sex the opposite way. I just think there is a way to compromise without choosing one of the 2 extremes. allowing for the freedom of 2 adults to consent  but also incentivizing waiting until a stable relationship is formed.
@cloten candy  knowing how parenting is done these days its not hard to realize sometimes people are careless and allow for kids to be exposed to these questions at a young age  younger than the ages mentioned. now you can lie to them and tell them its not whatever it is  or you can simply just explain it in a way that is not sexual  not  creepy  but explains what they need to know without the mention of things they will learn as they grow. every human being is born with their  body parts  so its natural we get curious about it  but its ultimately up to parents to teach their kids about them in an appropriate way.
@jonathan w  I like terrible jokes  you just gotta put the joking sign att he end so people know
@amemiya nazuna virus  ear dmg incoming   what is the joking sign
@jonathan w  I dont remember the exact name or what symbol it is  sorry. I just call it the joking sign  not sure if thats correct.
it tells what hollywood is really about.
agreed  unless youre talking about the reproductive system
@stealthkillz311  go outside.
@deska diaz  when the child s parents decide it is time.
@the wise ninja troll  what if they never do it  that kid deserves to grow without that basic knowledge then
@deska diaz  above 16 would be ideal
so true
before ricky gervias there s george carlin.
no shit
is this anything like george clooney s speech
what did he say I forgot
been doing for decades look at all the disney stars quacks..all their mental breakdowns from being passed around as kids
@michael brown  what do you expect from a place that had a duck speaking with a lisp and running around in a sailor suit with no pants.
people allow this by defending shows like baymax and movies like strange world and lightyear. 2022 is the year disney decided they wanted to groom children. it took until today for many people s eyes to be open to that  but now it is laid out clearly before you.
@eprocto-files  what s wrong with baymax
Im glad to hear your say that  as I was getting concerned about my perspective.  before watching this video   and reading the first comments  I thought maybe they meant they wanted it to be real for an adult while being clean enough for a kid to watch.  I personally would want that  since it is rarely healthy for children to deal with the extremes as their brains try to understand the nature of human connection.melanie made a great reference when she mentioned that line  did you make love    eww  no  we just had sex.  that is not kid-healthy sex positivity.  I dont agree with kids finding out on their own how their bodies react to others because we re too afraid to tell them... but there needs to be some measure of fear.  some measure of shame and respect.  she-hulk had none.thanks again for expressing your opinion so that I can feel more assured of mine in the face of these extreme reactions.
you canthanks jews for the depravity
@shadowphoenix82  I d say my follow up question would be  why why did you have sex if you weren t in love  is that not just using another person for pleasure is that really what we want to impart onto our children honestly Ive heard predictions that the next generation might be ultra conservative to balance this kinda shit out and you know what I dont blame them.if this is the level of guidance our city chique lifestyle can offer them then I hope to God they rely on something more stable.
@dee em  they write whatever sells.its not their fault.they just exaggerate whatever it is we consume.
@jonathan farley  no  this would specifically be the alphabet crew. there s a lot of prejudice in their community toward the rest of the human population  the term is  breeders .
I dont shame anyone who wants to hook up. lots of people do. but let s not pretend that it doesnt have lasting consequences if its careless. children and stds can have a lifelong effect. the way there saying sex positive is so trash because never did we see condoms  or her worried about her partners being clean  or mention of birth control. just hey having a lot of sexual partners is something to be proud of. which is not healthy if your not in control. if your trying to be in a monogamous relationship the more partners your with the harder it is to stay monogamous. these women dont have the nuance to relay these topics in a positive way.
@jo  oh  you forgot the long term psychological damage that bad relationships dish out. sooner or later  sexual relationships inevitably involve the heart. and thats not even factoring in abusive relationships.
write a show  yeah  its disgusting  how dare they hire writers to give their character a first screen debut  shame on them!
@eprocto-files
remember him tweeting  hollywood stop f  king with kids
more and more people every day are seeing the truth ricky tried to warn us about.
@charlesws  thats not the weirdest thing Ive heard happen in an animated kids show pretty tame actually but still odd
it was factual then. thats why everyone got upset at him lolhe was in hollywood  he probably saw and heard about this shit going down. he knows it better than anyone here. so he turned it into a comedy bit that was actually true lol.
@jonathan farley  first off  I would never want to marry a virgin. nor would I want to be one before marriage. women are not promiscuous in any way  in comparison to men. what you are displaying is double standards.
@dee em  and you canthank dee em for the bigotry. hitler had a thing against jews as well. did you know you have such a close connection to old adolf
@jo  exactly! but I also think in a kids show  they need to promote healthy relationships. so many people today aren t getting married  there are more single and lonely men than ever and higher std and unwanted pregnancy rates. so even if kids chose hook up culture as adults  they aren t having it promoted to them as kids.
@dee em  bro wtf
I pretty much dropped the show because unlike these other people  Im not going to give it my undivided attention when I clearly dont like it. but if this is truly the case  and then this is clearly just a situation of very very bad lesson messaging rather than wanting to groom kids.funny the people who always claim the other side uses buzz words to the point where they have no more meaning are using a lot of buzz words to the point where they have no more meaning. I dont even know how to comprehend in what context she s using the word grooming in this video. because clearly its not the dictionary definition of the word at all. and itsure as hell isn t anywhere near the legal definition. which for anybody who stumbles onto this comment it just basically means the the semantic nature of the definition of whatever word youre using because when it comes to the law  you literally have to be very very very semantical and very very very specific. otherwise you either leave room for loopholes or the law is too vague and cannot be implemented. saying the legal definition does not mean there s a legal form of grooming. please do not twist my words in any form of matter.but yeah  if this is the case then I would agree. it just sounds like a very s    message to tell kids written by a very s    writers who have the writing skills equivalent to an edgy 12 year old who finally got the free time in privacy away from their parents to be able to cuss without getting in trouble.
@shadowphoenix82  as I said to the very first reply  if this is truly the case and I would agree. though I would just see it as very poor messaging of a very bad lesson rather than grooming like this site when the video above is playing. I dont think people saying this word even know what that word means anymore.but I would definitely agree that doesnt seem very sex positivity let alone not healthy lesson to teach anyone let alone kids when it comes to relationships.but like I said in my last reply  it just feels like its a poor lesson written by writers that have the writing skill equivalent to a 12 year old that thinks their edgy and barely figured out when to use curse words without getting in trouble with their parents.
Imean its not much of a suprise theyre pushing this narrative. Imean it was considered sex positivity and empowering to do of especially towards young woman
@dendrien thestrange  I remember when being a sugar baby was pushed online. girls swore up and down they just went on dates. then 5 years ago they started admitting the horrible things they had to do. it was so sad
@kamir aurelia  formerly aeonstaite   the statements I said should imply both sexes if it wasn t apparent.
@john ward     there are worse things said about the lgbt in this thread  it is however quite interesting whom you leapt to the defence of  I wonder why that happened
@ayaya farow  I guess we all get to pick our battles given the comments.
@alessandra jackson  yeah im not buying into had to do part. for starters majority today of prostitution is based earn more doing less instead of addiction issues or meet the ends meat. than again today we have an entire generation brought up with the lack of learning accountability. basically I do no wrong  im just a victime  its everyones fault mix with extreme optimism and vanity.
@dendrien thestrange  true
agreed.  you would think that  sex positivity  would include sexual awareness and safety precautions.  but nope.  it was all just an excuse for the writers directors to validate their own whorish behavior.
@john  yep! because yes sex is enjoyable and wonderful! purity culture has done more harm than good. but with the rise of infidelity  sexual abuse  stds and unwanted pregnancies .sex positivity has gone to an unhealthy degree!
exactly...its still a bad example to others.
@deadpoolx9  yes  but thats not really healing.  thats undulation.  oscillation.  the same with women becoming hyper-independent of men in response to breaking male oppression.  do I understand   of course.  is it the ultimate or even penultimate solution   of course not.  but eventually  hopefully in both issues  in all issues  we find balance in the generational undulation.
on the topic of current sexual issues in modern society  maybe a tad off topic  but the reddit ask women and twoxchromosomes pages are the worst places to see modern people discuss todays sex crazy society. the r women pages on dating men with ed are disgusting. most of these women have no sympathy for the condition and wouldn t consider dating a man with it. its all about how they receive pleasure. unrelated slightly but it is something similar that enraged me.
no
frr  she hulk is sooo good
someone need to teach her a lesson
yeah  this sucks. this show is perverted trash thatshould not be targeted at families.
@ricky uzumaki  anything in this show is worthy of someone squirming in their seat
its pretty much caligula in hollywood and its freaking in the hook up culture crap and my generation stuck in the middle of this shiz
@michael wills  exactly
1
seriously this  and they are give the example of comic about this topic which had underlying reasons or effects which this does not   but they dont care enough to look up the comics to see why people liked she-hulk
they use this in jessica jones season 2 I think! she was spiraling and just banging around and drinking herself as deep as she canto sleep. it was freaking crushing to watch too. but nope these people act like its nothing  shoot jen is a tragedy but is upheld as a hero...its weird.
daredevil also engages in this a lot  in the show he has one night stands but they always show that his relationships dont work out. the daredevil show does everything the she hulk show wanted to do  except it does it much better
totally agree...thatshows the disorder of their life.
the fact that casual sex is a thing in comics at all shows they ve had the wrong writers for a really long time.
@charlesws  casual sex is where we re drawing the line at what can be shown in comics or did you mean the mcu writers
imagine the child checking up megan the stallion since she was done lik a gud celeb in the movie and sees her songs which are almost softcore porn sad shit
women like them constantly see negative aspects they have are good while trying to control how others feel. they re weird
Ive only met one woman who said something like that unironically. they were depressed  alcoholic  and incredibly miserable.
@eisenzwerg  exactly.
Ive noticed this  this chick Im talking to  I hesitate saying  I wanna make love to you  I feel she might  think its too  boomerish  or gross.
@          !  you should say coitus to keep her on her toes
@finbar amaretto just make sure to have a good relationship agreement written out first.
its also weird because they would never praise a man for something like this
wdym reporting on these groomers has been a sport since covid
omg! get a room you 2 ! she  like all the other hater sites she hulk writers makes fun of  are doing this for clicks! nothing more  nothing less.
@ronnie patterson
@tom  lol riiight
@kamir aurelia  formerly aeonstaite   why so triggered
@ronnie patterson  thats an assumption and a cynical one at that.
uhhh  wym  seriously I dont get it @jennifer rinaldi
captain marvel
disney buyout and  reimagine tomorrow .
everything decays over time. orbits  food  even franchises.
I think before trump  nobody really cared how hollywood ran. but his tenure certainly caused a huge political divide that caused everyone and their dog to give hot takes on every damn platform  including movies.
people gave marvel a pass for their horrible movies for years then the activists came in and made it even worse but it was too late because marvel has an army of stans who will defend anything with the mcu brand attached to it
@pablo pesquera  did... did you just blame this on trump  hahahahaha!
you dont remember tony hooking up with the journalist  drinking on the plane with the stewardesses  sex has been a part of the mcu from the very beginning.
@15thobserver  im not blaming him for anything  im merely pinpointing when hollywood decided to go woke.
@idawg  maybe  can we recall if there were any marvel stans prior to 2016  I know there were massive amounts of normies.
@termite30  and a huge part of tony s character arc was how that billionaire playboy lifestyle was not a good thing. he had to grow up  take responsibility for his years of irresponsibility  and come to terms with the fact that his actions have consequences.
@james kester  I agree to a certain extent  I just know some people who were not into politics until 2016 happened. I certainly wasn t  until it affected the pop culture space.
@pablo pesquera  there definitely was a culture war before trump. what was unusual was that trump was used to justify the purging of internal critics so we started to see a different set of projects getting greenlit. trump certainly did not help but there definitely was a toxic trend for years before.
@gilmadreth  true but it didn t happen in just 1 film  took place over the course of several films. but you do make a good point. she-hulk doesnt really evolve much in this series  which is 1 of my main issues with it.
@termite30  indeed  character that never learn and grow are mind numbingly boring.
@termite30  yeah but after the fist film  tony was loyal to pepper. he may have had eyes on black widow at first before he found out thatshe was a secret agent  but he was only ever really loyal to pepper.
@termite30  but to be fair  tony learns a lot in the first film  so although he had to learn over multiple films  he still had a pretty satisfying redemption in the first movie
he s in on it  dont forget that.
lol nando v movies is pro she-hulk. although I dont even normally watch his channel. I was just searching for she hulk reviews and I found his. he basically glosses over all the problems with the show
@switchspark  thats so weird right  Ive heard women be more critical than men  I think some men are afraid to be critical of a show that comments so much on womens struggles so they just go  Im sorry about all you women go through  I feel your pain  and dont actually criticize the show
@sad child  yeah ikr  they re too afraid of the twitter mobs
unless we re counting health classes in middle school and up
its better if the teacher does it most parents will teach them its wrong and they ll end up developing issues later in life not being able to have a functional relationship becuase everytime they lay with another they believe they ve done something so terrible they cant be forgiving sex is a sensitive subject best taught by professionals
@Lordmunol  sex should be between those that have a serious relationship  even if they are not married. because having a bunch of one night stands have serious consequences  for both men and women.
@Lordmunol  no it isn t. teachers are now grooming. I dont trust them anymore. wake up man. we re in 2022. being professional doesnt mean anything anymore. look at all these professional teachers outing themselves as groomers. look at all these professional screenwriters making terrible shows. its all just a title. empty words with no substance.
@blacklives orblackvotes  its not happening where I live I only see it on youtube so I cant be that concerned about. all I say is sex is natural thing shouldn t be taught as a immoral and if taught in schools should be professionally also forcing your sexuality on kids is wrong and bringing to much attention to anything is not only bad its pretty stupid
@theanominous  thats why its important to talk about safe sex
@blacklives orblackvotes   fun  fact  a lot of these teachers aren t actually certified teachers but rather glorified substitutes  because there s a teacher shortage.
@Lordmunol  it not just physical health  but mental health as well. it also has a huge impact on pair bonding. why do you think the western countries are suffering from the highest divorce records in history
I agree completely with this. its been insane what these poor kids have had to deal with for far too long. and people wonder why all these young people have adhd  depression  and all these other mental disorders.  its being perpetuated everyday by hollywood and social media. we need to really boycott a lot of these movies   tv shows.  people need Jesus out here baaaaadd
thanks for being a voice for sanity in this messed up world
when popeye started out  it was a foul-mouthed sailor. when the writers found out that children read it  they toned down the swearing and cut out the sex.seeing that madame gao  play on the infamous way madame mao demanded politics in chinese art  knew that kids followed the show and decided to emphasize the sex is very worrying.
I wish I could end up with a woman like you melonie. what you talk about here is exactly why I have given up on dating entirely and just enjoy life in peace.
thank you for drawing attention to this melanie. I am roughly 20 years older than you at 55 years old. when I was growing up television still went off at 11 o clock to 12 o clock midnight and they always played the national anthem. there are only 3 to 4 channels to choose from. sunday night was the night that the disney movie special I would be on. my parents knew that they could sit me and my sisters down in front of the television and not have to worry because it was disney television and it would be safe for children to see. fast forward to the late 80s to the mid 90s and this is the time period that me and my wife are having children. we would go out and buy movies like the lion king or a little mermaid and we would set the kids down in front of it  knowing that we didn t have to worry about a thing because it was disney. and disney was always safe for children. today its gotten totally different because of people like this nut job directing and producing the she hulk series. disney is no longer safe for children just because it has disney s name on it. and make no mistake even though this is marvel  and even though some sex might be implied in marvel comics  people still think of these movies as disney. disney is the parent company  and there should never be swearing or sex or anything like that in a disney show or movie. I think that walt disney would roll over in his grave if you knew this. I dont know what walt disney s personal life was like but his company produced family  friendly and wholesome entertainment. I think that this is a palling to him and to the company he left behind. I am sorry for such a long rant  but I had to get this off my chest. God bless you  melanie and your family and friends. duane.
petition for all the prominent youtubers like melonie  quartering  nerdrotic  drinker etc to write and star in their own show! people would 100  crowdfund something like that. please make it happen.
new to your channel melonie and big fan already. its reassuring to hear voices like yours in these increasingly crazy times. Im a father of a 17 year old gamer girl and Im gonna introduce her to your content as I believe youre a great role model. keep up the good work. peace and love from the uk.
she hulk director  I wanted to make a sex positive show.also she hulk director  omits all the consequences of promiscuity from the show.
straight  from melonie today! you go girl! we are a sex crazed culture and we are so unhappy as a whole. yet no one seems to link the two.
once again...mel is speaking truths. love ya girl!  this is what Ive spoken loud about and then get called crazy. they are trying to manipulate   grooming  the children   needs to stop.
spiderman   she wanted to expose young children to what   ironman   I thought we were fighting world domination   hulk  she share hulk name...but he- hulk no share her bad ideas!!!
one word to describe who is the director  groomerone word to describe what the director pose to children  dangerone word to describe what the director is in law  criminalone word to describe what people needs to do to the director  arrestone word to describe the place the director needs to stay forever  prison
thank  you !!!melonie  my wife and  daughters  have now subscribed to your channel after discovering you on jeremy s  the quartering  channel.you have really been an awesome role model for my little girls and one teen daughter.you are such an amazing person and are such a great source for ladies to learn practically everything they need to to survive in this crazy new clown world.my eleven year old girl came home from school last week and started asking questions about  masturbation .wtf ! ! my tax dollars are funding the public schools.sad.
she-hulk - swipes right on all but the hottest men  engages in one night stands and wonders why she cant find a stable relationship.gao - this is positivity for kids.
we need to think of a positive-sounding term for someone  well  being foolish with their sexuality.  how bout just... sex positivity   brilliant!
I love ya melanie mac I agree with you on this topic big time. perversion is being more glorified than love these days sadly.
this reminds me of a line from the old sitcom  laverne   shirley  sitcom   I treat my body like a temple. you treat yours like an amusement park.  many people do see sex as a form of casual amusement thatshouldn t have any morality  any responsibility or any consequences attached to it. more importantly  people who think that they and  their group   defined by gender  orientation  fetish  self identification  etc.  have been unjustly oppressed for their sexuality believe that their  oppressors  have the unfair privilege of getting to engage in sex without a care in the world  and so they believe that they re just asking to be treated equally when they promote sex without boundaries. of course  that lack of boundaries they re pushing opens the door to all kinds of depravity  but when that happens  they dont dare condemn it because of a mindset of  I didn t care when they came for the _____  but then they came for me.
you aren t crazy melonie ...these people are straight up grooming.  they ve been doing it for years incrementally  mostly at disney and cartoon network.  its been ramped up the last few years  almost like they have a target date for legalizing p d0-feel-e-uh.
holy shoot  I never knew you were this deep and had such a refreshing philosophy on sex and life. not that I thought you were shallow  but this was definitely a surprise. I imagine I wouldn t be the only interested in hearing your views on this. Im a gen x  and I knew thatsmart phones had to be messing up kids with the easy access to pron. so hearing your in sight into the matter sounds crazy. keep up the great channel and Godspeed to you.
I just found out that I had a sex and porn addiction and it is not fun. its definitly getting better  but at first when Imet my love  I was hardly on the edge to cheat on him. thats a horrible situation to be in  especially when youreally love the one  but are so perverted by the industry and hookupculture that your mind always trys to mess with you. ive alway had that weird  its just sex  if no one finds out  itl be okay feeling  but it is not  and was never. ive worked so hard on it  and also try to skip porn. and luckily  im at a place where I can say  I never did it. we are almost 8 months a couple and I love him so much more and want a future with him.especially when you are a gay guy  this is so rare  cause gay people get horribly sexualized also in the industry  which I really despise.no matter the gender or orientation  this is never a good place for society to go to!
she is a monster and we know what she needs   lead
thats interesting I never knew about that even though I used to watch all the popeye cartoons years ago..even documentaries about it never mentioned that..
@jack straw  that was back in the newspaper days.
just... get a more conservative person
@tom  some of us live in a liberal bubble and are introverts.
@lawofimprobability  yes
if you are at all religious try going to church  good place to meet someone with similar morals.
this is why movies and tv have age restrictions on them. if you want  child appropriate  content look to the rating  not the company producing it. disney owns half of hollywood right now  so if everything they produced was child friendly they would be incredibly limited in the sort of material they could produce. disney venturing away from exclusively producing kid friendly material is a good thing  otherwise everything in cinemas streaming would be exactly the same. I haven t watched she hulk  I have zero interest to  but its rated tv-14. whether or not the content as described in this video is problematic to some  I dont see it being too much for a teenager to handle.
@luke ormsby  you get that common sense out of here... these people dont care about common sense.
@kamir aurelia  formerly aeonstaite
drinker is making a movie!!
100
makers of she-hulk  the only ones not liking this are incels!while she-hulk  cant get a date unless she turns green  even though she tries to date  which would make her a... you guessed it  incel!
you people exposing the widespread evil are heros in my book. much love.
100  agree. I always see people say stop sexualizing women and how men always objectify women but then turn around and use sex appeal to sell product or even themselves. this happens on both sides too even with men. its likely just another sign of the second coming of Jesus and we ve been told that people will be given up to their sins and living more and more deprived. I just saw a videos the other day where a guy was asking college student to sign a partition for a 5 yeah old to get a transition surgery because her parents said no it wasn t really but a social experiment to see if people would sign it.  sadly so many people said thatshe should be able to make that choice herself. like come on now most adults dont have themselves figured out and still discovering who they are and your telling me a 5 year old can make that choice. I bet if I said a 5 year old should have the right make the decision to get married  epically to someone older  people would freak out and say no thats wrong. its a double standard but because of that the limits get pushed to the point where people would think even the later is normal at some. its all grooming for sure and with each generation it gets pushed more and more. its truly sad and itseems to be the cookie cutter mold for most mainstream media.
thank you for talking about this melonie. this type of thing has clearly been bothering you for a few days  and I do hope maybe it reaches some people and helps them. the best advice ever  go to the gym!!!
I just found your channel and I have to say its refreshing to hear common sense and reasoning nowadays. great content.
thanks melonie  for being a voice of reason! Im subscribing since az introduced you as a wonderful person and a good game evaluator! thanks again.
when I was 9  I wanted to be a power ranger green . if a 9 year old says they want to he shehulk  turn off the tv and seek professional help.
I appreciate you and how represent yourself. its funny how the phrase  think about the children  has truly been lost morally. keep growing and keep speaking the truth. God bless you.
very good  that youre pointing that out. I dont know  what is happening right know  but these are world big companies who are poisoning us right now. whether it is intentional or a massive lack of self awarness  it doesnt matter  it is really just concerning.
you have a great message here mm.  thanks for speaking out  disney has lost its way no doubt.
I was very happy to hear yourefer to sex as a bonding  because it is. sex is meant to be between grown ass folks not children  its a special act between two people that love each other and want to express that love on the ultimate level. hollywood seeks to pervert this.
im glad our kids are figuring this out and pushing back even they are smart enough to see through this bs makes me happy
great video. there used to be a margin of understanding that no longer exists. one where an adult reference could be made and you would be certain most kids would not understand it  but their parents would. this no longer exists and we have increasingly less nuanced crappy writers. way way back in the day there was what is called  pre-code  movies. Im an older gent and to this day I cant even understand the saucy stuff octogenarians see in those old films. the internet and social media in conjunction with all the exposure people get today has squeezed this margin to nothing.
its honestly so refreshing to know melanie exists in this world.
the worlds sex and children should never be uttered in the same sentence or concept
it had come to mind recently on how technically creepy comics  video games and shows movies are when they have scenes depicting sex or nudity  even if  itshows nothing   between characters in high school. case in point riverdale  and invincible sure anime does it too  but 1. its a different culture  2. doesnt make it any less creepy. point being that the bad thing is that pushing sex   sex sells   has really become the norm to where they could push shows like she hulk on to kids and not bat an eye as to the message regarding sexuality it is sending to kids  mainly young girls.
more power to you melanie  need more voices like yours  God bless
sex positivity is being true to yourself and your partner. if you deeply care about somebody and they are the only one you wish to have sex with  thats sex positive. if two people find each other at a bar  have drinks  and decide to go into the bathroom and have sex  no strings attached  thats sex positive. if two friends trust each other and are attracted to each other  but aren t interested in living with that person but still have sex  thats sex positive.lying on dating profiles to get a hookup  judging the whole of a sex because of the actions of a few  discarding partners like tissues  that is toxicity. that is contempt  hate  and self loathing. that is the exact opposite of sex positivity.
melonie you are amazing. never stop speaking the truth. young men and women need a voice like yours.
thank you for this video melonie  I completely agree with you on this topic  another great video
that whole  there after your kids conspiracy  sounding more and more plausible
gender is easy to understand when you narrow it down to biology. it never became difficult until a decade ago when it became cool to confuse it.
completely lost it way
not buying it. as long as people treat frequency of sex as a measure of pleasure and treat pleasure as a moral imperative  it will always prioritize frequency over emotional support. sex positivity just puts an optimistic facade on what is a brutal numbers game to feel significant in the face of the void.
@lawofimprobability  that is more a cultural problem than a psychological one. consenting adults allowing their instincts and feelings to be vented in a healthy manner is natural. your mentality of making it a  numbers game  is a sad  cynical take on what is hardwired into every human being. there are too many people who treat it as a numbers game  but those people tend to be as vapid  misguided  and sad as jen from this show.sex is natural and biological. and  just like every other instinctual and biological process  ignoring or denying it only causes harm. what s important is that our sexual urges are satiated in a healthy  consenting manner. if they aren t  that can lead to some truly terrible psychological trauma.
@lawofimprobability  its just like the term  self love   which is a prettier way to say  narcissism   aka  pride . it only makes a mess of things  yet people always redefine it when people point the mess back to the origins.
thank youuuu! I actually thought it was a lot.. before the fact that kids watch this.. its setting some strange example as much as jen is a female protagonist where do the men of the mcu hook up with multiple people in any show... I just thought it was a lot. and I d feel the same if it was hulk. great vid!
let s read what was actually said  we always felt like there was a fear around sex and around the idea of sex positivity   coiro says.  so it was our job to keep having the conversation. we wanted to say  look  she s a woman in her 30s navigating modern life  sex is a part of thatstory  and  ask  how far could we go. let s read what the writer saidshe-hulk is easily one of the horniest shows currently streaming on disney plus  and for that  one of the most refreshing. but coiro says that her goal was still to deliver a show that could play to the broader  youth-skewing marvel audience. the director says she-hulk is the first show she s ever really worked on where she was receiving voicemails from 9-year-olds begging to hear what happened next. and her parents and friends who normally didn t watch marvel movies were hooked on she-hulk. there was a greater responsibility and challenge to make she-hulk be everything for everyone  without losing its commentary. let s read what the director said we wanted to make it realistic  and about a woman navigating sex  but also make itsomething that everybody can enjoy  including children  because there is an element of the show that is really fun for young people   she says. stop lying
6 32 - they probably dont even know what friendship is or how to properly show it due to the  they interacted and now its romantic  perception.
I agree with you ! this  woke  culture is getting way out of hand. I believe we need to stand up and say  enough!
I like your shirt by the  way  I wish l would have never went out like he did. but I like how much your speaking out of everything you feel. Im also happy to hear genz is coming around to it as well. hopefully we can get things back to a better time.
love to see ya melonie. love these videos
God bless this girl!
once upon a time  in a galaxy far  far away  media companies made movies and shows to entertain rather than to indoctrinate and push agendas.
yes  introducing the notion of f--kbuddy and casual sex to minors  how stunning and brave of her.is it just me or the entire segment of rich people has gone literally insane
you hit the nail on the head. users benefit from hookup culture.
God bless you melonie. this insideous  perverse agenda needs to be called out and opposed for the pure evil that it is.
cant get my head around why people actually protect this
keep fighting the good fight sister!  this is going to take all of us working together against our debaucherous and decadent era of history.
this would ve fit better if netflix still had some of the marvel shows. this would ve fit right in with the  heroes for hire  line of shows.
Im with you!!  today s left has become so perverse it is beyond me.  you  me  and the rest of us with common-sense need to turn this around  no doubt...and it is very important we do so--like now!  thanks for speaking out and looking-out for the young ones!!  never let go of your values!!  really digging your content!!  we got this!!...but lets just hope its sooner than later!plus   twould be great to get you on  timcastirl  to expand your audience--you d fit right in with tim pool and luke rudkowski!!
love it  melonie. thanks for speaking out.
always protect the children. great show! I cant believe they want to keep normalizing sex in  kids  content. they come out and say it.  how far can we push   smh
man I love that death note hoodie. I also agree with you. thankyou for calling it out!
we need more women like you and us guys would actually want to date women
I agree and thank you. I have neices and nephews. and they are sneaky with what they try to watch. and kids are smart with technology. so the safer the content the better outcome when they do go hunting for some they have no business watching. but around me Imake sure I watch em. lastly I remember when my folks would literally kick me out the living room over just a kissing scene. these kids now are allowed to see stuff I would have been thrown in my room for days for watching.
I dont think all rich people are like that  but the ones who are this way certainly seem to have gotten more depraved. makes me wonder if they ve always been this way  and just are being more open about it. either way its gross.
they re not smart enough to know how to speak against it  so they do it the easy way and conform.
Im saving this video because facts are spitting out too fast. my favorite quote   they cant even  woke  right.
I love your message ! you are so upfront!!!
sex positivity for kids. they ve never thought about what can kids possibly do with this. they cant just leave their innocence alone.
we need to protect our fandoms from these people.  so glad they cant get their hands on anime
love your channel keep up the hard work!!!
Im of the same opinion. this definitely should not be a thing. Im so tired of disney acting like they re sitting on a white horse when they re actually peddling this hedonistic lifestyle like its not flawed lol.
these people have no moral compass and think its cool and edgy. they are a cancer on society. when they start zoning in the kids it is a sure sign we a circling the bowl. there needs to be a substantial push-back and I see this starting to happen. people like melonie are front and centre in calling it out. your e doing a good job speaking up melonie  dont let up.
as a newly married guy  I dont think bringing a child into this world would be a good idea  like what would they be exposed to  even with good parenting  this is something going out of hands like for real!!
Ive been saying this for years and I still have people who think Im not being serious I was very unfortunate to have interacted with a person identifying as a map on twitter due to my being gay and being 100  against pedos and if people could see this conversation they would be as horrified as I was I even pleaded with these pieces of garbage  please for the love of all that is good in the world stop this and get help like I dont give a damn what someone is just leave people the hell alone and dont try and force it on people thats why people are growing to hate this movement even people like me and every time I say how toxic is itsomeone always has to say  oh well gamers are toxic too  yes but they aren t destroying each others lives for differing opinions ffs.
ok we will agree to disagree on lotta what you said but the one thing I will agree with you on is this. no one should be trying to push the subject of sex on kids! thatshould be the parents job anyway! sadly though  a lot of parents are not teaching this so they end up learning it from other sources that dont have the best interest in mind.
I like to think those voicemails the head writer received were just her calling herself like some f   ed up character from a de palma flick.edit  pray for gen z.
I dont know if you ll see this  but your makeup recently has been on point! Im finding myself in awe whenever I click on your videos  lol! just wanted to put that out there.
there are sometimes women in comics who dont respect themselves but they are either clearly there as a warning  like drug addicts who resorts to prostitution or they are in a bad place as a part of a larger arc thatshows them getting help and struggling but succeding to get better in the end. back when there was still comics code approved books they didn t depict neither killings or sex.
refreshing and bold takes. keep it up sister in Christ
going to the prom movies were not entirely about sex
the most character growth she got was from a bunch of villains. thats how effed up jen is. also apparently she didn t actually learn anything about how badly she was living life.
you talk a lot of sense when it comes to the incel issue.  I agree we should help icels to become less antisocial  by teaching them  to be more responsible  helping to devlope social skills   and to get rid of that  victim mindset.  we need to help incels to think more rationally and to take control of their own lives  instead of blaiming other people for their own shortcomings.
at first  when she said it benefits users  I thought she meant users of the dating apps. and my mind went  well of course the dating apps dont have a vested interest in you finding a life partner  because then you wont use their app anymore.
18 years ago I got a disability that makes me disgusting to be around.18 years since Ive felt the touch of a  woman.Im still alive.these people act as if sex is oxygen.
you go girl
agreed

their trying tho but the japanese aren t going to let them
@danny stelly  thank God
ugh  sorry you have to deal with that. praying for ya  thats gross.
@anjie  if people could just see that they would see why that if we ignore them that no they aren t just going to go away its like a tumour it will only get worse with time if you leave it in which is a perfect analogy for this.
exactly. all these parents on the right who also dont parent their kids  even if they do  homeschool  them  are blaming everything else  but themselves when their own kids dont turn out right instead of actually teaching their own kids right from wrong. kids who learn that by themselves through other means always grow up with a lot of issues.
@shane douglas  well in that episode itseemed like she had some. but I think they forgot about it immediately after.
@david smith  trust me  they did forget about it because they dont know the meaning of character development...
imagine the backlash if a man said he wanted to make a sex positive show for the kids
its funny that when its a show with a female main trying to sleep around its  sex positive  but if it was a male character how many screams of misogyny would we hear
I wish we could just sit people down sometimes and set up some kind of truth field and just ask  do youreally believe what you are saying
Im glad their are women to show these females wassup  and trust me their is a big difference  I dont want my sisters being like this  I want them to find real love and for themselves to respect themself
I just realized she-hulk is trying to be like those cw dc tv shows  where almost every episode  someone is in bed with someone else  but they tried to keep that marvel quirkiness  but utterly failed
my ma went into an italian restaurant and ordered a sandwich to go and the guy that took her cc used it to buy  100 on only fans. when she told me she thought the restaurant ordered cooling fans for their establishment.
my body s a temple!the universe  nah  youre more like a waffle house bathroom.
the feminists say things like  free the nipple and I want to sleep with how many men I want. but then if something happens like if she gets pregnant its the mans fault for not keeping it in his pants.Imean like  sleep with how many people you want  its your life. but dont say that men should have kept it in their pants when something happens. you are just as responsible for it.
why do I feel like in the far future when everyone in our generation is gone  the age limit for kids to be considered adults will just go lower
a very refreshing video. thank you. I think the future has hope now
awesome work  calling this crap out. my family cancelled disney  when the internal zoom calls came out and I can see that nothing is changing over there  so we are not ever going back to a company that is generating this garbage.
zex  and  kidz  in a same sentence always had bad endings
something tells me the director wont get hired by disney again
the ending of this video is very powerful
anyone remember the episode of friends where phobie goes on a date with a guy that writes questionable books and she walks out  I think we are become a world we re if that episode was done today she wouldn t leave but marry him instead
its totally possible to write a selfish  promiscuous  sex-positive female character who is genuinely fun  charming  and likeable. isabella from dragon age 2 comes to mind. the main difference between isabella and this particular version of she-hulk  however  is that 1  isabella doesnt take herself seriously at all  let alone give into angst  and 2  dragon age 2 is an m rated game  and thus not aimed at a family audience.
she hulk had more hook ups than any reality show could ever dream about. she basically was clueless thatshe was being used too.
you know what would be a lot more interesting  here s an idea  have jennifer be married. they want to go in the bedroom  show jen and her husband having to adjust to her being 6 foot 7 and super-strong. that would be far more interesting than this dum-dum being an update of the cathy comic strip. believe me  a married jennifer would be getting more bedroom time than the jennifer of the series  or the jennifer of the comics  for that matter .
I loved the mcu for the stories and those went down hill. I stayed for the potential and that never came. this is straight up horrendous this is intended for families with the exception of some things here and there. like I grew up with this stuff if this came out when I was younger my mother would have turned the tv off and never watched it again. like I thought the press around the scene in eternals was bad enough.
hImelonie I wanted thank u for everything you have done for your chanel.I always enjoy seeing your videos the way u give your thoughts  opions are refreshing.takecare melonie
damn right
its good to hear a young female like melonie expressing the opinion that getting three different men in bed in less than two weeks probably isn t healthy. I thought it might be just me  born in the 1960 s and male who thought that.
I remember when this project was announced  and I was like oh cool a show I can watch with zoe   my 5 yr old daughter   then I heard about what some of the episodes were like...oh its just a show  for narcissists  she doesnt sound heroic or inpsiring at all.
she hulk is definitely not like this in the comics or cartoons.
refreshing  is imo used when you think something is obviously crap  but you dont want to admit it.
we are failing these children bruh I actually feel horrible
you are a gem for any man looking for true love life partner
this is how you cantell the people making these shows and movies dont get it. the comics never discussed the characters  bedroom life . sure they had one but comics aren t about sex and romance they re about fighting  detective work  good vs evil etc.
you cantell that fall is here when melonie isn t wearing the spaghettI straps.
they seem to forget who actually pays for the disney  subscriptions in most households. this will not go down well on top of the disrespect they have already shown the fans. this takes it to a whole new level. how did the netflix  cuties  debacle or g4tv constantly insulting and berating their audience work out for them respectively
defenders insist this is how she hulk always was. I remember she hulk being sexy and flirty in the comics and cartoons  but does anyone remember her being the village bicycle  I sure dont.
I agree  there was nothing positive about that aspect of the show  or any other aspect for that matter . and yes  we need to be more sacred.
this push to make things  sex positive  for children is sickening. they re children. they need to be allowed to be young and stupid. they dont need to know anything about sex. I cant even imagine what kind of trauma the rising generation is going to have to deal with as they become adults being introduced to this too early.
before hearing this bit of news  I thought that mulan 2020 was the genuinely worst thing disney was responsible for. now  I hate that I cant say Im still sure.
its one thing to have a marvel show geared more toward an older audience  just dont pretend this is for kids or even think for a second its appropriate and healthy for em.
its really important to teach kids the consequences of sex at a young age. I had it at third class in elementary school. of course there were the chuckles  but we did learn how to be serious with that topic. its absolutly irresponsible to pretend its not a thing. teaching   censorshipthatsaid  marvel is something for all ages. she-hulk was basically a sitcom and hookups are pretty common in that kind of genre.
the producers and writers will do anything to defend this show now.
4 53 I think the pivotal moment in the whole series  the single bit that told you everything  was when the guy made a reference to  making love  and jen went   ew.  if you have any doubt  this should tell you right there that jen is a horrible person. from their interviews  its evident that jessica gao  kat coiro  and tatiana maslany approve of this attitude. if someone can find something to disprove this  please let me know  but right now  I have no respect whatsoever for any of these women.
groomer s gonna groom.
7 18 nine-year-olds left voicemails to the director begging to know what happens next....I ll take  things that never happened  for  200  please  alex!
you are amazing thank you calling this filth or what s wrong with these people
not well
same here
she hulk isn t a kids show  they made that very clear with its themes  so why its now considered  for kids  is strange. also  as you said  its supposed to be comedy  not education. this isn t them teaching anyone anything  this is them being perverted for the sake of it. also  just because its  a part of the culture  doesnt mean kids should be learning about or involved in it. if you think so  please dont have kids.
imagine getting fired or sued for sexual harassment because you complimented someone or maybe touched their shoulder while people are teaching your 5 year old what sex and genitalia is. have wood chipper  will travel
she-hulk isn t a super hero show. its a normal show where the main character happens to have powers. she straight up doesnt want to be a superhero.
it all started decades ago with  sex education.  now you see what happens when you taint the innocence of children.  that is also when school systems and teachers started acting like they had the right to step in and teach other people s kids topics because  well  the parents should be teaching this but since they wont....
if a woman has a long line of boyfriends or worse sleep with different people often I avoid her like the plague as she obviously is not interested in a genuine relationship.I am nearly 40 and I have never asked anyone out many of the women I know have had underage sex and or got pregnant underage or very young. sex is not seen as important just a bit of fun but not me I would rather die a virgin than sleep with a woman I am not in love with.
I think this is your best video yet. but to answer your question  yes it is intentional that they send a bad message to kids.
shehulk is what psychologists define as a covert narcissist. they bet themselves up and have a low self esteem  try to act kind  love being pitied  and then project their shortcomings on others  and create rules for everybody to follow using emotional black mail and shame  and immediately break them themselves then double down. they take your arguments and use them as a weapon against you. she hulk appeals to narcissists. people need to keep calling this crap out. dc went through this exactly with  Im not starfire  the sensational shehulk was a greta book  please read the 90s stuff  not the crap marvel wrote in the past 10 years for jen.man jen was a great older sister kind of character for hulk. she was sexy she was fun loving and not a wh   that came later.even the agenst of smash version  as whiney as she was was cooler. the fantastic four animated versions were fun. and melonie  keep being the voice in the wilderness calling  john the baptist   unlike many people who keep asking you to be nice  was a man who spoke truth  he paid for it but his words were heard  and he did not say ... amma head out yall   off.kinda hope melanie reviews the chosen since season 3 is comin up. stir the waters!
I was a bitsurprised by the amount of sex and alcohol use there is in this series.
remember this is the same broken jen walters thatsaid she was  infinitely better  at handling anger   emotion than hulk was.
every time these she-hulk people open their mouths  Im like  stop. talking.
this show didn t break gender stereotypes  it enforced them.
so her favorite superhero movie is ant-man  because itshows a lot of  moundain  everyday life bits  in it. why am I not surprised I bet her favorite food is pizza  because it has a lot of crust on it and crust tastes like bread!
getting absolutely beyond ludacris for sure!  stand up ! great job addressing this.
I just found your channel and you are amazing
I agree that this is was sick Imean right up until the end and especially with the director s statement about wanting kids to be invested in this and the signal that itsends to kids watching it is basically that its ok to sell your body over a simple compliment and that you should scorn anyone who says one bad thing about you. that is the underlying message that I picked from this show and it is just wrong.
in olden days a glimpse of stockingwas looked on as something shockingnow heaven knowsanything goes- cole porter cheers.
whooooaaaa... polygon is still a thing also  why re so many people these days wanting to talk sex with my kids without me knowing about it  seems kinda pervy  if you ask me...
Im usually optimistic but lately Im not sure our society is going to make it.
the writer of the show actually managed to enforce almost every negative stereotype for women... as a women herself.
you know back when I was fighting for my country.... I just never thought I was fighting for a country that would turn into this
okay  it may have been hard for me to get into at first  but if you want a hilarious  recent  mean-green show with great action that kids can watch check out rise of the teenage mutant ninja turtles.
amen to that.
I plan on checking it out
I think even jimmy saville would be surprised by this.
3 22 - omfg melonie is just way too cute  I know its a serious point she s talking on but she s just way too adorkable right there.
on netflix I watched the whole season of she ra thats rated y7 for kids and I couldn t believe what I seen in the seasons of she ra it blew my mind. it has  guy on guy and girl on girl relationship scenes and bestiality scene. they re forcing these things into these kids minds. even the cartoons I used to watch as a kid has been changed and thatstuff is in it now  most people would think this is normal to me its disturbingcartons are becoming unsafe for children to watch.
I would have had more respect for the writers if they just made  she-hulk in the city  instead.
she-hulk is sex positive  if treated as a cautionary tale
thanks for standing up against this stuff.
I liked ant man so ..........kids should like having sex! .....I liked ant man  too. how do you have this job
someone search her hard drive.
youre awesome thanks for good content not vile bullshit
I thought for marvel to maintain quality story based on the source material it had to be on hulu.  but it is on disney .  seeing the idea that comic books and star wars are for children  with no thought of the adult content in each  makes it clear that moniker of devil mouse is accurate to the disney corporation.
what the hell happened to society after the 80 s and especially the 90 s.
predators  this is what the prison system is really for!
I know  epstein  was your friend  but I dont care! - ricky gervais
its almost as if disney waited for stan lee to die before they can do all this ridiculous shit to marvel ips. everything before infinity war was taken seriously im pretty sure out of respect for stan lee and he was still alive and all that. disney probably thought now thatstan is not around  they can just do what they want and completely go off the rails.
damn love how the colour scheme of your twitter matches with your nails
truly  thank you and amen sister.
in the comics  the she-hulk comics that barely sold we suppose acknowledge that
look there is a happy median we need to find between one night flings with multiple partners and saving yourself for marriage. neither are ideal  especially nowadays  you might think youre marrying a person of the opposite sex but get a surprise on your wedding night.
best bet is to prepare yourself for the realization that  your favorite actor singer celebrity  is in on some dastardly business after hours. eyes wide shut is a documentary
not to sound like a pearl-clutcher - but normalizing promiscuity increases depression  increases unwanted pregnancies  can damage future relationships  retroactive  jealousy    makes it harder to leave unfulfilling relationships  because lust can be conflated with love   increases the likelihood of contracting an std  and can lead to more single parent homes that are less ideal for raising children. science matters.
why do you think Im never letting my kids watch that garbage if I ever have any
disney is but people. people probably held off the worst proposals when stan lee was there to quietly refuse but those without his clout probably have a harder time resisting the  bright ideas  that keep on getting proposed.an under-rated part of leadership is the nerves to refuse a proposal that looks good on paper. that is why margaret thatcher was famous for calling some politicians  wobbly   as in wobbly at the knees when people get nervous .
seems like it...
remember when people were mad about a couple adult jokes during a movie that would just fly over a kids head  or phallic symbols in the artwork of some of the films I dothose were disney movies.this is still disney and its absolutely terrifying!I dont have kids  but if I did they wouldn t have access to disney unfortunately. I say unfortunately because there are some real gems that disney has made in the past  especially for kids. parents jobs never end with having to monitor all this stuff.
youre an amazing woman  she-dunkmy admiration grows by the daycontinue to love you some Jesus
the numbers the show produce make it very unlikely she was getting so much support. she hulk was recieved horribly.
well this guarantees that there wont be a second season. kids cant watch r rated shows
they re not even hiding it anymore
alcohol is a part of most people s adult lives  hopefully with moderation  but I wouldn t want someone making an alcohol-positive show for kids.
ps the lostprophets frontman would definitely be a woke singer. their ideologies match. basically  aim for the children .
I thought you were only about butter. Im glad to see its more. lol
hImelanie  I admire your morality alot and I would like to know your comments on thatshow euphoria  that digusting hollywood product  where teenagers used drugs and have sex. its a show about teenagers for teenagers  that is rated mature.
addicted to corn...  ...I love you.
remember when heroes caught the bad guys those were the days
this is what happens when a society becomes a Godless one. evil just runs rampant. dont let it get you down hun. just remember that good always wins in the end.
I pray to God everyday for a sensible women like you come into my life  so tierd of the average leftoid femenists  in my late teen years but I am going full schinzo honestly  have traditional people gone extinct
yes  your body should be treated as sacred   -  lets someone doodle on your skin with needles
9 year olds definitely did not call her asking what was next  lol
great take  melonie!
lol  they cant even woke right .
I am positive my son s sex is male.  I am positive my daughter s sex is female. did I do sex positivity for kids correctly
what s it gonna take to get ya on an episode of fuseboxx engaged
100  on point. excellent video.so glad I found your work! saw your interview with colin moriarty. keep up the good work  melonie!
I feel you
laughing in crusades and holy spanish inquisition
@marco genovesi  fun fact  more death and human suffering has been committed in the name of atheistic humanism than any misguided religious crusades.
Im an atheist and I dont wamt this for the kids.  even if Im not bounded by any religion  common sense and morality is the greatest thing to have.
@norman readdis  absolutely. well said sir
@norman readdis  mark 16 16whoever believes and is baptized will be saved  but whoever does not believe will be condemned.
@icepicjoey  not really  they were a cash grab justified by religion
@fillwithheart   citation needed
@norman readdis  Godless people are evil apparently
@sean guinn  if God is an ever loving entity  he will never condemn someone that live the same as his teachings because most religions shares the same goal and Christianity alone is not the sole religion existing  they re most likely just sect groups of followers that made rules differently but with the same end goal. because if he do. he s not a benevolent God but a conquering ruler. Im a former catholic acolyte and then I realized we are the sheeps being herd by the sheppard while buddhism is all about inner peace.I d rather search my inner peace than being herd like a cattle.
@sean guinn baptism is most likely the convertion to a religion  a cleansing and adoption of some sort. if youreally understand the real meaning or purpose of what s inside the book that youred memorize  baptism is not the way to salvation.some religion use fear for people to do good and repent. its not really teaching on how to search for one self as good but to prepare for judgment by the whip of revelations.rather be faithless knowing what s right than being religious but blinded by faith.as long as people never step on someone  never meant any harm and keep things rational and in good faith  they ll be weigh accordingly.
@norman readdis  in my experience religion  or absence of it  is tangential to morality. in either case the individual finds a way to justify whatever morality he has  be it good or bad  with either religion or some other phylosophical atheistic concept.thats one of the main reasons why I think religion is bs. its something Ive seen bent in one way or another or yet another opposite way to justify the most different things. if its not even a consistent dogma wtf is it really.
@marco genovesi religion is just a different sect group that is created within the culture to achieve the same goal. most people forget that its a guideline not a definitive life in servitude. knowing your conviction is enough as long as you do it properly and make life better. most are too focus on faith for their deliverance that God had created them with a purpose not just pray for him 24 7 expecting a change. people need to work to make thatsalvation a reality.  if he want us to pray that much he shouldn t have bring us on this world where pending for survival is a must and just be angels instead.action speaks louder than words. he gave us free will  a brain to think  feet to walk  arms to work  eyes to see  ears to hear  heart to understand. all that gifts are nothing if not use properly. we re no Gods creation if we re slaves to faith.
@marco genovesi  - - sir  itseems you are giving me the same impression you think Im doing. that is to quote you   ignore the parts of history you dont like so you can believe some fantasy thing makes you better than anyone else . Christians are not some monolithic bloc. alas  protestants in germany s north were more pro-nazI than catholics or the few orthodox. and I wasn t combining labor camps and death camps. never implied that at all.
@baystateobserver  no Im telling you how it is  you are the one ignoring parts I never said na zI didn t have norse influences
@marco genovesi  - - no  sir  I didn t say or imply that you did. not once.
sacred buildings dont have murals and artwork  you ever seen a catholic cathedral
@anjie  I wasn t aware buildings had nerve endings  could scar and be infected. apt comparison
@ragnakak  its an apt comparison when you look at it metaphorically. the Bible describes our bodies as temples of the holy spirit  which is why we are to treat them with respect. but that doesnt mean we cant decorate our skin. I assumed that melody was pulling the idea of sacredness from the Bible since she s a Christian. I wasnt suggesting that catholic cathedrals are living. I assumed it was clear that Imeant it metaphorically. my bad.
reeeeeeeee! u kant say dat ur gendur z nut ur sekz reeeeeeeee! from the perspective of people who aren t completely insane and or abominable  you are factually correct.
we want to teach kids about sex and everything thats involved. we aren t groomers we swear.
she-hulk is one the most horniest show   she said that !
God creating a hollywood directors 2 drops of creativitya glug of  men are bad liters of diversityand a gallon of grooming
this is why Im afraid to have two little girls because of people like that
burn it all down!
as things go more commercial  they must play up to the messages of the day. so instead of always asking favorites to stay the same. we should find new media and shows that are showing promise. the walk away theory. as a libertarian I like that idea instead of pretending we own any of these properties. maybe even bollywood has a good series worth getting behind.
why did it take a blind man to finally like jennifer   what does thatsay   or doesnt daredevil already have several romantic interests in his own series
you get my like... thanks for calling out this bs
preach  melonie!
melonie mac makes a new video I instantly hit the like button before video starts
just because you see your body as sacred doesnt mean we all share those beliefs. hookup culture has its place and so does long term relationships.my problem with the show aren t the hookups  which is not disrespectful . its the shit writing.
history repeats  because we dont learn from it . the  free love  of the 1960s proved to have the same emptiness that hookup culture has now. and here we are again
the she-hulk director has what they call in prison  short eyes .even career criminals hate other criminals with thatsick disgusting label to their character.Ive heard their days are numbered was the other inmates get wind of it.I guess you could say that even criminals now despise marvel executives and employees.marvel is just horrible now.
me as a kid  church is way too tight lipped  society isn t that bad!me as an adult  yall need Jesus
I would argue that  hookup culture  is not just for users. but the difference between healthy  hookup culture  and what youre talking about is two-way understanding and consent  and self-love and respect. its healthy if that is what both partners want and express openly. for instance  some people who identify as aromantic may still experience sexual attraction and want that experience. just like any dating situation  it just needs to be communicated.back to the video though  yes  what she-hulk promotes is way out of line and not healthy for every reason you pointed out. its as you said   people take it too far . people have taken real  genuine sex positivity and pushed it too far. and targeting children is just ..no. 9 year olds do not need to be thinking about sex  especially not through adults targeting them!
its sad how this generation is letting their minds be controller by the media that we ve always known doesnt want what s best for us  and some influencers are just spreading the message that all this is fine when any logical thinking person would tell you its not  who in their right mind can believe advertising sex to kids is a good thing  and some of the people who attack you and defend things like this are the same ones who were calling for twitch to have an adult only page months ago but they are ok with a kids show on disney doing this  and let s be honest this is hollywood we re talking about so you know it wont even be safe sex  it will be like you said just  having fun  because thats all they care about.
I love popular stereotypes  because they remind me of the very exact same people condemning stereotypes that are popular with me  and used to be popular with the majority of people .like the popular  incel  stereotype that makes a whole class of people fair game for abuse and denigration.not every  incel  is as you describe  and women turning into harridans and hypergamous hags have to accept some of the responsibility for the creation of at least some incels.Ive known men who weren t able to get laid  who were awkward around women  and who ve given up on getting one for themselves  and are therefore involuntarily celibate... they dont fit your description at all. they certainly dont hate women as a class  as an idea. they just hate the current model year.  analogy  I think all cars made in 2022 are ugly  except reproductions of previous models... that doesnt mean I think all cars are ugly or that I hate cars per se. it does mean Ive stopped shopping for a new one .I really haven t encountered these malevolent fanged demons you call  incels .
I love corn. canned corn  creamed corn  corn on the cob  and corn chowder.
the world is certainly nosediving at this point.
I always thought sex was positive  but I am a male  go figure .  I also knew a lot of females in middle and high school that thought it was positive  and many who thought it was negative at the time .  adults generally believe sex is a positive thing in their life.so  is there goal to get the people who didn t want to have sex in middle and high school to have more sex  get pregnant  then have an abortion so that we can make sure those clinics can make money  after all  abortion is big business
you might not share those beliefs  but that doesnt mean youre correct in your beliefs.every human has intrinsic worth  made in the image of God. thats an objective fact  not a matter of opinion. therefore  everybody has a body thats sacred. those who dont see this truth haven t awakened to real truth yet.
@otterloopb  God isn t real. that is a fact. you cannot prove your imaginary friend is real.
@jimmer  you are true bot
sex is like fire  in a fireplace  marriage   it will keep your house warm  anywhere else and it will burn your house to the ground. these people  particularly  disney  are standing in the smoldering remains of their homes  telling everyone how beautiful it is and how everyone should have a house like theirs. so glad I canceled disney . no more dollars for disney!
why the f    would I become something better to attract something worse  Im already way beyond what these girls are. if I self improve anymore I ll be going on my 20th lap around them. and besides that why the f    would I pander to women s desires when they cant even be bothered to not snide through their teeth when I give the request for a back rub  or the fact thatsomebody who is a couple inches taller than myself comes by and shows her a little bit of attention then she s out the door like the door was never even there. it d be comical if it wasn t so tragic to watch a human run through a door similar to a deer running through a glass window because it cant see it.
of gurls   I cant find a man! also of gurls   we need to make content to keep men at bay! corn positivity cant exist because there is nothing positive about corn - it just leaves dudes drained and leads impressionable women into selling themselves. and trying to take something like a super hero  which kids watch  and make it corn-positive for kids  well... I d say some holes in minecraft need to be dug so that these corn-positive players can be properly minecrafted in them.
I was done with she hulk with the hulk twerking scene
kids should not be exposed to this.  if the reason why needs to be explained  then there is something deeply wrong with the people who dont understand.
another thing that enraged me about current sexual society is places like the r women pages on dating men with ed are disgusting. most of these women have no sympathy for the condition and wouldn t consider dating a man with it. its all about how they receive pleasure. unrelated slightly but it is something related to current sexual attitudes that enraged me.
I hate to break it to you guys  but by watching this show to see how shit it is  you are still watching it  and thereby supporting the creators. the best thing is not to give the creators the controversy they seek  but to completely tune them out and ignore them. its like a barking dog behind a fence. dont ask why its barking. just walk by like it doesnt exist.
ya know what they say..  sex sells
I get that disney try to be accommodating to multiple characters and audiences  but what happened to remaining family-friendly ! they couldn t do thatsimple thing with disney  I ll gladly watch re-runs of gummI bears  ducktales and  heck  even freaking house of mouse - but I ll stick with whatever subscriptions  I dont need a disney  account right now. . . .
these people have enclosed themselves so much that they ve lost touch with reality
I genuinely think the anecdote from the director lady about 9 year olds leaving her voicemails about the show was entirely made up. first of all  where are they getting her phone number from  and what 9 y o would bother doing that with the director of the episode show  none of that makes sense  aside from potentially those kids  parents forcing them to leave those vms if that actually did happen. but I gotta agree with melonie  I dont see how anything featured in the show could be considered  sex positive  unless they mean thatsex is absolutely featured in the show. what was shown was entirely given negative effects on jen or the story  except for jen daredevil. jessica jones did it much better.and for what its worth  I still think melonie has an unreasonable hate lady-boner for this show.
something very basic thatself-centered activists simply refuse to grasp... the words  sex  and  kids  should never be in the same sentence.  ever.
preach!!!!
im sorry to all the kids out there that really do have to endure all of this shit. growing up I had sarah connor  ripley   just badass female and male heroes in the 90 s 00 s. this show was made to essentially point and laugh at audiences and non-believers of their message. I really do want this lunacy to stop and fuck off away from entertainment  politics and all other forms but if we are stuck with it  we need to have good people leading the charge with enough support to drown out their stupidity and frankly  narcissistic trends.
if half of the shit they call its for sex positivity would ask if youre 18 just like porn its a weird double standard
100 percent correct on this  melonie.
so Im guessing we aren t getting a melonie mac onlyfans anytime soon
as someone who was a kid less then two years ago I can say that this isn t something I would want to watch  I would be incredibly grossed out and confused why my parents made me watch a tv show about a selfish arrogant lady who treats peoples role models like trash  this show has been a detriment to she hulk as a brand and a character.
lonely people do need an outlet  trust me xd
73.1k when I joined   idk how I haven t came across you sooner.  hoodie if fire as well !
yup
consequences like trauma  being left as the only parent  being bad examples for the children  etc that everyday women face shows  sex postiviity  aka sexual immorality aint the way
I wholeheartedly blame a lot of corruption of the youth on the cw. all of their shows after supernatural have been nothing but sex  drugs and confusion. they took one of the most wholesome and modest characters from the 1960 s nancy drew. and turned her into a hormone raging sarcastic toxic sexual deviant  its a travesty honestly
where is chris hanson when we need him.
melonie doesnt like sex and kids  future adults  should remain ignorant thats my take from here.aside from that the show is all but sex positive when itshows how detached from feelings the character is  nothing wrong with casual sex but she overdoes it.
jennifer walters is way too neurotic compared to her comic persona  where she is strong woman in either form.  compared to baggage the hulk has  she s one of least messed up marvel heroes.
within 3-4 years the world will accept that kids around 8-10 will have sex and see it as a normal thing  atleast at this rate
I have a daughter and agree 100  with melonie!
I think was  funny  that in the marriage episode they dind t actually show the wedding
we cant let the perverts win... it also starts with the parents too... these new parents these days are just too soft and they dont care about what their kids do...
Im glad people are waking up. Im sure they knew it already but didn t want to bother. but now since they re so intrusive they re taking action. finally we ll get rid of this woke shit
I shudder to think what they are going to do to the teletubbies.the horror  the horror of it all.
Im getting old and Im old school in language and thought. what does  sex positivity  mean  I do know this however  its always been about the children. they want sex with kids and they want that to be normal. its been obvious to me for 25 years or so.
you tell em melonie!
I dont think hookup culture is about users. users may abuse hookup culture  but I think that hookup culture itself is good for people who enjoy sex.
the two most recent things marvel has produced  thor love and thunder  and she-hulk have both been geared towards kids while also being heavily saturated with sexual content.   disney marvel aren t even trying to hide the fact that they re groomers anymore.   blatant pedophilia agenda.on a positive note  it makes me proud as hell to learn there are tons of gen-z kids out there fighting this garbage and trying to turn it around.   you usually think things only get progressively worse with each new generation but some of gen-z out here proving the world wrong.  I love it.   they may be our only hope.
I have lost all hope in this world. morality is dead  genuine connections with people are impossible to make  I dont trust anyone anymore out of fear that they have some hidden agenda.  I hardly even know what to believe anymore. I dont know what to do with life anymore.
maybe  we shouldn t  worry  about this  kids seem to do the opposite  of what they re parents do  so when the next generation  grows up  they want have sex. it will probably be scene as something not worth their time  or its something  disgusting. wait thats happening now.
rules for thee but not for me  kat coiro
thats rich coming from polygon  I swear I read from polygon that one thing the cyberpunk 2077 sequel could improve on is less sex advertisements. which in a world like cyberpunk actually makes sense since its a parody of consumerism and the game is meant for adults but when it comes to a show like she-hulk which normally marvel would be family friendly they just say  yaass queen slay so sexy so powerful  get that bag! . pathetic.
despite this being depraved thinking from the she-hulk creators that it could be for kids  their show doesnt even have any positive representations of sex. its all unhealthy behaviors.
madame you ve gained a subscriber because your making to much damn sense lol
sex positivity  is different from  selling sex  to kids. kids should be taught thatsex is beautiful  when consentual and performed responsibly  and no one should be embarassed about it or shamed for it. that being said  I dont think she-hulk did a good job of sending that message. this show was a self-indulgent mess  not just for jen  but for the writers.
they have to be referring to young teens when they say children  Im surprised most people dont see it that way based on how the comment section is warring rn. guys  if you can finish the show you absolutely hate with your life  you cantake time out of whatever youre doing to read between the lines and actually use your heads.
I do read smut stuff like anime girls  but I also go to the gym whenever I have time so I got a good balance between smut  staying in shape  recreation and work
sex positivity seems to be just sleeping with multiple people and claiming to be liberated by doing so. it doesnt have any benefits on your mental and physical being nor is it good in any way long term and sets bad examples for how you should have relationships that are meaningful.
ally mcbeal was over-dramatic but it was also super liberal but it was well written   both serious   hillarious
well said
Ive never heard anybody try to make that incel argument before  but I think anybody who actually uses it has no idea why incels are the way they are or how to fix the problem. the hypersexualized culture is actually making it worse.
agreed to most of what was said however I would put the caviwt that prostitution should be made legal so as to protect those women. no matter what are views   religious or not  it is one of the oldest trades and it will always be there. promoting the idea of running it like a business means those girls will have insurance and protection. is it the best solution  perhaps not but it is way better than leaving those girls in the dark because anyone can become a prostitute and that is a culture shift we need to dismantle which is that only drunks and losers fall in that. that is often how they catch children into the trade.
a lot of western culture has an unhealthy fear of sex. especially the u.s  thanks to the puritanical religious foundations of the country. many people are simply told to fear their own sexuality  instead of being taught how to understand it. and that fear allows it to control them. because of that  they never learn how to have healthy relationships. their instincts scream for them to seek out the physical act  so they do. but they have no clue how to go beyond that  and actually form any sort of meaningful connection with anyone else. thus  we get so many one night stands  and high divorce rates. and its why so many people turn to pr0n  instead of seeking romance. its all they know how to do.teaching teenagers things like how to put on a condom is important  of course. but teaching kids how to form real meaningful relationships is far more important. we need to teach kids how to actually communicate  and connect to other people. they need to learn empathy  and how to develop emotional maturity. parents and teachers should be the ones to do this  but all too often we instead have to rely on our entertainment to fill in the gaps. which is why shows like she-hulk aren t helping anything.
the slope isn t slippery  its just down right greasy.
imagine if a male director had said this  these people are sick f   s and deserve to be canceled...
it is nice  however  seeing people who warned about these  slippery slopes  back in the 1960s  finally vindicated.
disney is 100  about grooming.
kids shouldn t be thinking positively about sex. they should just be allowed to be children without being forced by adults with their own damn agendas to think about sexuality and gender issues long before they are mature enough to understand and at an age when they should be allowed to be innocent and out playing with toys and watching cartoons.
the concept of the superfamily in comic books is gone  and its never coming back  the fantastic four are all that remains of that bygone era -- until they eventually erase that last vestige of faith  hope and wholesomeness  too. when superhero comic book writers and creators started making characters sexually promiscuous  that was the end of character development  in the context of relationships  marriage  and having a family  and everytime they do make that character development  they always rubberband thatshit back to the starting point with them  by either having them go through a breakup  divorce  or death. they are so anti-relationship  marriage and family  that they have to constantly torture these characters by having them going through the same  fucking cliche narratives  all because they  themselves  have no one in their own lives. they re not married  they dont have any children of their own  and they dont have a happy and fulfilling life with someone whom they want to spend the rest of their summers with  and die together on the same deathbed.
woe to those who say evil is good and good is evil.
it feels like actual problems and conservatives  problems  are being mixed in this converstion. this will make it hard to dicuss it unfortunately.
sometimes common sense isn t so common.
how about we try and rehabilitate the women who know fully well what they are doing and exploit mostly young men for money so that they dont have to work.
what is sex positivity  why is everything a movement and some sort of altruistic fight  what is it about sex that we need to fight for to make it positive  its literally everywhere we turn in society what more  positive  do you need
this is not what stan lee wanted marvel to be! its all gone south since his passing
I want to be in space watching the greatest shitshow called humanity. I wanna see if humanity will go extinct by its own doing by nuclear war or by other means. or will humanities future be like mad max  cyberpunk  or by some miracle we come together and have a future kinda like star trek.
excellent video.
your thumbnails are priceless. Im usually a live and let live type of guy but if you still have a disney account  youre part of the problem.
indescribably based.
Im a 35 year old single man and dating in today s world is crap because of this stuff! pushing it on kids is the worst possible thing that can be done. I hate everything thats going on its disgusting and it reminds me of sodom and gamora in the Bible.
conservatism  in its basic simplest form  isn t awful. being socially conservative  sex is a sacred act  abortion is murder in your eyes  take more responsibility for your actions  is fine when you dont force it upon everyone you ever cross paths with. you have the right to feel and do as you wish. progressivism in its purest form  higher wages for workers  equality of opportunity  freedom of expression  racial equity  etc.  is also good for our society. its when either ideology goes too far that I see how bad both can be.sex work  porn  prostitution  cam shows  etc.  is fine for those who participate in moderation and can function like normal people in everyday society. those who believe that watching porn or purchasing the services of a sex worker is a sign of  depravity   I dont agree with you  but I understand that perspective. introducing that to children  however  is not cool. however you feel as an adult about such things  introducing things like this to children will always be a problem.
100  correct. this is disgusting
its kinda funny how what s deemed the  progressive side  of society that fights for justice  freedom  and respect of others and our bodies as temples seems to somehow equate that to making sure nothing is seen as sacred of treated with respect anymore. including how respectable and valuable having self control as a trait is. honestly dehumanizes humans in a way. one of the few things thatseparates us from the animal kingdom and their weaker  single-minded state of acting on any impulses you have without accountability. we aren t enslaved to our impulses and repeating mistakes if we truly dont want to be. honestly a bit insulting to say your exercising freedom is just to openly be enslaved to your baseline desires.
Im sorry  but its just not in anyone s best interest to go too deep  and too soon into the topic of the birds and the bees. its something that has to be explained overtime little by little to make it understandable as a responsible choice that only grown adults can make for themselves. also  why is it okay for sex positivity to be displayed in the female characters  but if a male character even considers sex to be a good or fun time they re portrayed as evil pigs
its more scummy than the twerking incident
cant believe you actually came up with a bad reason to hate she-hulk. the Godawful overused cgI was right there.
correct me if im wrong but you dont actually think because someone watches porn they dont work out eat well or socialize right  because that is a pretty wild view lol
sex is not sacred  its a need and a necessity. its only sacred to people that believe in magic.
admittedly  the void youre yelling into is the gaping emptiness between the ears of these hollyweirdo people.Ive seen shows in the past that were kids shows but that had subtle asides for the adults watching as well  asides that kids wouldn t get in the slightest but that would make adults snicker.  no one in hollyweird these days has the slightest bit of actual creativity required to have subtle asides that kids wont get  so they just write so the slowest brains  like their own  know exactly what they re talking about and even kids get the message  which is crap.  I keep hoping hollyweird will fall into the ocean.  I kinda hate toI say that  but its true.
what would they do if they walked up on their kid talking to an adult about sex  would they accept it or be horrified  disney is rolling in his grave.
I think encouraging women to go around acting like sluts is not  female empowerment . feminism was meant to be equality and being treated with respect. now it got highjacked into being about deviant behavior and hating men. the early founders would be appalled on what the  modern feminism has become. and showing types of deviant and pervasive behavior geared towards young children should never be acceptable.  but knowing thats its disney  its no surprise since they have a history of abusing their child actors. if women in today s society want to look for a strong female character  then look at jill taylor from home improvement  mortica addams  velma  etc.
like my boy jesse lee peterson always says we are living in a fallen state..
there is no such thing as  sex positivity  for children. they are children  sex is not something they should be concerned with until the puberty stage of life.
to be fair the show didn t hav much nudity or even like a real sex scene. so depending on the age of your child and how sex aware or whatever you want your child to be  I wouldn t hav a big issue with them watching the show. in my opinion there are things being shown to kids that are definitely lot worse than the stuff in she hulk
puts a  little twist on she-hulk  smash   huh  xd
Christian  muslim  jew. one love. one God. many prophets.we either stand against the woke satanic death cult together  or we lose our children separately. dearborn
and some people still argue with me when I say  disney is evil   we re looking at the proof of that right here  right now.
all this political radical ideology stuff shoved into hbo max  disney plus  and netflix makes me want to say no thanks to all of it. I heard netflix will soon be coming out with a matilda musical. I have no interest in watching it for two reasons number one because the original matilda movie was perfectly fine  number two I just have this nagging suspicion that at some point the musical is going to shame and condemn parents who have the audacity to protest pornographic materials in kid libraries. I recently saw a commercial on youtube trying to make itsound like that if you are one of those people who has the audacity to say that certain books shouldn t be in kid libraries then you are a book burning nut job and that we should never censor books. I wish I saved the commercial because of how ridiculous itsounded
for now  I ll ignore your stance that liking sex is perverse  it isn t  and just focus on the message that you have taken completely out of context. the creators of the show were not intending to make porn for kids.nor did they.but  in your defense  whoever gave those quotes was an idiot and didn t explain what they meant  so much of the fault is theirs  not yours.what the person originally meant was this disney doesnt have  horny  shows  so the bar for being one of the  horniest  shows on disney  is very very low. any show where a person meets people on a social app then goes home and they go off camera to the bedroom is already  hornier  than 99  of shows on disney . she hulk does that  so it is one of the  horniest  shows on disney . however  we also wanted this show to be for kids so all the  horniness  is off camera or innuendo  thereby leaving adults to understand what s happening off-camera while innocent kids dont have their innocence spoiled by seeing  horny  things not meant for kids.therefore  she-hulk can be one of the  horniest  shows on disney  while also being for kids.that is what should have been said.that is what you should have understood.if you actually watched the show  which I think you did  you didn t see or hear anything inappropriate for kids. doesnt matter if the kid is 5 or 15  there isn t anything happening on camera that is inappropriate for them  except maybe the suicide stuff  which has nothing to do with  horny  .if youread these quotes youre talking about while keeping in mind the actual show you actually watched this should be fairly straightforward to process.unless  of course  youre so eager to own the libs and bash the show that you automatically and or deliberately interpret these quotes in the worst possible light even thought its obviously not what was meant.and oh my God  grooming  grooming there is no such thing!!!sure  there might be a couple hundred really sick pedophiles on earth who are now or have groomed kids. but the media is making it out like the entire population of california consists of 38 million  groomers   with another hundred million or so scattered all around the u.s. trafficking children in pizza shops or whatever.this is all stupid lies and its unbelievable to me thatsomebody like you  usually quite smart and perceptive in your reviews  actually falls for this stupid media b.s. it doesnt matter if youre democrat or republican  liberal or conservative  or centrist  do youreally think all liberals are  grooming  kids  really  a hundred million groomers in the u.s. what  they all have 1-2 kids in their basement  so maybe 150 000 000 kids being trafficked and groomed really just think for a moment and this is the most easily debunked lie in mainstream media today.
as a  child  I think sex positivity is good but this portrayal is most certainly not sex positivity its  perversion  positivity. I agree with like 95  of this video so yea
I was totally with you til you started preaching to how other adults should live. to each there own every one can live good life s there own way.
Im 60 nobody wants me to be sex positive
1 57 - youre right. this world is a sinking ship  which makes the job Christians have of winning people to Christ all the more important.
this show lives rent free in your head. also free advertising for disney!
I agree with mel great vid!we all know its right wing adults whoneed sex positivity!
your perspective on gina carona is abject wrong. comparing any political party to jews during the holocaust is just a lot of cringe to unpack. thats why I dont care that disney fired her  they dont want to offend their jewish audience by keeping her around. sorry  I generally like your videos but I remember you praising gina in another video and I had to call it out.I broadly agree with this video though. she-hulk isn t a sex ed class  its a comic for teens and older with adult sub-text  much like most marvel books of the 90s . if you wanna make the show sex-positive just slap the r-rating on there and be done with it. but dont pretend like sex in a so-called kids show is okay. this show is a dumpster fire
love the l sweatshirt btw!
in marvel s defense  she hulk was somewhat of a perverted character anyway. to be honest  her comics were honestly corny to me as a kid coming up in the 90s and especially 2000s. the tv show was actually just like the comics I remembered. it wasn t a bad show! I notice a lot of folks actually dont know a thing about she hulk  thats what she s about! corny and horny!
I know this probably sounds cliche  but you cant do  have  or be good without God  though you can pretend so . apart from God s strict restrictions on sex  1 man and 1 woman within the marriage bed   the envelope will always be pushed further and further away from that model...and younger and younger...the sacred act of sex should never be treated like a toy or game.
preach!
now Im one to say to educate children in certain things. case in point the lgbt as long as its appropriate. this is just wrong. this is something you should teach to teenagers. not five year olds
how far canthey go    srsly   !!! wtf is wrong with this company
you cant stop them from making shows like that but at least it is locked behind a paywall.  it is left up to the parents.  morality is not going to discourage promiscuous behavior.  teens by nature are rebellious.  but  the details  of std will.  remember the videos they showed you in high school in drivers ed   show them something like that on std.
I am truly terrified at how quickly kids are being sexualized in this country. its disgusting  and moving faster and faster everyday.
preach!!!
I haven t seen she hulk. but I hear alot of people who dont like it.
also fun fact   there are adults in gen z nowI d know im one
I wonder if a dude said or did what kat coiro  he d run outta town!
I really hope this is not true. but if this is.  that is disturbing.
sex and kids should never go into the same sentence. thats noncy behaviour
updated her wikI to show her child grooming side
I can say as a male who has been addicted to p rn for a long time  it has done a lot of damage and its not good  every time Ive always felt more sad and lonely  guys  stop watching this  go outside  work out  better yourselves  you aren t worthless and you are loved  dont buy into the lie  wake up today!
interesting aspect !how they handle the things of alcohol is not for young people too.
these directors sounds like all the vice presidents in  american psycho .
just when you think they cant get any lower...
thank you
Im calling it  the director is a predator....
groomers gonna groom
they are trying so hard to impress the wrong type of people or person that dont buy nor care about any of these things
whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy sigh anywho... keep preaching mel!!
and they wonder why people call them groomers...
it really is
thanks. I needed to hear that. as soon as I have the money  Im getting a gym membership and starting to work out again.
note to self mel wont give it up for french fries!
new movement  thinkofthekids
nine year old contacted her ! what bs!
Im bout ready for apophis to hurry up and get its big ass here..
sex anything and kids shouldn t even be in the same stratosphere. man society is fucked nowadays.
who are these people  we re infiltrated at every level.
20 years ago they would a called her a creep
I wish she would of give actual age of the whole child or kids things like talk about teenagers kinda kids like 15  or 16 actual kids like 8 or 9
basically do the exact opposite of what disney says.
more should call this out
there are too many levels to how bad this is in she-hulk to explain in one comment ..basically got me thinking about how in episode 8 a sex tape of her is revealed to the world and now the season is over and disney execs are posting how they wanted to promote  sex positivity  for kids to watch  how in the world does being unknowingly filmed while having sex become a  positive  thing after it is revealed to the world       what the heck was the original goal of filming she-hulk
sex show and kids in the same sentence!!! isn t this kind of stuff that makes people go to jail !
kids aren t allowed to just be kids.
this whole show was total projection from the hollywood writing staff from start to finish.
so y all are pissy about she-hulk being herself lol
let s be honest ...trolls wrote this show
90  of the men and women in the entertainment industry need to be on some predator watch list.
does drinking an energy drink and eating half a sandwich before work considered treating your body sacred  if not then woops lol love your channel. she hulk sucks
even if you take it at face value ... what positivity    whatever this show director is on I want some
let s be blunt. these are pea do s files we are dealing with
could barely watch half of this video. but its not your fault melonie....
this is why the mcu oh Im sorry the m-she-u is dying
they turning the kids gay  alex jones meme
the worlds gone mad
your not crazy... your 3rd eye is open... you have been blessed....
thank you for coming out against this  it is so disgusting
no more verse of the day  I kinda enjoyed those  what s the deal
hollywood grooming in the open.
sex positivity  and  children  should never be in the same phrase. what s wrong with people
the course of empire painting by thomas cole where everything is burning.  you are here
Im no marvel dc comic guy  really a  normie  who watches movies tv shows so Imay be totally out in left field but how many times were there sexually driven story lines for hulk    was he boning chicks in between matches on sicario
its called hiding in plain sight. dont be surprised. know your enemy s tactics.
wait  onlyfans models are getting naked for the greater good  I thought it was for money.
@melonie mac go boom --- you should check out  jason kohne  no white guilt .also  yizz the eunuch.
welcome to the brave new world.
what 9 year old is watching this show and leaving voice mails
if anybody has disney plus I hope its for netflix marvel and old films and tv shows before the woke apocalypse which occurred in 2020.
we wanted to make this realistic   really   the show were the main character jumped out of the show to attack the writers and directors  looney toons  style.     thats realistic
check snarky jay  great reviews of shy-hulk.
weinstein and epstein go down in a blaze of glory and hollywood just says you know what let s just normalize this sht.
melonie these people in hollywood are creeps and thoughts on the yakuza games
preach!
no where is safe anymore. we re at a breaking point  why do we have to be so chaotic.
I agree this is not okay
how to save my kids from the woke bs  hookup culture and gen z  Ive been pondering on this for a while. well first of  no cable tv. if they want to watch cartoons they ll only watch the classics  ben 10  tom and jerry  the og versions.next  no phones or laptops. we ll have a landline and a desktop computer and its peripherals in the living room. no social media  nothing like that  if you want to talk to people  talk to them in real life  to their faces.since they re not always on social media they ll have spare time. me and my wife will make use of this time to teach them skills  baking  football  programming  music  working for the church etc.most people say  men are never around to take care of the children because they work a lot  whilst true  I want to be there for them  I want to be an active participant in their life so my wife and I can be able to spot changes in our children s behavior and correct before it escalatesfinally  I wont be raising my kids in the us where sexuality is being pushed on children who do not know right from wrong.if every family can implement this  we will get rid of this gen z bs culture
its call grooming.
make the algorithm go boom.
can we put these people in jail yet   nothing marketed to children should be sex-positive  or sex-negative for that matter.  the cancer of pedophilia needs to be excised  in any way possible.
hail melonie go boom
they are of their father  the devil  and they are about their father s work.
they re making hook up culture  worse     it wasn t bad enough
but dont call it grooming
there were always films thatsexualized minors  like lolita. I thought that we passed that toxic mentality. sociaity needs to grow  not stagnate. yes thankfully this show does not involve children  but the fact that they want kids to watch this show will sent the wrong messege and I fear that it will have simmilar outcomes  because it is easy to groom adolocents on social media.
amen melonie
I like french fries
we homeschool to keep our kids away from this trash.  I remember when disney produced family-friendly shows.  those days are gone
grooming 101
this show isn t doing so well eh  dont think people like it much - probably due to the stuff you pointed out in part.
its not gonna be excised ... there s an effort to make this group into another letter to the lgbtq community right now  and unfortunately this group is well embedded and runs the platforms we use  the media we consume  and in our academic institutes systems.
the end times is near  unfortunately
disney  shuddap and lemme teach your kids about     _   x!  pst  n island ain t gonna build itself!!!
isn t every kid totally interested in shows about cringetastic women in their 30s swiping on tinder and drinking wine lol
if cuties movie has taught anyone anything they want kids to watch this. they teach it in schools colleges and tv movies. drag story time. its just gross. it definitely shouldn t be normalized.
this show is not going to be renewed.
more disturbing  she has three kids.
say no to dirty disney groomers. reject everything they do  protect all children s minds and values from filth.
yeah kids in china maybe
fantastic message throughout this video!!  the modern world is becoming sodom and gomorrah.
what generation is even doing this
why are teachers   doctor s and all these people losing morals  its because we allowed these low life s to write moves and shows like this
jennifer is easy and a lawyer. her number is in every jail bathroom in the country.
these are very twisted broken people.
melonie appreciates men   whoops melonie stays subscibed
Im a firm believer that kid children and sex should not be used in the same sentence.
these people are disgusting. protect children
she hulk is wide bro. you can park a truck inthere.
sex in the city 3.0
bro she is mad u cantell
children are not sexual they do not have a sex life. they are children! please protect them if you have them!
jen catfish one of her date in this show..
I 100  agree! this show is not for kids at all.  poor messages in it.
its jsut dawned on me... the only guy she-hulk gets in the series is a blind dude....
sex and disney dont go good together
they certainly didn t make a life of mindless  meaningless sex look very appealing.
your definitely not crazy
for the algorithm
tbh I thought you were the shehulk actress from the thumbnail.youre a lot more interesting than her.my bad I think it was the curly hair and small screen.
I am gen z  you hit the nail on the head  people wonder why  zoomers  are so disengaged and cynical  its because the older generations  pardon my french  fucked everything and just left us the violated remains  thanks millennials. dating sucks major balls  its a real struggle.
there is no way anyone can excuse this its disgusting.baffled how they get away with it.effin groomers
her make up looks different
sex positive  for kids. sounds like a predatory show to me.
good God  when did being woke in hollywood become synonymous with words like arrogant  entitled  and intolerant
its extremely hard for anyone to contact directors directly   especially ones who work for marvel and disney... but 9 year olds are all over her voice mail asking for more  yeeeaaaahhhh ok....
years ago I tell a friend disney is the worst company in the world he laugh well I am right
she hulk is sexist in the comics but it doesnt show pure nudity. its like stripperella without the sex part.
I for one will be boycotting disney for the way that they treated their fans with this show. no more marvel for me. also hook up culture is disgusting  people need purpose  real love and to improve their mental health rather than giving to the woke culture.
could you change the end song
shehulk lost all their views they trying to get fresh meat
whaaaat  the hollywood pedal file culture is being more blatant and trying to normalize their fetishes  who would have guessed.
theyre so sin obsessed they cant see it
so its for trolls  woman  kids.
thats it  my kids will be watching anime when they are 3  non of this kids show horror.  sad to see what s going on with the marvel universe
snu snu!
she is just digging herself in a bigger hole. its kind of pathetic and sad.
how do you separate the girls from this kind of woman   with a crowbar.
what s wrong with smut
nice l sweater
I dont think she hulk is a comic for children to be honest.. its for 15-16 plus  at least  I think itshould be 18  tho
melanie  13 days til  halloween
@melonie mac boom if I buy you french fries  like in the she hulk show  would you marry me   .
yeah  this was sex negative. I dont want it  wouldn t even hit and quit. she has less than zero respect for herself  Ive no respect for her.
glad that I unsubscribed from disney  after hearing about this so they re not getting another dime from me  I never watched she hulk and I dont plan to
boom!
oh give me a break! hey miss marvel director please expound upon all these nine year olds that have your number and call you with their deep undertanding of the adult themes on tv!!I could get so rich on all these things that never happen for  1000!let it all burn. please bring the sky down already we re done!
modern western writers really think that promoting sex  a topic that is clearly 100  aimed at teens or adults  towards kids is somehow considered a good thing. remember  people on twitter always bitch   moan about how japan sexualises female characters   call it pedophilia  yet when the westesrn hollywood does it  then its considered brave   progressive on their part. just kind of shows how low the human race has gotten in the last couple of years  because promoting topics that clearly aren t aimed at kids being aimed at kids just kind of shows that people who do this aren t right in their heads   should be thrown into the mental asylum.
I love her in the comic but in this tv show I dont think I want to see that. I dont want to aggravate my brain tumor I  get from watching all of modern hollywood garbage.
been saying it for years  theres a reason theres a   at the end of lgbt  eventually they want to add the p there. its obvious for anyone with a functioning brain and eyes.
good call
not for french fries  but a medium rare steak with butter on top would work
@melonie mac go boom  didn t realize it would be this easy to find my significant other . to think I wasted so much time going on dates . love the content btw!
@jordywillsayit  you a wild boyy
@melonie mac go boom  I think thats a fair compromise
jay-zus  remember when disney just produced a terrible superhero television show  everyone at marvel should just not use social media when they talk about marvel...it never turns out well...
this whole she-hulk bullshit is them saving face because nobody is going to admit the show is terribly written in every turn.the hook-ups in show weren t shown to glimmer at all  because story context  demands  youread it as  men are trash   and after all that  still drops the ball.
these people are not real!!!! what is this shit... it blows my mind how backwards everything is and the bar is constantly being raised with psychotic behavior
even if its not deliberate  its still inappropriate and creepy as fuck.
I love a based girl  thanks for calling out this vile degeneracy
well prostitution is not a crime here in brazil but if it was and the police dind t look the other way I guarantee  thins would get ugly fast.
I didn t watch the show but someone said she hooked up with five different men over 9 episodes. how is that  positive  for women  its truly disgusting.
the wood chipper is unisex     brrrrrrrrrrrr
these people are sick
you know what how about     negativity
hahahahahahaha... she s a director! hahahahahahahahaha !maybe she could just direct people to their seats. badum-tshhh  sorry  but it needed to happen
these people need Jesus.
one step from people actually wanting irl purge to appease the murderers....ugh so disgusting.
why is youtube in italic font
you d make a better point on some of this is you dropped the zealous outcry of  perversion  or the concept  of sin constantly under-toning this whole video.    que all the  nice guys  about to come for my throat in the name of our great lady wafiu
showing disrespect for disrespect isn t a verb  and if you point websters at me  I ll show you some of their more recent redefinitions.
melonie mac go boom boom
did anyone notice that the only two kinds of guys in this show-stupid or overly  and comedically  misogynist types thatshe degrades and the ones she finds  bangable     in our old pal frosk s words but thats ok. jen is a wamman    who degrade her  and this is for kids
red flag!!! 0_0
I agree that they shouldn t be normalizing sex  for  children  thats a bad precedent to be instilling in youths. I however disagree that it is all bad as a good majority of adults that grew up with it not being normalized for them now are sexless as adults which will in the future hurt populations and work force numbers  happened before and is still happening in japan and its the reason their media is so sexualized  they are trying to get their early adulthood generation making more people. I dont whole heartedly agree with the way they are trying do it  but stuff has to be done as well  think it would be better to teach safer and more wholesome forms of sex through marriage and love and the like. just my 2 cents. thanks for the video melonie.
its disgusting  isn t it
mental health. wild american doesnt speak about this but I get why they dont. cant trust the government.
groom much
I friggen love u mel no @
they really took nothing from original shehulk
why though
nothing says female empowerment like self-objectification
what was the takeaway from she hulk s sex-positive direction  didn t seem positive. seemed really shallow
its small hats
this is the kind of perverted behaviour that is expected from malignant narcissists who created this show. keep all sexual messaging away from kids.
so many women coming out to say they pass 35 without having kids and live with regrets because they ve been hoes or because men now are just looking for hookup. its pretty sad to see for both sex. be better humans
I see marvel losing a lot in the next few years because of these terrible shows and movies
what 9 year olds are sending this chick emails  clearly she doesnt have any of her own. if I had kids I would keep them far away from anything marvel or disney.
they are sick in the head
we live in a clown world except its not funny.
reminds me of tron  a disgusting  user.
maybe keep  sex  away from children  period.
she - hulk was written by kindergartners. this show is not for kids based on content. not family friendly at all. writers are groomers. 21st century writers forgot what comics are  they are about heroes  not adult themes.
I hate how they keep putting sexuality crap in children s shows  scooby-doo isn t about who finds who attractive  its about solving mysteries... marvel is supposed to be about superheros fighting evil villains... sure  hinting at it  making some stuff that ll pass over children s heads but the adults will get  is fine  but targeting children with sexuality is not cool.
ahh... Im so looking forward to the inevitable collapse of society.
while I dont disagree with the disgust of the message being put out for sex positivity for children  people need to in general stop blaming millennials. they were the last generation to have actual childhoods. gen z on the other are a million times more  open  about themselves. millennials didn t influence anyone. if we look at the amount of gen z who were like 12 and wearing  acting like 18 year olds insane. I think the narrative of blaming millennials is old  most of them are in their 30s now with families trying to raise them the most civil way possible. if you look at the amount of supporters this show has its younger people not anyone with a fully developed cerebral cortex.
superficiality is the new positivity.
the thing is  a lot of people assume it is the expectation for the dating culture and either participate or drop out. finding someone else away from the  dating scene  takes social networks that people often dont have due to being away from family or having a very isolating school or work environment or just being introverted.there really isn t a lot of help for people trying to find alternatives to hookup culture.
@lawofimprobability  you are right on the money. from all my friends and family  nobody got a gf bf from a dating app that became someone relevant in their life. even my wife Ive met at the Christmas party for the company I work for. real connection happens in a real social environment  something like point out that is dwindling rapidly in opportunity. its very sad.
incels  dont hurt women  rapists and abusers hurt women.  there s nothing wrong with not having sex  involuntary or voluntary.
who would let a kid watch this
hookups are not just healthy for women. it is bad for men as well. detaching the emotions from sex is not a good thing. the list of reasons are to many and too complex to go into here. women have never been more liberated  than now. but why are some of them choosing to imitate the worst part of the male actions
anyone who would use horniest in a sentence is a creep.
loose hookup culture is not sex positivity. and kids dont need to be hearing about sex. period. wtf is going on lately
positivity as in not vulgar to display for kids  how is that not grooming
well guess Im not watching anymore stuff directed by this person
everything I learn about this show makes it worse. please make itstop.
these people are degenerates
stay away from kids ffs. its an easy concept to understand.
you cantell there are a bunch of harvey weinstein wannabees at disney.
spin off -she hulk destroys misogyny by going topless at work....  bet that would sell and rating would go up.
where were u my whole life
reverse the genders and this show and the lead actor is cancelled.
the incredible ho
the sex scenes on she hulk are pg  yes...but are litterally teenager and adult material.its like when tony stark had a wild scene in ironman in 2008..reason I never called superhero movies  for kids .plus jen is not a so admirable person  and this is on any age...litterally not having any moral statement on relationships.so no  mrs coiro...living only on hook-ups is not possitive  specially talking to children.I advocate for sexual freedom...but having like 20 lovers in a week is a problem.
as a gen z er I can say we re absolutely sick of this crap. we. do. not. want. this.
dont worry no1 watched it
why are u crying melonie   ur eyelashes have some kinda organised paint on them ..
I dont see how this is positive. none of jenny s relationship were healthy... plus she s a very toxic person... also... keep the children out of s x positivity talks... it makes you look like a creeper. happy to see more people talking about this!
indeed
thank! you!
these people are sadomasochists. they derive pleasure from their own suffering and the suffering of others.
I really dont want to sound rude but do you have something in your mouth  like this is a genuine question  Im just noticing itseems like there s something in your mouth and Im not sure if youre doing it for auditory quality  reasons or not
she hulk as a character deserved so much better than this awful trash show.
normalize demisexuality
I dont think people believing in this even has children...
bing a petty woman child who hates men was a thing but this is from 1 to 1000  she needs to be stopped
what is wrong with these types of women
sus among us
is thatshrek hulk or cringe hulk the more they push them erative the more people push back and not watch that crap.
these weirdos keep trying to make sexuality an open discussion with kids then get mad when you call them groomers.
fwiw  the greeks and romans used to be perfectly fine with grown men having young boys as more than just...  assistants   so to speak.  and as far as I know  nothing bad ever happened to either of those empires...............wait
ew  why are they like this
stop. hiring. activists.
kids need church  not garbage like that.
disney  0 talent 100  sicko
never did any child under 15 ask to know what happened next. thats like saying man babies should be allowed in woman facilities. grooming in 6i6n6ey started with walter disney. 332.
Im cringing.
ok  here s the fact  teaching sexuality to children is not evil if done correctly!in scandinavia schools teach sex-ed to children as old as 4yo  I repeat  sex-ed  meaning teaching how reproductive system works  what are the differences between genders  what does a relationship entices... the consequences the scandinavian peninsula has the lowest ratio of unwanted pregnancies  stds  sex crimes and the latest age of loss of virginity.with that being said... teaching sex-ed is different from teaching horniness and misandry!also  she-hulk comics are far from being sexual centered as this crapshow  even if you think of marvel comics as not for children.the only time marvel tried to enforce a story about jen having one-night stands... they retconned-it!all the debacle  did she sleep with the juggernaut   turned out to be a dimension-travelling tourist wearing a  disguise  as she-hulk just so she can go around and party like crazy and  yes  even hook-up with whoever she wanted.again  another proof that the creators of this show know nothing about what they are writing about and would be better off scrubbing burned grease off of a macdonald s oven.or in jail  seeing what they would like to show to children...
y all got issues....
tatiana maslany  kat coiro  megan thee stallion  jameela jamil  victoria alonso   jessica gao are the worst of the worst of the worst of the worst of the worst of the worst of the worst
its not about the women  if you like it good for you but dont say that kids should watch it.
exactly!
they made jennifer walters into a clown with female neurotic anxiety instead of a confident and competent lawyer. it turns feminism into a clown show and they actually defend this as a normality for women in their 30 s. very poorly written.
this is so disgusting
disgusting and deplorable...
double standards as usual. if a man produced this show he would get absolutely destroyed for saying this. but  its positive  because its a woman. groomers.
this show is not comic accurate lol. tell me you havent read the comics without telling me you havent.
ang lee s hulk is better.
call cps
hollyweird just needs to go down  and they re making it easy putting out garbage like this.
lol thinking going to the gym and a better diet will help men with women is pretty delusional
purr
it isn t comic accurate.
you cant make this shiet up.  how is showing random hookups positive for children
gross
not even school is safe from grooming  are you nuts  do you think that the church and the gop are good for kids or something  teachers are the main people in this society who care about kids.
your right  this show is just trash kids should not be really watching it
this any many other reasons is why the mcu is dead or dying. the mcu will never return to it former glory. rip mcu

sorry not sorry  but anyone who wants to make something  sex positive  and then aim it towards kids just sounds like a pervert to me... if youre making something for kids  then itshould be for kids! or better yet  why not do what countless shows have done in the past and make the show for both adults and kids without it being awkward like this. how many shows did we grow up with that had jokes that we never got until now  those were for the adults  but the kids didn t understand so it went under the radar. what was so wrong with that
its hard to believe you and thatstar wars girl are friends. you perspectives in objectification are totally opposites sides of the coin.
disgustinf
gross. why  just why  I dont get it.
go cancel culture . youre offended over something that is life and perfectly normal world wide  try protecting them from the over sexualized music and music videos inundating their day to day. youreally know how to ruin things for people. live your life and leave people to do with theirs as they please. here is a little advice. opinions are like assholes  everyone has one and no one is interested in seeing or hearing yours.
I cant let me kids watch she hulk --- it was constantly inappropriate and the language -- plus not funny esp to kids
turn back to God. Jesus in heaven. not the pope
the show is garbage but as I expected most people making youtube videos critizing the show are the  shes a slut  guys and thats not why the show is crapis not bad treating youre body as youre temple but acting like if you dont youre disrespecting yourself and other is a really boomer stupid way of thinkingalso I dont think this show was aimed at  children  it doesnt have children shitonly superheroes but superheroes are more for teens this video was kinda cringe
with all due respect I dont understand how you can be against she hulk sex positivity while at the same time advocate for lara croft s sex positivity
c mon melonie mac  we all know the real reason she hulk is hated is because a bunch of incels like you and shad brooks wanted to hate on it. there s no way the show could have legitimate criticisms against it. this is your way of continuing to rail against it because it irritated you that much
lara croft doesnt have sex or do anything sexual in the tomb raider games  these are not the same thing. wanting lara croft to be beautiful and have her classic curvy figure isn t about sex
@melonie mac go boom  melonie what youre referencing is straight up sex  however  sex positivity  covers every aspect of sexual identity including gender expression  orientation  relationship to the body  body-positivity  nudity  choice . I would definitely feel lara s expression and how shes protrayed within the games  and advertising  covers these grounds. she s also been no stranger to sexual innuendos. shes always been an iconic figure for women who want to break the stereotype that beautiful women with curvy figures arent only damsels in distress but can be powerful too. she is sex positivity defined.
@angel summers  your definition is very all encompassing.   while melonie mac go boom  is just saying dont advertise sex to kids... I think you d agree with that yeah
@melonie mac go boom  sex positivity according to bing..  an open  tolerant  or progressive attitude toward sex and sexuality  I think you got the w over angel summers on this one.
@napoleon dynamite  thats not what the director was talking about either and you know that. if you cant have an honest discussion then dont even bother
@angel summers  well thanks for telling me what the director s thoughts where and that my interpretation is absolutely wrong. can I pay you for lessons on legilimency so I can read directors minds as well
@angel summers  even if youre right about what the director meant.. the words sex and kids should never be used in the same sentence  paragraph or interview unless its to say  dont use those words together or anywhere near eachother  could we agree on that or do you think kids should be worried about the most adult shit like the topic sex
