Imade it on melonie mac!!!!!!
as... unsettling as this is  let s all give thanks that this topic graced us all with melonie s greatest thumbnail to date
Im so happy to be a child of the 80 s. superheroes were cool  villains badass and rolemodels manly. on the other hand it is so exhausting to see everything good from my childhood being destroyed.
I dont think its that complicated. we ve degraded as a society so much thatsome artist felt comfortable enough to publish their fetish.
I guess joker s evil plan this time is to lie that batman s the father in order to get thatsweet child support cash.
melonie  I will say I appreciated and miss your Bible verses. it was a breath of fresh air seeing a content creator not afraid to preach their faith  even if it was respectfully held till the end so others could choose to stay or not.
thought I was pregnant once  it was just a double cheeseburger.
melonie s face in the thumbnail is all I need to know about this video.
I decided to take a break from comics in early 2020. since then  every time I consider getting back into them  something like this happens and I say to myself   yeah ... I can wait.
joker  wanna know how I got these scars  points at c-section scar on stomacheveryone  uh... no. I think we know how...
Im a man. at my last annual checkup  they said   hey  this might sound weird  but we have to ask it. have you ever been pregnant   the world is getting weird fellas
where s the fetus going to gestate  you gonna keep it in a box!  -monty python.
you either die a hero  or you live long enough to see yourself become the mother of a mud baby.   joker  maybe
from now on there is an actual comic where joker shits a baby out. this is genuinely sad to see.
I like the fact that zatanna doesnt lobotomize the joker like how she did with dr light back in identity crisis and instead sterilized him and failed horribly  she s more concerned about his potential offspring than the present clown prince of crime himself  now thats storytelling
mud  baby  they sure didn t think that one through
is there any reason why ivy has put on sixty pounds  naruto had another character turn into an overweight person. but she was constantly snacking of junk food  so when she stopped being a field shinobI and took a desk job  her eating habits caught up with her. is there anything like that with ivy  or is it just thatshe is now
yay! new video from melonie. always makes my day and Ive been waiting for this one since she mentioned it last night!
you bring such a positive energy. fun to watch your breakdowns.
imagine an animated movie with hamill screaming in birth pains!
so happy you made that tweet and I happened on it. stoked to see more of your videos too!
not making it into melonie mac is the only thing I regret about not having twitter ngl
and may the good Lord save you from the brain damage of seeing and reporting on this.  I honestly thought this was going to be some sort of weird jared leto story.  Im not sure if this is better or worse than I expected.
lol cheers
sounds lewd
@budgie cat    melonie happened on it too... hmmm.so slimy
I bust up laughing as soon as I saw it lmao
aaand now an emojI in the nerdrotic discord
thatsounds kind of boring to be honest and a very boomer take
@static charm  you dont even know what boomer means.
I feel your pain.
I want your childhood.
if youre a child of the 80s then you know there was tons of tv shows back then that featured pregnant males
@gloria thomas  no actual comic or piece of media worth taking seriously was. youre either blind by your woke narratives or unable to determine what is canon and what is made for nothing more than humor. probably both.
@static charm  we can only envy boomer generation to be honest
the reason zatanna rejected clownboI is because he s obviously a cheater. zatanna... you are not the father! the baby is brown. and also made of mud.
you see a artist involved with. .whatever this thing is
thats all anything is these days  fetish projection. no movie  video game  comic  political conversation or random inanimate object is safe from it.
wtf!  itsounds like he has to poop!
occom s razor.
who owns the media
@patrick henry  stan lee and jack kirby  creators of your precious comics  are jewish if youre trying to go down the hurr durr jews own the media route.
I think the joker mistook pregnancy with the simple gesture of taking a dump.
@dragon ball fans cant read  and your argument was
joker already stole all of bruce wayne s money.
wouldn t be out of character for the joker.
@hoi4odude thats too much creative thought. you need to dumb that down a little more.
his most diabolical plan yet...
and thats how batman and joker became a scandalous divorced coupleIm just happy to live in these times  so much crazy sh t is happening at once
@kristina williams  not if he makes a joke out of it. and let s be real  he would.

a devious  yet socially acceptable scheme!
shake down bruce wayne for cash seems like a good plan
this is exactly something joker would do
@gloria thomas  name one
@spyderdan1985  name one what  ever watched alien nation  sliders  star trek enterprise
@gloria thomas  none of those are 80s shows and I dont recall a pregnant man in any of those. it also doesnt change the reality that men cant get pregnant.
@static charm  I find it funny how so many young people think boomers grew up in the 80 s.
@spyderdan1985  alien nation did have a male character that was preggo.  it was part of their mating process.  also  he was one of the main characters.  sliders is the only show not started in the 80 s. also  tv shows are not real life.  not even reality tv.
@john kirkpatrick  star trek enterprise is from 2001. but you are right about them all being fictional.
@spyderdan1985  my bad I read tng.  I find it funny how bent out of shape people get over fictional characters.   this  I dont like it  it needs to go   from both sides of the isle is hilarious.   if you dont like it.....dont watch read it.  simple math.  cancel culture is in overdrive on both sides.
villains were role models
@todd taylor and neither does people know what gen z means
@stealthkillz311 canon  comics and canon barely mix
@worlddd777 Imean they were catered to by their parents and had a lot of benefits later generations did not.and maybe its not true but whenever someone brings this up the older gens just get mad and start saying the generation is the problem not the economy or social issues
@chandler burse  oh  right. I almost forgot. we got to learn how to read. that turned out to be really useful later in life.
@starscream  social security was better if I am not wrong.buying a house at a younger age was more possible.from what I know in history some benefits did exist back then.also your not a boomer if you were a child of the 80s I feel
@starscream  also odd that the same people who get angry when you point out thatstuff was more beneficial in their time are the same ones who also brag about the 80s the economy and reagan era economics.so which fucking is it I dont even pay anything I dont know what my future holds or how rough it is yet. but life feels like a damn bore I want to move on but at the end of the day a lot of problems persist and despite motivation to keep going I continue to wonder is it worth it and hell part of me just thinks if death is the end then this life being it kind of makes it worse.
@chandler burse  you just admitted to liking non canonical logical bullshit like this. good to know. canon in comics does mix. ie dc rebirth. but  thanks for confirming you like headcanon shit and not actual content.
@chandler burse  Imean doom is pretty badass.  js
@john kirkpatrick  badass isnt the same as role model
@stealthkillz311  dc has changed canon so many times tho so that was my point they are confusing. batman year one use to be canon so did long halloween and knightfall.
@stealthkillz311  what headcanon crap  when did I say I ever liked any of it  stop putting words in my comments  where did I say that I just said canon barely mixes because they freaking change whats canon so much so how is there even a proper canon anymore
@stealthkillz311  yes rebirth exactly my point retconned new 52 itseems which itself retconned many previous dc stories including year one and crap.
@chandler burse  no fictional character should be a role model.  not even the good ones. .... but doom defeated mad celestials.... so.....
@john kirkpatrick  fictional characters are used as role models all the time.superman is a big one.
Im so over these clowns already
he will poo out jr
there s a reason so many are nostalgic for a time they ve never experienced
@spyderdan1985  pregnant men has been a thing since ages even egyptian mythology and remember that arnold movie
@ali  so they re fictional and not real is what youre saying
@greg c.  its like the 80s are some kind of holy decade yet people do actually argue who were from that period that it wasnt as great as everyone imagines.the movies were good I suppose at least some but generic action flicks were too common then too.I prefer the late 90s to 2000s nostalgia
@spyderdan1985  yeah so dont let it hurt you so much I guess lol.although why joker I dont know it makes little sense to use him. and if this is suppose to be some positive representation why they pick an insane omnicidal clown then again people also believe joker is a sigma male because sigma or alpha males   men who are psychos who butcher children and people.
how could you have hroen up in the greatest decade for comedy and yet be so thoroughly lacking in a sense of humour  thats crazy.
@patrick henry  ted turner and the murdochs.
@dragon ball fans cant read  oh noes!  some rando on youtube called me a mean name for the bazillionth time! whatever shall I do ! I get it  noticing patterns is antisemitic!  its all just a coincidence.  if they re black  then its a gang. if they re italian  its a mob. but if they re jewish  its a coincidence and you should never speak about it. -dave chappelle
@dragon ball fans cant read  ok  bud.
thatseems like something that could happen in the harley quinn show
I second that.
third
I couldve sworn she said she was gonna stop telling verses tho
@chandler burse  yes indeed  though thats no reason we have to stop missing it
4th
@jake jimenez  4th
@david low  I never hear them tho I never actually watch her vids fully
those food babies can kick too if taco bell is the daddy.
@shawn mccown  especially with the diablo sauce
I birthed a  mud monster  once.  after too much taco bell .
@grayfoxiii7953hey you joke  but for us guys getting full or eating something that doesnt agree with us can feel like that. xd
@demonicremption  oh there is no joke here  I speak from experience myself
@edward bernard  Im birthing a  mud monster  right now while watching to this video! does that make me a joker just joking!
@shawn mccown  for real  sir
@edward bernard   mud monster!
@shawn mccown   I remember my friend turkey  thats his nickname  was borrowing my 2nd motorcycle as we were riding around town at night and he suddenly had the craving for taco bell. I was tired and just wanted to go home and I was not hungry at all and I warned him about the taco bell mud babies which usually are birthed in mere minutes after eating  but he pushed for itso I gave in and said okay and he got some through the drive through and of course on the way home he had to go to the bathroom so he used my bathroom of course and my God I dont know wtf he did in there but itsmelled for a week  I think he took a shower and exploded the taco bell baby in the shower  or he exploded on the toilet and made such a mess he had to use the shower one of the two. I dunno. but  it was horrible and I ll never forgive him for that what a turkey
@budgie cat
agreed
nod
why you go rippaverse or anime manga
rippaverse says hi
@jonathan stevey what the hell is rippaverse
@chandler burse  eric july s book...isom
@jonathan stevey  k
same.  Ive just stayed away from dc and marvel and have had a better experience away from either camp.
rofl!!!!!!
reminds me of the boss in mgs3 for some reason.
if this is true  its not even funny. just sad and degenerate.
please  please tell me you are joking!!!
I hope you can find a new doctor. cant trust someone thatstupid with my health. I would have so many aggressive questions for them  they d probably make me leave lol
@d  I think my doctor is smart lol. I think its just a stupid policy they have to follow - based on how they asked it. but its strange considering they know Im not trans.   but I get where youre coming from lol.
@tom coop  yeah  doc. Ive got one in the oven right now. concieved at taco bell.stomach gurgling.uhhh... doc  where s your  delivery room  .
@volyren  lmao
to which my response might be   did youreally graduate from medical school
life of brian reference .
peoples front of judea
@allennium falcon   are you the judean people s front
next time you should request that  doctors  credentials. seriously. do it. for the good of humanity.
you should have said yes just for the giggles
@tom coop your doctor is smart if he recommended vaccines.so I hope he did.
@happy everyone here telling him he should distrust his doctor of which he clearly has already assured he doesnt distrust him.he probably had to ask this because of recent policy like chill out people.
@volyren
@thezondassounds like they ripped off ren n  stimpy adult party cartoon.
he gets periods but actually they re hemorrhoids.
its absolutely disgusting.
@happy  facts just disgusting
and I d rather joker go back to being a maniacal sadist if this was evil joker he have tracked zatanna down and literally shoved this mud puppy down her throat to silence her from casting and then batman would probably have to save her since she cant save herself if she s silenced
@jackratscratpack  zatanna can still use magic without speaking. she just does it to help concentration but she doesnt need it
@gage unruh  if this was regular joker she still wouldn t get a chance most likely he would have tortured her then spritzed her with laughing gas
@jackratscratpack  you do understand she has faced off with the joker before right  where him and dr light did gag her...only for her to whoop both their asses right after without help right  joker is an ant to zatanna
@jackratscratpack  also torture doesnt work on zatanna  she has a mental spell thatshuts off pain for her and causes any injury that would be inflicted on her to her attacker aswell as spells that cancel toxins.       she has used the first spell fighting lobo and the other against other poison users who tried toxins to make her tired or kill her slow
@gage unruh  what source
@gage unruh  what comic is it from and what year was it
@gage unruh  again give me the sources I want to know if these stories were written before comics went to shit and if its written by someone thats not a mediocre or just bad writer
@jackratscratpack  but I guess if youreally want the info on the joker comic then it was zatana issue  1 in 2010 crisis on infinite earth s.
@jackratscratpack  lmao the year doesnt mean shit  its still the offical character and shit they do  and joker always loses to zatana
@jackratscratpack why would joker beat a magic wielder  at least easily with just physical skill  shes a hero he isnt. almost every hero has beaten joker a few times despite the times he has also taken advantage of them
@chandler burse  magic isn t all powerful there s weaknesses and if there s weakness anyone can exploit it
lmao
there s a prescription for that
now that I think about it....what does ivy eat  does she get panic attacks when someone serves her a salad    does she eat meat only  if so maybe thats how she put on the pounds
poison ivy  in a nutshell  is the personification of plant-life. stands to reason she d be overweight  because plants are so fat.
shudder bleh lol
@spyderdan1985   look  the head is crowning  and it looks like captain clown!!!
@hot rod  hahahahahaha
honestly  we re living in a reality where even the joker  if he was real  would become a conservative and help batman fight against the woke losers. not because he s a good guy but because nothing he would do criminally would stand out any longer and in some cases he d even be constantly outshined by the woke especially with all the trans community is doing. the joker would start cleaning up society of these woke losers permanently.
maybe its just a joke...  this is canon  you guys...  God d a m n it-
jim lee has went in a strange direction with dc. he was one of the best x-men artists and his wildstorm label was great. he really did some great stuff when he came to dc and now he s gone off the rails.if dc and marvel disney dont stop with the hold my beer competition they are going to run it all into the ground.
when I first heard the joker birthed a mud monster  I just thought it was fun way of saying joker had taken a dump. my mistake! how are those comics sales  dc
the joker  when he no longer has batman to keep him company so found solace in beer and takeout.
I am not a constant viewer on your live commentary channel but I love your personality and wanted to say congrats on 100k!!! Ive seen this channel grow since its birth!
I d like to compare and contrast really quick  rumiko takashashI was once asked   if ranma-chan  the girl form  got pregnant  and switched back to male  would he still be pregnant   to which rumiko responded   there are several things I just dont think about for my characters. and neither should you.
I really hope they keep this up. I hope as  many people as possible see this  and understand exactly who these mentally deficient ideologues are and what they believe
melonie   I dont know how much longer I can do this. sigh. me too  sister. me too.
Im just going to enjoy what dc used to be  not the trash thats out now
I bet that the writer doesnt even see its ironic that the joker is pregnant. just when you thought dc couldn t be a bigger joke they go and do this
sooo many jokes you could make about this. if an incarnation of the joker went through something traumatic  he could at least say  well its better then being pregnant.
we are truly living in the golden era of comics
miss mac wins the best thumbnail of the week award.
who else burst out laughing at that thumbnail  well played.
congratulations on 100k subs. Imust admit to giving birth to kinda mud babies on a daily basis. haven t raised one as my child though.  stay safe and keep drinking.
melonies pronunciation issues will never get old.  bet evs hasn t heard that one before  lol. never change melonie  youre just too cute.
your face on the thumbnail is fantastic. good to see that youre feeling better I always enjoy the videos. this is why dc is failing and will continue to bleed money and fans.
sometimes you gotta let the writers get this sort of thing off their chest. it helps the company know who s up next when its time for layoffs.
man is pregnant  man is impregnated by a woman  making a baby was a curse  children are vomit interesting family values they re pushing
now thats a comic that I will buy...
id buy that for a dollar
joker is apolitical. his politics is chaos
yes make a comic that panders towards heavy politics in order to fight against comics that pander to heavy politics.stinks of hypocrisy.and dont give the stupid  fight fire with fire  answer doesnt work without any real backup.
@chandlerburse2754  not really. the joker s politics may be chaos to a simpleton. however  the joker has a massive ego. an ego that doesnt like being outshined. his chaos can only be chaos in a mostly conservative society with good morals and good human decency. if you put joker in a society that is mostly already chaotic  everyone is a degenerate  nothing is sacred  nothing has any meaning  nothing has value  no morals  no decency  no laws  everyone is corrupt to the core from a local peon right up to the president of the country and open about it too  etc etc... the joker doesnt stand out at all anymore. he s literally just another citizen. his ego would not like that at all. he would not enjoy that world at all. all the fun he gets from his form of chaos would be stripped away. he d be insulted if people started associating him with the woke losers based on his hair being green too. he d get enraged  quickly start dealing with the problem  and he has no 1 rule to hold him back like batman has.
@k1n63d  what  what is this  joker is still a man of chaos and unpredictability and a love for batman or obsession more like.thats the essentials of his character
@k1n63d  joker would probably kill random leftists if someone mocked him. but thats not saying much he will get enraged if you mock him at all and may end up massacring a few people.and sometimes he ll do the opposite in no mans land he was gonna kill a truckload of infants but sarah the current wife of gordon intervened and confronted him. this disappointed him for some reason and he just caught her off guard with a baby being thrown  killed her then left unsatisfied didnt even kill the babies.he s of chaotic unpredictable actions. thats joker
@k1n63d  joker wouldnt enjoy any world thatstrips him of any sort of fun or power.he needs gratification but joker isnt a conservative and if you think him genociding liberals is conservative then I have to question your own sanity and morals lol.
not to me
its not canon. every issue ends with a wacky one off story meant to harken back to the silver age. they re not canon and just for fun. all y all are just being way too serious.
@k1n63d  thats not a simplisitic understanding he isnt conservative I know that he isnt politics he isnt anything that is trivial human norm behavior.
@k1n63d  you say joker has an ego thats true but if your trying to say he is conservative because he would be annoyed at a liberal society thats not an understanding of the character thats just your own bias slipping in.and then you dont even explain you just want to berate me for not agreeing with your odd conclusion.so either I am not wrong and neither are you necessarily or your saying he s a conservative because he does what he does and gets mad at annoying people and kills them. something many batman villains will do.besides maybe the genocide unless its harvey of course and for some reason he flips a coin for it and it lands that way.
@k1n63d  joker 2019 is a simple understanding that joker is some anti-hero for the poverty ridden mental ill folk when thats not his character at all.joker to me I understand from the comics and animated series. a chaotic arguably super sane individual who breaks the fourth wall may be aware of that he s fictional.an egomaniac sure although to not the extent of riddler I would debate.someone who wants control but enjoys games and unpredictable actions from his foes occasionally like batman.a person who doesnt even know his backstory gets confused about it and quite frankly doesnt care.a contrast to batman as well.joker is chaotic I have no idea what youre saying beyond  he s conservative  which is dumb because where the hell are the comics where joker votes for reagan or says he supports the 2nd amendment  hell he likes illegal guns more probably or he goes out saying that liberals are ruining everything  he is pretty apolitical to me.some politics may be used in his stories but I dont think he actually cares about americas two party squabbles.so what are you saying if not that
@chandlerburse2754  man  thats too much to read atm. might check it later. however  at a quick glance  I see you have misunderstood what I wrote completely. I never said the joker was a conservative. thats a misunderstanding on your part.
exactly what I thought
I cant decide who is worse dc or marvel.  dc might be worse
same here nick
I agree cuz the only thing that Ive liked out of current dc so far is punchline and thats about it.
youre still giving them money at that point chief.  youre not accomplishing anything
@john dodo  not necessarily. buying a book already at a comic book store does not give dc a penny. the store has already paid them for it. buying digital copies of the same thing  however  would be paying dc.
I haven t bought anything new or old of dc since 2008. I have all I need. I have been done with comics for a long time.
what dc used to be funny you say that because this story youre crying about  which is non canon btw and is a one off joke minI story at the end of a book  was explicitly created to pay homage to the wacky hijinks of dc s silver age stories. so if youreally enjoy what dc  used to be   you ll probably love this story.
duela dent is going to be so happy thatshe s a sister now!
I think the joker mistook pregnancy with the simple gesture of taking a dump.
that thumbnail... lol! made my day.
how is he going to deliver this thing   melonie  I really appreciate what you do but I dont want to think about it!
so first they treat the joker like crap for being the one that  holds harley back  as this stereotypical abusive boyfriend archetype  and now he gets pregnant. its ironic how these kinds of people either treat fictional characters as though they need to be protected by the law or like dress up dolls for whatever propaganda they wanna shove down people s throats
10 years ago he was wearing a skin mask of his own face
the worst thing about this is that another writer is going to  outwoke  him
my God  the look on your face in the thumbnail...
dinner at taco bell will help with his labor.  full delivery in 15mins or less  guaranteed.
loved tanjiro s face  wondering if joker is an upper or lower moon! or maybe muzan himself!
gotta say  this is top notch maniacal even by joker s standard...
no amount of bleach that I pour into my eyes will be enough to help me unsee that image of a pregnant joker.
and they wonder why manga is completely outselling them to the point where more people pirate manga than buy comics.
what s the exit point for this mud baby    I think you just answered your own question
oh no!!!! hey melonie. this is crazy. you did great on tnme
ever since he put that nokia into an inmate s belly to cause an explosion and free himself from gotham prison... ever since then he s wanted  another baby  as he puts it. true story.
dammit  melonie cracks me up!
I think they might have taken this idea from an old ren and stimpy cartoon. stimpy thought she was pregnant   gave birth in a litter box.  raised the turd for 2 years. then accidentally flushed it while potty training it.
you could call this a  back door story line.
I just wanna go back to good stories like the killing joke and the long halloween
either its gonna come out of his mouth or bust out like a xenomorph
@        well you were right about one of those methods
yes
so they steal manga which in turns actually hurts manga  this logic makes the whole logic of gamers who pirate bad games even worse.
thank you  stephen!
@melonie mac go boom hImelonie
wow  this is just the bestest of the best ever to exist in all of comic history  groundbreaking  amazing  amazing .........
oh God! thank you for this! this is the second good laugh I have had today!  the first was the wakanda forever total lack of toy sales
honestly   I am so de sensitized to the route gone in current media   tv movies comics  graphic novels all of it. Im just like the teacher of ferris bueller  level of excite and reactions                         bueller  bueller  bueller  bueller.   I have thatsense of emotional reactions of non anger or anything  dc is my favorite   I loved zack snyders vision batfleck is batman in my heart and if not the flash I think most of the sane snyder fans just want affleck and cavil to get proper solo movie send offs but this comic pregnancy joker I am not surprised. are youreally surprised  boom
this escalated quickly.
I didn t know that joker can get pregnant and have a baby when he is just a male and a man  anyway it is odd and strange for joker being pregnant and have a baby too. anyway this is a great video that you did melonie and I am so happy to give you my thoughts and my comments on each of your videos everyday. also keep it up and I am so happy for you. anyway hope you had a great day today and hope you continuing to have a wonderful and great blessed evening at home and have a good night too melonie.
if they put this in joker 2  would it also be a spiritual successor to junior
the fuck  - cliff steele
I think when gunn said all the books and movies are cannon  someone at dc said  hold my beer.
never in my life would I ever imagined thatsomeone would tell me this until today.
your facial expressions in these thumbnails are gold! in regards to there being a pregnant joker.....
its hard to be dc comics and dcu fan . I grew up with dc  now it feels as if the company wants to constantly go out the way to give me the middle finger
so we need to talk about your facial expression in this thumbnail here.
how...how did he give birth to it  where did it come out of
it does get more cringe than this  should be a t-shirt at this point.
just imagine rippa s reaction
turns out we were the jokers all along.
I laughed so hard I peed I lil bit lol.this shit is pure madness.
omg that thumbnail face was everything
I feel so sorry for the children when they get older and have to live with this bullshyt
at this point Im about ready to watch this world burn  said in a non pregnant joker voice .
the mouth.
me too
I would imagine he will deliver the  baby  in the same way they delivered the story  out of their arse!
now that would make passing a kidney stone seem simple and painless.
when you said joker was pregnant I was like  and who is the father  batman
and they wonder why writers and artists are going  comicsgate
arnold schwarzenegger got pregnant  kinda  in junior.
Im sure this will sell well!
I remember back when carl from jimmy neutron got pregnant  yes there is an episode its s3 e9  who s your mommy    and I thought it was way more weird but not really normalized.
I like how she pronounced ethan s last name   haha
I ll never look at the joker the same way again
melonie should react to the movie  junior  from the early  90s. arnold schwarzenegger gets pregnant.
I guess ezra miller s flash has been busy.
pops whiskey bottle  chugging deeply
this news is everywhere  live your take on this melonie
me trying to convince my brain that the joker just ate alot and his stomach is jutting out.
I agree more with michael knowles  take on this  its actually great bc hes a villain and an insane one at that. it wouldn t be good if it were one of the heroes. on another note  he d probably just poop that baby out  considering its made of mud. gives a new meaning to the term mudbutt.
I knew this guy who got pregnant.instead of 9 months it was for about 9 minutes  and instead of a baby he gave birth to a fart.beautiful story I know..
making money is an action. keeping money is a behaviour  but  growing money is wisdom  I heard this from someone
this situation is just about peak clown shoes.
Im glad to hear carnivore is working for you. I lost 100lbs on keto then hit a wall. I tried carnivore a few years ago hoping it would help me to start losing weight again  but no such lick.
I once was pregnant with a mud monster. damn taco bell.
well said fam!!! my life is totally changed because Ive been earning  15 250 returns from my  4 000 investment with harold warren..
same  here  I will praise mr harold warren over and over again because he has great skills  I started with  2000 and after 2week I received a returns of  6 000 then I continue with him ever since he has been delivering.
I heard a lot of investing with harold warren and how good he is  please how safe are the profit
I traded with him  the profit are secured and over a 100  return on investment directly sent to your wallet.
after watching so many youtube tutorial videos about trading was still making losses untill mr harold started managing my investment now  Imake  6 800 weekly. God bless mr warren. his been a blessing to my family.
@rose mary  please how can I reach out to mr harold warren   I urgently need his management on my investments !
@haroldwarren21
available on t legram messager
@rose mary  thanks alot
wow  Ive seen a lot of recommendation about harold warren  is he really that good.
who wants to see a magic trick    pulls out coat hanger  gives self-shm-shmortion  ta-da! its gone! literally  a clown world.
the movie  junior  was way ahead of its time right
I dont know how anyone could make a video about this with a straight face. dc- dead comics
where do you think the joker is registered   and is the legion of doom pre school program hard to get into
as a dude  Ive dropped a few mud monsters in my time. now I got to ask myself if I flushed something I should have nurtured and raised instead.
to mess with batman even more  joker s going to name the baby  martha
soo many questions...the zack snyder cut of this will be 4 hours long  2 of which are just the joker giving birth whilst making joker noises and lamaze-breathing
I always wanted manly excuse for my bear belly  and now I have it. I am pregnant!
Ive definitely  birthed  a few mud monsters in my day.
this is another example of why Im writing a graphic novel right now. so yall can have a good comic for once.
damn  the joker is good. thats a good one
so  they got rid of henry cavill  but they didn t delete this.okay. I just wanted to make sure.
omg... society is going down the gutter... being open minded aside  this is just  beyond ...
looks like james gunn found his next plot line.
the slippery slope is v real. literally just look around dude
dc has jumped the shark. also  ivy should ease up on that high end plant food. lol...
jared leto s joker is looking like a masterpiece now
the face in the thumbnail sums this all up nicely.
holy shit. I had no idea dc comics were still being published.
that thumbnail is priceless!
yes  harold warren is the best.  he is the only one I can leave my investment with and think less about it  he is my money maker.  I just received  13 000 of my investment last month.  I am very happy because he is leading me to financial freedom.
Im glad to see mr. harold warren mentioned here  my spouse recommended him to me after investing  4000 and he has really helped us financially in times of covid -19 lockdown here in australia
Imake   23 450 weekly trading profit with him  I only trust mr harold warren with my investments. am now able to send my kids to great schools in la  all thanks to mr harold.
I am from denver colorado usa I connected with him and he has helped me a lot  he makes so much profit for me .he made success earlier than we thought.
Im so happy for taking the bold step in investing a little start up capital with after a week I received my profits to my bank
I have never seen any of his clients complain of lost....I think he is just too perfect
@larry flores    please how can I contact mr harold warren   I want to invest with him too.
he s on telegram
@larry flores   thanks for his info I ll get to him right away
believe me  he s the best when it comes to cryptocurrency trading  your profit is assured.
money is wisdom sounds like rubbish.rich people are often hypocrites and stupid.
indie novels are either good or bad.and honestly praising your comic already is not always a good sign.frank miller kind of did that and his comics are laughably insane.albeit I guess still better than this.
always did
@conscious gentile hell no jared leto sucks
thumbnail
stunning and brave.
meanwhile ....... manga laughs in the background whilst rolling in the money
men can get pregnant!  really  Imust have missed that in the sessions on male reproductive anatomy Im obviously kidding which I need to clarify as it is the internet
hope this is canon. it is hardly the strangest thing to hapn in comics. _jc
kinda wondered why you looked a lot younger than you claimed... makes sense now.
for a good while now  modern comic writers have had but two tricks -  xxxxxx but a woman!  or  xxxxxxx is gay now!   I guess this is something new   still off-putting and weird  though.
if the joker is now the sub does that make harley the dom  and thatshe s been changed too...oh my Lord haha
dear dc  we re not laughing with you. we re laughing at you.
so joker somehow gets pregnant and batman isn t the father
the exit point for the jokers mud monster is the same exit point for every man s mud monster we deliver on a daily basis.
imagine have a psychopathic maniac getting pregnant this is a very low blow to the characters and to the readers minds
results of living in a society that threw Godly morals out the window
joker  I finally have the upper hand batman. you wouldn t hit a pregnant man now would you  batman  ... I think Im going to start killing villains.
I sincerely think that this was done precisely for the videos its getting.  no other reason.  some of these creeps know exactly what they re doing.
thats not the joker thats... the woker!
if this is best dc can create I draw them in the swamp.  reference of finnish epos kalevala where hero v in m inen was so powerful that he could sing man in the swamp
well   he is called  the joker .
dont be such a bigot  melonie!
cant wait to see joaquin phoenix adaptation in the sequel. lmaooh bruce wayne will probably the founder of dc s ectolife.
@conscious gentile    its a stepping stone for the uprooting of a society
@chandler burse  whatever your perspective is one thing is for sure -- social collapse hinges on moral depravity   delusional thought process and sexual degradation
@jimmy pena  some people say delusions includes hyper religious people.which depending on how zealous they are I agree as many Christians have gone full blown insane thinking they are prophets or are the ones to judge sinners rather than be judged by God themselves.
what a jokester he is!
Im still trying to finish the batman beyond comics I haven t read any of this stuff  now idk if I ever will read it lol. why just why   idk the full context of the comic but itsounds very similar to what they did in the animated series with clayface but in that clayface sent out a spy that he cloned as a girl cause he was very weak then years passed she found tim drake robin   they liked each other then clayface killed her
banner that reads   its a boy! what it was really meant to say            its a boy borted...
is harley the father   no--Im not going to read the comic for myself to find out.
your face in that thumbnail  bwhahahahaha! you are shook! this majorly grosses me the heck out! you were giving dc too much credit when you were thinking this was a meme  lol  you should know better by now. Im sick and tired of the woke crap in our entertainment. Im sick and tired of the men can get pregnant narative. oh  hey  I see my tweets  nice.
seems like major dark knight returns vibe.
happy new year melonie
this is the type of stuff yurI bezmenov was warning us about 39 years ago!!
something tell me dc hired frost from g4tv and now the joker is pregnant
biggest question.... who got him pregnant !... batman !... futa harley quinn!
you wait till zaslav sees this  he ain t gonna be happy
the fans warned dc about what would happen if they ever went in the direction of marvel. somebody didn t listen.
penguin gets pregnant and lays an actual egg
I remember the good old days when this sort of thing was just the domain of the worst of the worst fanfictions
dont let ethan know you pronounced his surname  skeever
joker is a trans man now
oh and ethan van sciver is pronounced  van sky-ver . he s one cool peep.
wtf!  and they wonder why the comic industry is in a death spiral.  thank God for indy creators!
this reminds me of when adult animated shows would have episodes involving male pregnancies
they say its a clown world  and they finally made the clown funny!  btw  go to the gym  stay hydrated  and practice pew pew!!
more than 39 years ago this stuff was common. why do people all of a sudden think this is new is beyond me.
good question
it was zatana.
@nexusshark   that could actually make sense! fukin hilarious
@adam fr  its the actual canon answer.
as sydney watson always says   welcome to hell .
another day  another character ruined by the woke mob.
you know  I wouldn t be surprised if this was written because the writer has a fetish kink for mpreg  its a thing on the internet .might not be but we ve had the canadian cartoon show meant for children where there was a toot fairy who sniffs the children s farts and enjoys it. and boy do they show it...
melonie s face on the picture made me lol. its the face we all had. dc comics is so trash now I dont even get mad anymore.
Imean thicc poison ivy kinda makes sense
@melanie macare there any plans to put these videos up on rumble as well
dc has gone more insane than the joker himself!!!
melonie did simocast  tuesday nights main event now we need either a pop up on fnt or sunday night mario kart with g g for the hat trick
...sigh...my goodness.  just so much to say about this whole topic  I saw this thing repeatedly on twitter  it just...oh my goodness its so stupid.I routinely commented that dc now stands for  ditch comics   I at one point wanted to write how it made the batman and robin movie look like mask of the phantasm by comparison and I even had the mental image from mario kart 64 where you drive the wrong way and lakitu shows up the shake his finger and scold you for going this way when I tried to think about the story plotting process that actually went into this thingI think I saw ethan van sciver and chuck dixon post about it  I remember commenting how I really liked chuck dixon s work on the batman books way back when  the fanboy in me took over  and how it was way better than this garbage.  Im a longtime dc fan too   stopped reading regularly when the new 52 happened and yeah I really dont have any regrets doing that...goodness this is horrible.great video  embarrassing subject matter but great video!!!
robin  holy bunions! batman joker is pregnantbatman  heading to marvel universe
as a fat person  Im always happy when one of my fat friends can get healthy and lose weight.
I hope batman is paying him child support xd
lol  while you are so right melonie  doesnt this seem totally on point  men pregnant   joker  seems like the perfect explanation to me  a joke!
this is why I stopped reading comics years ago. I saw what was coming and got out early. same goes with the movies.
I think swamp thing has something to do with this
Imean  I did seriously think that this was some sort of weird jared leto story when I first I heard about this.  and forgive me for the imagery but I dont think it is worse than what they did  but when the story said it was a mud man kind of offspring I realized that the joker was just supremely constipated and had been for three weeks before the cheap mexican food finally made the rush through the blockage.and  again  there s a reason I quit reading comics in the 90s.  and there s an even bigger reason why I dont go back.
my gosh. as if there wasn t enough to worry about in the world at the moment I now have to worry about getting pregnant  I cant take care of a baby!
I feel like today s dc comic s writers dont really care about their fan s
the species has finally reached peak human stupidity. at this point  its not even a matter of  what the actual heck  anymore. its officially just  so this is where we re at now  huh   God help us.
I cant  .Lord please just come take us home!! hahaha. wow.
how is this woke  I guess alien nation sliders  even star trek enterprise is woke l...
@gloria thomas  I suppose they could be called the same. or not depending on the way they did it idk
would be cool if it comes out all alien style. it probably wont though  because that would be too cool. in fact they should have had a xenomorph inside of joker. another batman and aliens crossover could have been dope. no. a justice league aliens crossover. dc comics should hire me.
I grew up in a baptist household during the satanic panic. this isn t that  and even as an atheist   I still say you have valid concerns.
this is literally a public service announcement to ditch american comics forever and read japanese manga for life.
so...if batman hits the joker while he s pregnant  who would be the bad guy in thatsituation
what s worse  preganart joker in the comics or lady gaga in the next joker movie
heart ledger and cessear romero just rolled over in their graves reading that in heaven.
melonie  quick question  did youread the comic   also  this isn t the first time that men have been pregnant in media.  Im not sure if youre old enough to remember junior  with arnold schwarzenegger.  its funny how people just accepted that it was fantasy and not reality.  I wonder where the disconnect happened.
so  dc comics  at one time  detective comics  a more serious approach to comics  is on a race with marvel to see who s wokest  I dread to see what comes after this. well  at least more content for fnt. @nerdrotic gary gonna be pissed...
so poison ivy ate the entire garden
the man getting pregnant story isn t new!!! I remember plenty of fiction stories where that happens. they are usually put one person in the other person s shoes stories...or its an alien or monster etc. in 1994 there was a arnold swartzneger danny deveto movie called junior. there was a star trek episode called unexpected where a male crew member has relations with an alien and ends up pregnant. that was 2001. I see what you mean by slippery slope because those fiction stories lead to this story 26 and 21 years later! also if you know comics a lot  a lot  of stories elements are not original. you just need too much content to expect everything to be original. kind of how you need content so you call a nonsense comic story a  slippery  slope and try to make it  something  that will get outrage culture to give you views and likes.
after all the holiday chowing  I also gave birth to a mud  monster.
anyone remember when society was  compared to today  pretty alright...
I was thinking that mud baby was the same as saying his bowels were backed up so mud equals poop. once he does a good colon cleanse he should be good as new.
fake pregnancy is another of the joker s nasty little pranks.
even though it is a sillier non-canon story its still unsettling they forced a child onto zatanna and into joker
joker being pregnant is weird lol.
it is no wonder more people are ditching modern american comics and going for japanese manga.
brave and stunning
imma just gonna go ahead and delete my eyes for a few days you were great tho
how much longer until they start making comics featuring an adult batman and a minor robin man-boy love story and a female superhero with a  loving  relationship with their dog
the joker   men cannot be pregnant
holy cow... ten years ago if someone told me this was our reality. I d say they were writing a fanfiction of reality. wow... clown world
you think you live in clown world   now    - tomorrow
writer may have been self-inserting their m-preg fetish  but they ended up writing a lame story of the joker being infected with an alien parasite. Imean  for an evil genius  wouldn t he be a bit more concerned about it maybe being a tumor
joker s putting cosmo and stewie to shame.
that thumbnail tho
on the poison ivy thing...how do you put on fat if you dont eat fatty foods  like  dont get me wrong. her body works on photosynthesis  which is making glucose  a sugar  so some fat is understandable...but not wolfing down at olive garden levels of husky here! poison ivy being thin and curvy isn t just a  men like sexy dur hur hur  thing. it actually makes sense to the character in mentality  intention  and biology.
by the way... who s the father of joker s unborn child  bruce wayne  xd
Imean  it is a brown mud monster. are we sure joker isn t just really bloated
is that gaggy  in the panel with joker  did they actually bring back gaggy  the joker s incredibly obscure original sidekick from the 1960s  sure looks like him. can anyone help clarify this strange question
this reminds me of what I saw on america uncovered  crazy new laws now in effect in california  which should be on the state flag 1. well meaning  but not well thought out.2. we re not sure if this will work  but we re going through with it anyway.
this is like one step away from sonic knuckles impreg fan fiction. what Im saying is they hired some pervert thats now airing out their fetishes in the comics.
waitso he gives birth... but then has to adopt as his own  wouldn t the child  mud monster  already be his
this is beyond cursed.
dc starting the year off with getting more people to completely nope the hell out the door of american comics.
grats on 100k melonie!
at this point it just feels like dc is trying to fail and is allergic to making money.
Im sure it will sell well
superman  on the other hand  should never kill or be dark or even use foul language. he is a red-blooded  true blue hero  not a monster. what makes superman superman is not that the fella has power or is strong  but his humanity and ability to use restraint is what makes him superman. and he is basically Christlike in his flawlessness. anything else isn t superman. superman is incapable of evil or any form of darkness. its what makes him superman.
my first reaction was not about the joker being pregnant  but about how awful the artwork is.looks like a highschool student copying comics from the 1950 s  and using watercolor to paint.look at the size of the joker s neck and hands  and his skin is grey. he s like grundy s child  but with tiny shoulders.
fittingly  he looks like jared leto joker to me...
I think he was technically brought back in the three jokers story.where even jason points out why the hell is he here again
@chandler burse  youre right  id forgotten that they did that.
yes. the little on shots  like this one  are an homage to the silver age so they have references to that time.
this could  small chance  just dc saying there s no way a man could get pregnant outside of magic. and when I hear  mud monster  I immediately think of clayface - who could have jumped down joker s throat while he was sleeping. this isn t the first time clayface has become the joker  arkham city  - this time he s just a mini-me of joker. the scientific belief that men can get pregnant is absurd - which the joker is all about absurdity. maybe all will be explained in the next issue. of course I could be way off.
...is that one of those stories where a bunch of people sit around and one person starts it off...then another person adds something else...then the next person...then the next person...
I dont worry about what dc  marvel  amazon  netflix  disney  do anymore melonie. they will all u-turn in a while as these woke companies are bleeding money. as ever I suggest that people demonstrate their opinions by considering their purchases and subscriptions.
I think they know adults wont accept craziness as normal  this is why they go after the kids. using comics  cartoons  music  movies  games  even school curriculum is pushing craziness as normal.
he s not pregnant. he ate too many carbs.
dc comics will keep digging until they reach the endless abyss...
what a way to start off 2023
the joker being pregnant is a joke in itself. too bad dc doesnt see it that way though... this pretty much resumes the skit the babylon bee made about a pregnant man come true.
joker would probably do this and then reveal it was a bomb.then again more darker wise he would probably just out a bomb in an actual woman.
he s called the joker for a reason....
hey you guys remember when nicolas thesla  warn us  we may live to see  man made horrors beyond our u  yea I guess the  man made horrors  are indeed spiraling out of our  comprehension
why wont comics sell !
men just dont have the plumbing for carrying a baby. even as crazy as the joker is  even he cant pull it off. even if he s carrying a clayface clone.  unless he got snatched by a xenomorph
isn t batman currently dc s only real success
my expression.questions   who got the joker pregnant   where is the mud coming from
no matter what anybody  even if the creator of joker himself said its canon.. no  it not.
oh how we need dimebag now
Im confused  I have questions. can somebody help me please   does the joker have girl parts now or did he squeeze it outta his bum  if it came outta his bum  are we certain that its mud that we are talking about  who verified this  if it  is indeed mud  who is the father  clayface or batman  at first glance one would think clayface but forcefully shoving semI sentient mud into a career criminals butt crack  that you have chased for years and finally caught up to one night when nobody was around  kinda ... sounds like just the sort of thing a masked vigilante with parent issues would do. but then  I dont know the man so.
this is y manga and anime are beating comics these day
I think they had this joker with the flashpoint joker mixed up
actually most comics are bought by adults now. also  this takes place in a fictional world  populated by 4th dimensional imps  super powered aliens  and clay monsters  and isn t even cannon like she for some reason  views maybe  said it is.
joker was once one of the scariest villains in all of comics. now he is having mud babies. it just shows how comics have gone to crap. great job on tnme melonie.
5 50 you are on the carnivore diet   nice!! Im also on a carnivore diet .. very good diet!! I have lost 90lbs in the past 3 years ..you have won me over .. Im subscribed!!
Imissed the time when it was joker and harley quinn were together. a romatic love story showing villians can find love too. now harley quinn is with ivy and joker is now hooking up with a mud monster. whats next they will normalize them with the hyneas and having their puppies
I gave birth to a mud monster once. my gastroenterologist gave me a good prescription for that.
I stopped buying comics shortly before the new 52 reboot.  I haven t bought one since.  lately  it doesnt sound like a hobby worth starting again.
all I canthink about now is the arnold schwarzenegger movie junior.
poison ivy is definitely overweight  maybe not obese or extremely obese  but definitely overweight. for a woman her shape and size  she s very much well over her correctly proportionate bmi.
I know the perception of dc is always trying to catch up with marvel  but dc went political a long time ago before donner s superman.
fyI  missclick gaming is delivering her baby in a month.
when you think it cant get any worse from the woke crowd  we get pregnant joker  with a mud baby. do youremember when comics used to have actual stories about super heroes and villains  but why would we want actual good content when we can get a mud baby. here you go  let s all feel included now shall we  because we can all relate to being pregnant as a man with a mud baby.....what the actual fuck  - great video melonie  keep going boom
woke women   with advances on in-vitro technology  we dont even need men to get pregnant! joker   hold my mud baby
Im glad you can laugh at this  Im so over this stupid sh t at this point  I dont even want to look at social media anymore.  remember when heath ledger got so into wanting to play the joker convincingly  it really messed with his head   now  we have pregnant green dipstick joker that looks like he was drawn for a tumbler fan art forum.
I prefer dc as well. better villains   better heroes
absurdity of the scenario aside - does anyone here buy the idea that joker would ever be even remotely good as a father  Imean a major part of his character was his abusive  codependent relationship with harley. not exactly a role model family man lmao.
Im sure joker is just severely constipated. mud monster    lmao
manga just continues to laugh its ass off.
Im glad I stopped buying comics. this is nuts!
in an anime horror could see the baby ripping itself through one very small hole.
on top of being pregnant his face  why does joker look so normal  the psycho killer who would murder countless people just to get batman to pay attention to him is now this  thanks  I hate it.
I really thought this was fake. unreal
the story between them wasn t romantic it was abusive and sad harley quinn managed to get into a less toxic relationship with ivy but always managed to go back to the joker regardless
yes he would not be a good father in the slightest
manga is filled with way more fetishes than this. guys were giving birth in manga a decade ago
I feel like dc is smoking crack or doing mushrooms while making these comics as they always find a way to top their absurdity and I haven t really liked anything out of dc as of late except for punchline who is the joker s new girlfriend but she s the only redeeming quality in a sea of absurd wokism.
its always amazing when someone really creative and interesting gets a hold of batman and writes something truly amazing  like the dark knight returns  hush  year 1  death of the family  etc. this is not that  not at all. youre seeing people who lack creativity and vision just insert their strange identity politics and sexual nonsense into batman  because they re creatively bankrupt. its becoming a parody like freakazoid or the tick  or harley quinn  except those are meant to be funny.
I had to like this just because of the thumbnail. lmao.
what a missed opportunity. a love child between joker and harley quinn would have been a better angle. it would have tested harley quinn s maternal instincts  forcing her to question her dedication to a life of crime  and could have revealed the influence of some past struggles joker had with his father  as he grapples with parenthood. I dont know why they keep hiring these untalented writers who tell stories that no one cares to read. well  I guess it all comes down to politics.
so joker gave birth to a  mud monster . so that means he took a crap.
melonie mac go boom  you are awesome.  the joker in the original batman comic books is a murderer with no known background  the joker doesnt have an origin story  and he appears as a murder of murders  that is an archetype   he is a foil for the great detective  that takes down the joker for the good of society  and this makes the batman a hero.  we could claim that d.c. comics wants to go broke  but the joker is already an unlovable ugly clown by design  so that the audience doesnt latch onto him  this ability as a man  for the joker to get pregnant  only makes him more unlovable to the public  therefore  when the joker suffers  we applaud batman.
and this is a prime example of why manga is destroying dc marvel.
so... the message is that if your have a mud monster in your belly your pregnant  throw it up and transforms into a kid joker  bruh... so basically  I just have to eat mud basically
yeah  I just read the story cos I was curious just how and why dc would do this. I think people are giving it more attention than it deserves. for starters its not canon  its a one off joke story. the way I read it is its kind of a fantasy joker is having based on the old batman comics  only the joker is the star. and each comic issue have a new unconnected episode its not even the real story of the comic. its a bonus unconnected 8 page story at the end of the comic. I doubt it would ever be brought up again  except now people are making a big deal out of itso  they may reference it  but it wont be actual canon.if youre curious  in this episode he s harassing zatanna  a superhero thats a magician  by saying they should start a family together  so she punishes the joker by making him pregnant via magic. the next day he vomits up a lump of sentient mud  joker tries to kill it  until the mud shapes itself into looking like the joker at about 6 years old  being a narcist and delusional  joker then raises it and presents it to zatanna as their son. junior  the old arnold schwarzenegger and danny devito  movie takes a man getting pregnant more seriously...
reminds me of the south park where the guy gives birth to bono!
dc and marvel and the other big names haven t gotten a cent from me since this whole woke debacle began.Im still down with mcfarlane and spawn  but thats about the extent of it. the comic industry as a whole has zero appeal to me nowadays.
first    second  I believe a revolutionary idea is not promoted openly in the mainstream media so I ask  which values   are really revolutionary  Christian values or woke values  everyone draw their own conclusions.
joker getting pregnant  not out of the question.he would be  pregnant  for 9 months and give  birth.  kabooom  he gives birth to a bomb and walks away laughing.
cant believe they took one of the best villains and did this. the whole point of the  joker  was chaos. next series to be released will be about how the joker is now a stay at home  dadmom and it follows the issues of home life with joker and clayface. what a joke...
bro we are screwed existentially
this is just a sign that a bunch of low paid  artist and writers  and editors dont care anymore. now they are just trolling until they finally collapse. 20 years ago I used to worry that american comics would fade away. now I just dont care.
things like this make me wonder if God regrets vowing never to flood the earth again.
this is  a joke!
batman has always been my favorite comic hero. this is extremely upsetting as joker is also my favorite villain. what is it with people s obsession with feminizing male characters and vice versa
at this point  joker is the next  orochimaru
conservative incels think joker is about society tho nowadays lol
when I told my friend this.....she used to be a massive fan of dc...she isn t anymore. her eyes rolled so hard the planet shook  on its axis! I am sorry but these stories now are.......just no
joker takes a hefty crap. parades the turd around like its a child. classic joker.wait  this was a south park episode with bono!
now look  Im 66 years old. Ive seen alot of things in my life  but I have never witnessed what the hell is going on like today in this society world. my wife cant stop laughing.  I on the other hand is discussted
thanks for sharing this insane comic.  we are living in a clown world
I cant do this anymore!
comics were always woke.if you bother to read comic history you will see marvel started as  woke . they addressed racism and drugs way before anyone else. marvel got heat for having people of color as heroes in comics - all it takes is reading stan s soapbox.heck - people forget hitler was popular in the usa before the usa joined in wwii. the captain america where he is punching hitler - came out a year before pearl harbor. american nazis came to the at the time timely - what became marvel - to beat up jack kirby for doing the comic.
although the slippery slope argument is a logical fallacy  it is  in fact  a spiritual reality  you gradually head deeper and deeper into sin  the road to perdition is by many small steps... conversely  holiness works the opposite way  you train yourself to have self-restraint  self-sacrifice  humility....we train ourselves in small ways initially  and at becomes greater... you ve been faithful over little  now receive much   matthew 25 23 ....if you train yourself to be disobedient   i.e. self mastery  via fasting  prayer  almsgiving  etc.   in small things  then you are  ultimately  training yourself to be disobedient in great things -fr. andrew stephen damickLord of spirits podcast  fall of man part 2  crouching sin  hidden dragon
Ive given birth to a mud monster after eating at chipotle. but probably not the same thing.
dc comics has been shitting on batman since 1940  the only exceptions are the a very small bitstuff in the early 40 s  some of the 1970 s most 1980s and early 1990s  the two-part tim burton masterpiece of 1989 and returns and most kelley jones artwork batman comics. the best comics were everything from the earliest of the early golden age  the year 1939 bill finger  sheldon moldov  and bob kanes  original vision of the lethal lone vigilante killer. not the pansy superhero with a code of not killing and an endless list of morons that fight crime with him and sends the criminal cunts to jail or arkham asylum filled with annoyingcampy hijinks. which is bs. original batman killed and used firearms. fake batman doesnt kill and has sidekicks. sorry modern batman fantards Im a bill finger purist. original batman was much darker and grittier. bill finger modeled batman after the shadow   lamont cranston . finger did the most of work. kane just did the artwork he wasn t much of an artist but a great cartoonist. kane was a glory hog who wanted to make batman more heroic at the behest of jerry robinson  who created robin and wanted to make the comics more family-friendly. finger envisioned batman as a lethal gothic avenger motivated by revenge  not justice. bill finger eventually caved into studio pressure to bastardize his own comic because it was deemed too dark and disturbing.
Im also a fellow batman fan. but due to all the regressive nonsense we re witnessing  I turned more to anime. its a shame though  I used to really enjoy dc media especially the old ones
I honestly dont think this one is a big deal. the joker getting pregnant sounds like a pretty funny storyline  exactly the kind of goofy shit that would happen in that world. it reminds me more of something like arnold schwarzenegger s movie  junior   where arnold getting pregnant is the root of the comedy. its supposed to be funny  and it is. the fact that it happens to the joker makes itseem even more like a joke  not like some kind of sinister woke propaganda. I can even imagine wokies getting mad about this for being insensitive to trans people or something. I think we need to point out woke crap when we see it  but this ain t it. let s not overreact and get all offended by nothing like the wokies do.
when I saw that panel  Im like  bro  you just drew cringe. .
the amount of people upset about a fictional comic book  in a world with super powered aliens  4th dimensional imps  magic glowing rocks  and where martian manhunter already shape-shifted into a woman back in 93  that isn t even cannon  elseworlds  is hilarious. guess that outrage industry really works.
thats going to be one huge chestburster...
and just think  grown  supposed  adults actually sat in a room and wrote this stuff.I really dont understand their mindset here. both marvel and dc are doing the same thing. why would you deliberately hire people who dont understand comic books  have no idea how to write comic books  and basically have nothing but contempt for comic books and comic book readers  its like the fire department hiring convicted arsonists. what s even crazier is nobody is buying these books! sales for the big 2 are in the toilet  yet as melonie said they just keep right on doubling down with this garbage. continuously hiring unsuccessful writers and editors to write books that dont sell goes against every single common sense business practice. when a facsimile edition of the amazing spider-man  1 outsells all your new books  you ve got a problem.
so  I take it you ve never watched any of the  young justice  series    Imean the latest one  not any of the older ones aired before around maybe 2017-2018 .dc has been  out-woking  marvel for quite some time now... heck  the whole reason marvel even rushed out the sub-par  origin story  for captain marvel was because dc  out-feminism d  them with wonder woman wanna know what s really funny though   20 years from now the next generation of  rebels  will be trying to find ways to be  more progressive  than the alt-left today.  so  just think of what they ll be coming up with to  shock  their  unwoke  parents
so he  gives birth to a mud monster .dc went and stole the  he took a big old shit and raised it as his son  idea from an episode of south park
so  dc did a lightyear  no wonder comic book sales are declining faster every year  with this type of crap they put in their stories.
looks like poison ivy is on the vegan french fry diet lol.
Imean  content aside for a moment  can we also talk about how amateurish that art is and how pathetic the writing is  some random guy wearing a quilt saying like a robot  I think youre pregnant.  and joker  the joker saying  just as robotically   I think youre right. what the fuck is happening  Im not a fan of comic books  dont think Ive ever read one in my life  but this is bad. people should be fired. no joke  hitmen have been paid to remove people for work this shoddy. Im not saying thatshould be done. Im only pointing out that people have died costing companies as much money as this will.
you are a reasonable person.
@razoro2productions   and they re doing a good job of it  too.
I dont think I want to live on this planet any more. someone book me a one way ticket on the next artemis mission.
what the hell  dc !  even the batman who laughs isn t this sick and twisted.
deep breathing intensifies   ...stay calm... ...stay calm... Im trying very hard not to explode into a total blasphemous rage... and Im starting to fail. for fu---- kicks table over on the way out
so he shat out a mud baby.... to quote dodgeball  thats a bold move cotton let s see if it pays off for them.
love your thumbnail
we truly live in a clown world.
I buy marvel   dc comics every month.... 20-year-old issues  when the writing was good.
merry Christmas melonie
Im just going to be honest at this point its obviously them trolling the fans they know that they get the fans riled up by doing crap like this and what hurts us the most is that we give it the attention they re looking for maybe if we just stop reporting on this crap they feel like the typical boyfriend or girlfriend that gets ignored and it makes them madder so just ignore this crap dont even report on it thats what they re looking for attention they got nothing else going for them but attention so let s stop giving them attention that they re looking for.
this is like fetish fanfiction.
when you dont think the world can get any dumber  they prove you wrong.
the wokie s hijacked everything I used to love..
as a man I have been pregnant in the 5th month for 10 years. still waiting to deliver.
as they say   life reflects art mental illness seems rampant in the entertainment business.
mud monster   he just had too much taco bell
honestly at this point if you give these companies money for anything youre the problem.
I was in the hospital last summer. I was pregnant and got a mud monster  too. I showed it my doctor  and he flushed it down the toilette. now my mr. muddy has to live in nuremberg s sewers. with his brothers. a lot of brothers!
so...I guess entertainment is dead now  Imean ...im at a loss for words now.
its official  the world of comic books has officially lost its mind. honestly its gone absolutely insane. what kind of crazy ass drugs were they taking  what the fuck is going on in the world of comic books ! ! !
joker would be fine with just a dad bod.
are you a fictional character in a world populated by 4th dimensional imps and clay monsters
so is poison ivy gonna hook up with velma from scooby doo
hImelanie you probably hear this stuff all the time and Im so sorry for that but I heard you mention on one of the streams that you did keto and you go to the gym a lot you dont need either one if anybody told you otherwise or has you thinking otherwise they re wrong so please enjoy your life and dont worry about your appearance because you look awesome..
ummmmmm . . . wait . . . . whaaat    I feel like maybe Imight not be able to sleep tonight . . . or ever again !
Jesus. thats all I can say about this news.
I delivered a mud monster once. it was after a trip to taco bell
the usual mud monster route  I gave birth to one two hours ago.
just restart humanity at this point. hit the button! do it!
omg  this is real  holy hell  what is going on
I heard mud baby and first thought food baby
is the guy in the comic wearing a kinky strapped suit and a choker
love the thumbnail.
poorjoker. now he has to deal with stretch marks
Im still processing it
how did that baby get in there  and much more important  how is it going to get out
I am pregnant too. I smoked a brisket last night and ate about 3lbs of meat.
I think the new dc comic is fulfilling the prophecy from family guy in which they a cut away scene where peter was a child and his broster showed him her peginus.maybe the dc spin is thatself replication and reproduction is possible if you have the combo genitals.https   www.youtube.com watch v xz3kvu_qdao
sooooo joker ate to much taco bell and is now having a mud monster build up inside him
back in my day we called men getting pregnant having a food baby  but I guess mud monster makes more sense.
dc has been incredibly woke for the past couple of years now. Imean just look at the shows on the cw.
peacemaker made butt babies canon in dc  plus would mud monster be like clay face
jack black and kyle had a butt baby episode.
men can get pregnant  thats news to my wife.
I have only one question   why
geezus  what happened to poison ivy  was she stung by a bee or having some sort of allergic reaction  cuz she s all swollen up and gotten big.
I dont think I could possibly role my eyes as much as deserved
to answer your question  the  mud baby  comes out joker s mouth. thats right  he pukes it out.
first time I ever up-voted a video I couldn t finish .
do we have a good obgyn   thats coming out of the jokers mouth joker should be screaming bloody murder and ordering his goons to get him a coat hanger
ok just to clear a few things  the baby is made up zatanna s magic and he puked the baby up
r.i.p dc
so the joker is gonna go boom!!!
is punchline the  father
jokah gonna shoot confettI out
lemme guess batwahman is the father....I know where this timeline leads  Im building an ark. 300 cubits right
I would be mad if it was robin that was pregnant. batman and his ward
how do you adopt your own baby
male seahorse  noticed you copied my style
but... but why  dc why do they want to fail soo badly lol
oh man.. joker s been sagging his pants.. he s carrying a cheesebaby....
dc s bold move  make @thebinaryrecoil blacklist us!they succeeded flawlessly. I will actively refuse to financially support them  eternally now.
haha nice
I think my brain just broke .
we live in a society.
I ll take it.
so someone in dc has a mpreg fetish.and suddenly  compared to the writers  joker is  in fact  the sane one.
will batman be the Godfather
went to tacobell yesterday and spent the whole night in the bathroom giving birth to mud monsters.
lol... nuff said!
if its a  mud  monster  then I give you two guesses about where it comes out and the first one doesnt count.
I used to like dc alot with batman beyond the justice league and teen titans and now that Im older Imiss dc haha marvel really destroyed them this past 15 years hopefully dc can do some cool stuff again
well  this isn t new really. hollywood already had a movie about this way back in 1994 with arnold and danny devito with junior...
the baby will exit like in alien.
better off reading fanfiction
so this like chestburster type of deal  -p
Im so confused by the state of the world  and its lack of simple common sense... I think Im just gonna take a break from the internet for a while.
is it possible that this panel was a joke and someone is making fun of the jokers potbelly
hey melonie I was wondering if u were interested on doinganother military challenge likeu had done before  cya nextime on your next video.takecare melonie
where does the baby come out of
joker doesnt have a womb...
seems legit.
the mud monster is a doo doo baby
dc is outrageous lmao!
Im pretty sure lesiban poison ivy s comic book wont sell
you know its coming out the rear.
itseems that dc is allergic to making money.
the birthing joke
whenever those clowns claim its cannon tells us its not cannon and never will be
10 20 outwoking  its a race for the wokest!
what has dc become  xd
when they cant justify their sh tty films and tv serials cos they break canon and lore  they just change canon and lore.
imma go back and take a nap.
we live in full on
this makes sense bcuz this has to be a joke. just like when we are kids and dont know where babies come from so u have  butt babies
wtf this is exactly why I have which completely over to manga no woke bs there
2 53  normalizing the message .3 56 -- nudge theory.
can we stop the madness please
I get that the joker is a subversive guy but this is just sad.
a pregnant man giving birth to a mud monster  there are so many inappropriate jokes that could be made about the delivery.
what is the ob gyn supposed to be looking at  under the hood
ryan murphy tried pushing some ridiculous male pregnancy story arc on american horror story. I haven t watched another episode since.
this is nothing new. remember when the terminator got pregnant by danny devito
dude doesnt need a c-section. just some laxatives.
I think dc has crapped the bed with the joker s mud monster baby at this point.
think  play-doh fun factory  - kid ll be 18 feet tall and a half-inch in diameter.
what traumatizing life event lead someone into thinking this was a good idea
dc and warner are on the very verge of bankruptcy ngl. with this thing out  its the end of warner and dc
so the joker had a butt baby
I gave up on movies sports and comics when they started playing to the sick minds of the world   when they were all about entertainment  they gave people a chance to escape the bs  but they made the decision to be apart of it and shove this crap down the throats of everyone
so dc has been rebooted for this  hmmm
I guess comics aren t made for me. anymore. a regular comic book fan.
pitchfork time !!
wasn t this an episode of south park  the one with bono
the joker is pregnant with a mud monster....so is the father....clayface
bring back the comic code authority
hmm I used to get called a little shit wen I was a little pup...ah wonder if there s a connection
I thought people were crazy when they were saying thanos was right... now  Im less sure.
my question is who impregnated the joker
hersey squirts
like riper says  dead company!
two words  butt baby lol
clowns can get pregnant too...dont be
@chandler burse  50  chance of avoiding this conversation. also  satire.
Lord have mercy
the end is near!
lack of entertainment channel says it is bait.
but james gunn is going to fix everything!!!
I dont know if the writer failed biology or was making a really cringe poop joke
who is this comic book aimed at
my poor eyes!
melonI what did you do.
Imake a mud monster every morning  ladies!
the joker gave birth to a mud monster  in other words  he took a dump. I just gave birth to triplets.
he barfs it out  how else do u give birth
mud  dis doo doo baby
I wonder who signed off on this and what drugs they were on
@meloniemacgoboom      joker needs an ob-gyn  more like he needs a proctologist.
dont all mud monsters come out the bum  Im feeling a bit prego too come to think of it
where the fuck is david zaslav when you need him !  quick  the zaslav signal!!!
I  on the other hand  would rather not know how a man gives birth.
my belly has gotten bigger. I hope I dont poop out a mud baby
I dunno given the right spicy indian food Ive birthed a mud monster or two lol
I dont want to live on this planet anymore
so I guess they want batman comics to sell as poorly as everything else they publish.
ok  I think the simulation is glitched  we need to go back to a more stable version.
is batman the father
what the hay ! - where do I find this issue   wow !
aw hell nah
mudd monster  its gotta be gas   mudd-butt
let s all laughat an industry that doesnt learn anythingtee hee hee hee !
its a mud monster!!! what exit do you think
I have simple question. with whom
remember that trans woman who  became  a man and then was pregnant and claimed that a man could have a baby.  except  she  still had all the plumbing downstairs so of course she could have a baby.
I gave up talking about modern comic book releases from the big two last year. this is ridiculous!
5 08 sky-ver
its all going to burn.
actuallynothing newjunior with arnold schwarzeneggerfairy oddparents at least  back than they treated it as something  anormal
I believe another channle called clownfish tv said the joker delivered the baby by throwing up.
when dc runs out of ideas
Imiss days when we had evil ernie or tim vigil faust comics..dc and marvel now just plain white bread and water no flavor these days
im just switching to anime manga
w. t. f.
oh God  what s happening
you didn t need to say anything. itshould ve been an 11 45 minute video of you laughing nonstop.
its a mud monster  it comes out of the butt.
marvel let s liberalism kill its reputation dc comics   hold my beer
commenting to feed the algorithm
melonie I would rather  watch avatar 2 than any superhero movie thoughts
d.c. stands for degenerate comics now
I have been lately watching dc and am usually marvel fans but firing the justice league actors n now this am done. I thought dc would take advantage of marvel being woke as an advantage to make good stuff but turns out there taking stuff to the extreme.
no please  I refuse to believe this is canon. please say it ain t so. all jokes aside I really hope this is a joke but if its not then Imight consider reading manga instead or any other book for that matter.
which hole will it come out of....oh God
and this is where I continue to not buy or support them.
Jesus Christ is this just someone s fetish  how do they let them do this !
are they trying to kill dc comics intentionally  like when a failing restaurant suddenly burns to the ground  sure seems that way.
when I heard joker was pregnant I thought oh it must be a alt world version cause I think a female version exist but this no.
all these companies  try to see who can out woke each other. cant watch much nowadays
they did this with arnold schwarzenegger decades ago.  no one liked it then either.
what in the name of sheila is going on in this world what in the name of shayla
its 100  a political message
insanity
a mud monster  ..... the sounds like a lingo for a huge poop
no  Im just fat  p
everybody knows that mud monsters come out yer butt. I give birth to one everyday.
I was done with all of this since they fucked up the killing joke movie with the rooftop bonage scene
oh comic what will you think of next actually dont answer that
I consider nothing past 2000 in marvel or dc canon.
who is writing this filth  most iconic villain is now pregnant!!
facepalm
so joker is having clayface s muddbut baby  I bet he gonna regret co-starring in thatshizer movie. next issue he s probably going to go to social security for ebt.
joker     you cant hurt me anymore batman because I identify as a disabled pregnant transwoman! embrace my bulge you bigots !
but...but why  though
soo prego with a mud monster...sounds like the day after tacos tuesday.
that why demon slayer was able to outsell marvel dc comic book most likely the marvel dc comic book industry is going to died the same way as the arcade
the only place I think it can come out is the but hole
what next batman is pregnant  facepalm
I would just walk away Im glad I stopped reading comics
um... sweetie... I think we all know where the  mud baby  will make its exit...
I am also dumbfounded by all of this  it does feel like a joke coming from joker but also pushing the narrative going against basic biology
its a mud monster. it ll come out the same way all mud leaves your body....
1 45 um  I dont think you can say  mud baby  anymore. just fyi. _jc
I think they forgot an important fact.....I know its shocking   but men dont have uterus.
does marvel and dc not like money     I dont get how they can continue to make crap and lose money in the process
melione mac  geeks and gamers  yellow flash  ryan kinel. all of these youtuber have the same type of reaction because they know dc gone woke and further beyond
this is a joke right  pun intended.
wtf !!
I was so disappointed in this video because Im male and pregnant................ Im sorry forget what I said it was just painful gas.
whatthehell !
dont look down dc. but there seems to be a large shark  under your skis.
nah.. he s just badly constipated.
imagine having not the discipline to work out and no self-esteem  so you feel offended by others working out and not wanting to die.  they are the same people who say  your body your choise  if its about pregnancy. but here suddenly its their business if you do something for your body and work out  or not.hypocrits. awful. its so stupid. dont they recognize all their contradictions  really !  greetings from germany!
I guess its a good thing their sales and readership are zero.
oh God I cant
1984
but why
just reading that has given me secondhand embarrassment for the writers and dc comics in general. what the actual frack
what the actual......... nm Im not even surprised at this point. smh.
who is this for  who wants to read about the joker being pregnant
girl hollywood is dying in a year or two you will be able your own movies and tv shows on your pc
I bet whoever did this doesnt know why men and women are capable of some things and not capable in others for example biologically women have wider hips so thatsomething like childbirth is actually a thing.for anybody in the comment section I really dont care what youre feeling are those are scientific facts.  so you need to thank God that it is that way it is  because a lot of you guys if you knew what the actual pain of that is. even I cant imagine that.update  I want to know some tips for fitness as I do want to inspire my girlfriend to become a better version of herself so if there  is anything you can actually suggest I would be very grateful. there is a tattooed model I know by the name of veronica gomez and yes I do know her personally I even gave her a destiny 2 cook book for a Christmas gift and she was like a little kid when she opened it  but I digress. of course she can always get a push from her  but a little more encouragement couldn t hurt. especially if I can be creative with cooking any of those meals that are good  but itstill good for her.
Im done with dc and mc. no more. I ll keep my money from here on out. 2023 officially killed the comic industry.
of course they are denigrating motherhood again
hacks have taken over every creative industry  most dont even have talent.
how old are you  btw
I thought it was south park.
exit is clearly the mud hole.
where s common sense when you need it
is harley quinn the baby daddy
this is obviously reach around to the woke community  getwokeyouknowtherest
so I wonder how far dc can go  is just  a joke  and a bad one.
dc - the ultimate joke...
me - am - love - muddy - mudskipper!..... - not - mud - baby!
really why not just change the corporate name to  ac dc comics
well      now go drink some water.
mud baby.  think about it.
we really are living in the end times now. the world is broken  society is lost and the people in power are corrupting the youth with disgusting ideologies. this is not even funny anymore. its disgusting.
no! seriously  how joker get preganenat ! if joker have starch marks  have has muddbabby b4 !
we as a country are literally circling the drain  men are literally appropriating women and we re just like we need to accept them. sick and tired of this craziness  get me off this crazy train already.
esg scores..
dc writers need to lay off the drugs
the woker
its a joke!
leave my baby mama joker alone hes hormonal..give him or her or bug a break
its time to call boycottman to the rescue!!! lolbut seriously. if he is pregnant  where is the modern mother to take care of him  or did she go buy a cigarette and disappear and I foresee with this wave of woke material a huge opportunity for independent authors to stand out. wake up people but dont get woke. lol
you guys are still reading american comics
Jesus Christ ...
they re too far gone and zaslav isn t some saver of warner dc  so ef em...
he is going to take a giant crap  and have a mud monster
dc out woking marvel lol
wait  he s prreganatened with a boy and its not a male androgenous harley quinn  the woke is failing
yeah... manga is killing it and we have this nonsense...
this is bait...
the seem to have run out of ideas in the writing department.
I wish people were normal
its time to stop
after new 52 all comics just went down
wat ya meen cuh
I still cant believe thats artwork from a comic in the year 2023 ! it looks like something out of a newspaper strip. just horrible.
dc has been going downhill for quite some time. this takes the cake.
new lara has a..............................
youre trolling right
suspension of disbelief is getting stretched to the point of .... uhm.....no.
the story is not canon  it is an elseworld story so none of this affects the main plotline. its just a joke albeit a rather poor one at that...
are you pregnant mel
i-what the fuck.
simple solution to stop them making this crap - dont buy it.
and shit like this is why dc is going down the drain  yeah the comic and movie divisions are seperate but still
I dont want to live on this planet anymore. some people just dont want to understand basic biology.
wish id have known this before I impregnated my wife twice  we could have shared the burden and id have been guaranteed a boy.
its a tumor!
dayumn this is why I love manga instead of comics anymore. dc and marvel is corny after this one lmao if I wanted to see some fuckkkkedup shit I would just watch chainsaw man at this point
male pregnancy in entertainment is nothing new as it has been in alien nation  sliders and star trek  enterprise  just to name some shows.
abomination
it was zantana who did this to him  bull shitstory line.
ahaha... cough  ahaha..fanfic as its dumbest.
I impregnate my mouth with food almost daily.  also  with water.  what I give birth to is not sentient  though.  unlike women.  they can birth literal geniuses.  and the kind of people who made this comic  unfortunately.  double edged sword I suppose.
what in the seasme seed fuck did I witness
how do you afford a carnivore diet   dodd it cause the dehydration   hope you feel better.
hey beautiful lady    why dont you get with other youtube show hosts and form your own comic book universe  you could be boomer
how does it birth  I suppose you ve seen itsince this video  but he uh  spreads his legs on a table like a woman.
he is male. how is he pregnant
instructions weren t clear  blew up my car  thanks
with a butter baby maybe
@melonie mac go boom
y melonie y
thats not mud...
that reads like a bad fanfic on a3o written by a pansexual nonbinary fairy living in their parents  basement.
.mud lol ..its just living poop  diarrhea monster. anyway  the society today is getting out of hand.
the cringe is too much sometimes
that act work is horrible
wooooooowwwwwwww smdh
were bad ones when it fails  2023 will be end of these business.
tbf  Ive been pregnant with a mud monster before. but my relationship ended with it upon delivery.
dc   double the cringe
they turned the joker  into a punchline.isnt the idea of having a supervillian to make him someone everyone fears dc for me had better iconic villians and superheroes than marvel.epic levels of stupidity what both are doing to the brand  a textbook on how to destroy it by catering to the fringe .
yo  wtf
yeah time too bring back asylums    thanks  jfk and reagan
joker s offspring should have been non-binary.
modern day feminism  taking away everything that makes a woman special and giving to men one comic at a time.
another thing goin down in the grey part of history. this woke sht is gonna look real funny to us in the future when we dont care about identity politics anymore
I only thing that I have to say is what the actual fuck
soooo this whole time joke was a trans ! ! what a twist lol
the joker is a woman. what a shock  the joker used to be an arch  criminal that matched wits with batman. now he is a stunning and brave pregnant woman. dc has sunk to new low. why not harley quinn gets pregnant
this is as dumb as marvels pregnant spider-woman fighting crime and saving spider-man because...
crikey...
mud monster...the point of entry and exitseems painfully obvious
thanks melonie for the disgusting content!  I hate it!  the subject matter that is . on the other hand  Im not gonna shoot the messenger since the video presenter is pretty funny  be a real shame to lose her
of all the characters to be fat. poison ivy should never be one of them.
what... the... actual...  @   is going on with modern-day comics  God this truly has gone downhill since james gunn became dc s movie boss
I think I just became no longer a fan of dc. very sad.
obviously this is satire  why is everyone so sensitive. no one in real life cares
what is a man
dc and marvel comics is a tax right off for them. thats why they release
hoenstly.. not even close to the wierdest thing thats happened in comics.. by comic standards this is fairly mundane.
dc published this ! look at this  art . this looks like stuff a friend of mine was trying to draw in junior high. its horrific!
meep
baited....
so dc comics is now stealing ideas from 1990 s movies  namely  junior  1994 . nice  get ready for an up-in-coming lawsuit dc.
the pro-lifers should just be happy that he kept the baby and didn t get an abortion.
is batman the father... gross
yea I think a c section is probably the safest chance of delivery  and staying a live   yea making men to become women   I guess that is the goal and make to be a normal and good thing   how sad how so sad  that we are here in human history and not embracing the way our wonderful creator has made us .
what
come on melonie its 2023 men can get pregnant keep up lmfaoo to be honest this is why I stopped buying comics years ago smh so sad.
could use a good laugh in these hazy days  thanks for that
also  I thought that ivy was fiona from shrek
thats not funny at all! unless he farts out laughing gas and it turns out to be one big killing joke.
this why comics are failing and have been for some time. they need to just stop
parody  stupidity  brainwashing attempt
who is this joker parody aimed at ...obviously  this parody is aimed at a very limited demographic.the joker used to be a cool dude  now he s being used to advance a particular agenda.
you cant make this stuff up bruh... unless youre an agenda driven dc writer
welp.....Im done......I cant take this woke crap anymore.....
not humanly possible.this is why mainstream comics are a total joke these days.this is not canon.
how low in ideas they are that ripoff the idea from  junior   thank God Im reading berserk  thatshit is the goat  the goat!
I quit
the real question is  which losers are paying money for these woke comics
would.
a more pressing question than what exit point is this going to take is where exactly is this little mud monster uh. . .gestating  I guess. joker doesnt have a uterus  last I heard  so how exactly would an offspring of any sort  natural or not  be hanging out inside him also  what is the deal with that art style  that looks like complete garbage. for both the joker and poison ivy comics  the art style is completely amateurish.
this world is a complete loss now is there anyway to just jumpstart the rapture already
I thought comics were made for children. why would any of this be in children s media  I dont understand that  unless it is to groom their is no other reason for something like this to be in comics
who asked for this
already shocking enough that the joker is pregant. woke ass comic. but secondly  why is the art so bad ! joker looks like he has on lipstick.
blasphemous.
what sponsor has this company  Imean people will not buy this shit  right  at least majority of people.
mud  baby... like in  dirt  party .... yuck
God bless you for covering this ridiculous nonsense from the woke narrative! check out  satanic panic  from a  Christian metal  band called impending doom .
actually comics are mostly bought by adults now.
what the heck  leave our stuff alone! geesh...ok batman who laughs.. take out this trash would ya
Im not interested in superhero movies or books anymore. they are so cringe and boring nowadays.
ridiculous
and what is up with this artwork  it looks like a child s coloring book!
we wont like this
I cant wait for batman and robin to have a reassignment surgery and adopt a bi-racial lgbt child and stop fighting crime and instead fight the patriarchy
is anything about the joker supposed to be normal  why cant it just be plain amusing rather than trying to push politics for once
why are the art crap in these new comics  I read comics when I was a kid and the art was much much better. these look like sunday paper comic art style.
yeah no thank you
this is not canon. its a joke one off short story at the end of the book. its just a lighthearted homage to the wacky silver age stories. youreally are just making a big deal about nothing.
its a mud monster so its clearly just a  pile of shit  just like the story. xd it feels like a bad fanfiction. lul.
ah  you shouldn t have made a video on this. its obvious bait.
someone didn t read the comic  this was a side story.he also got cut in half by a subway train and got his bottom half replaced by a gorillas.please research before having a problem with something. we all care about truth right not everything is woke .
this isnt cannon        its cancer
8th
dc     dumb comics
everything sucks. I hate dc now. Im done.
the dialog is just as bad as this terrible self-insert fanfic.
clown show no pun intended.... forget dc  comics are dead
no! this will never be canon! dc and marvel is dead...
no not really joker is very not normal.I guess due to the way comica have been going if this was an amusing satire people find it hard to tell.
nope its real
@js pe a    its bait.   nope its real. thats not the contradiction you think it is.
@john duquette  how do you mean
@john duquette  nevermind figured it out.
@js pe a  its something they did  its in the comic  its canon. those things are all true.its also bait.how it happened in the comic has to do with something that makes sense in comic book universe logic  zatana cast a spell on him to make him impotent or something  and it went wrong.its cringe and unfunny  but not out of sorts.they put it in that way because its actually not pushing anything woke there  its just comic book silliness.here s where the bait comes in  they know it resembles something woke at a glance  and they ve conditioned the people they dont like to read wokeness into everything they put out. because in its narrative context its not woke  and youre reacting as though its putting out a woke message  it makes you look crazy. its trolling 101.
@john duquette  well people already think we re crazy but whatever. plus  I dont think the current writers are thatsmart but  Im not always right.
@john duquette  hmm  I dont know if I agree with everything you say  but for the moment  I ll take your word for it until otherwise.
yea but there s a cottage industry to play of people s outrage even if its over nothing  and get views and money for it.
this ish is hoooorrrrrrrible!!! not only is the premise  incredibly s up1d  its also drawn horrrrrribly also. but thanks for covering this guuuuurrrlllll
as a joker fan  I effing hate this. its the most out of touch  mentally handicapped writing Ive ever seen from dc in my life.
I liked both dceu  and mcu  but... they both suck... so...manga is better  as well as anime.
batman. dcs only major selling comic....they want to ruin that why also what the hell is this art  Im glad I stopped buying comics f all these people.
the artwork sucks.
not my canon  thats fo damn sure. feel free to keep tanking your business with this garbage non-fanfiction.
er no its not   I have just one word  junior . we all survived that movie in 1994  sometimes I think the so called  woke agenda  just do things to wind you up  its hilarious. the funny thing is you are just doing what they do  you are being triggered by a humorous fantasy situation  these things happen in comics.
gay
anything that pisses off the right Im for lol.
I assume youre a homosexual
@bryan  they could be but why make assumptions
