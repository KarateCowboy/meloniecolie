we first need activision to define what a women is  bet dollars to donuts they cant. keep up the incredible work melonie! only found your channel a few weeks ago and it is a breath of fresh air!
Imiss the days were people were hired based on their merit and skill set rather then their race and gender.
there is no hope in activision-blizzard at this point  I dont think even microsoft acquisition will help rebuilding this company image...also  as a non-believer I find  verse of the day  section quite refreshing  I have never seen anyone speaking so freely about their fate and all quotes that you are sharing are really inspiring.keep booming melonie !
I covered this yesterday. started my video with the statement  roughly   so it appears blizzard ran out of women to abuse so they are mass hiring more
never stop being honest.the way to make positive change is not by being part of a tribe.  its by trying to shape the culture and support good things.  not being on a political team.
melonie  you said itso many words  it is no longer about one political party vs another but about the politicians vs the people. I appreciate you and thanks for your channel.
keep up the good fight. I admire your earnest sincerity and your faith. unfortunately  the creative industries have been hijacked by spiritually empty people  deeply unhappy with their lives and lashing out because they dont know how to fix them. their  justice  is little more than mob rule and giving themselves permission to be cruel and vindictive.
hope you ll be on fnt again soon melonie its a big community out there!
awe melonie we love what you bring to this channel. keep being you and fighting the good fight. we will keep praying for you.
you have easily become one of my favourite youtubers in the last few weeks  because youre real with everything you talk about on your channel. I honestly dont know how helpful commenting on your videos is in the long run  but know for certain that there are people who hold the same views as you do.psalm 27 verses 13-14 are words that Ive held close to my heart and need to keep coming back to. thank you so much for reading out the word - people need to hear it even more than they know. keep standing strong for Christ  melonie!
as a straight white male. Ive only ever been hired based on my ability to work. maybe once or twice the manager had the hots for me. but I was also way over qualified for the position.
also youre a blessing to this community many people are being exposed to a great example of what a Christian is because of what you do.
not gonna lie  the end of this video got me emotional. please continue to let us know what we can do to help!
thank you so much for stressing how important it is to walk daily with Christ  melonie!  you and your videos are so great and encouraging!
the whole  uglification  of already settled characters is a weird twist on the old gaming canard of  visuals or story   if the game looks terrible  how s the writing  if the writing s terrible  how are the visuals  which is more important  to pretenders  itseems that they want the visuals only a very specific way  and the character tends to degrade with it. I would absolutely play a game with a visually uninteresting character if the story is engrossing. Ive tried to watch several of disney s newest offerings and I just cant get past the first couple minutes because the characters are horrible...
keep the power going girl! love your content and watching it daily. actively fellow you daily on fb  twitter and instagram.
never did I think when I joined this channel would I be getting a Bible quote of the day. Ive always had a bad taste in my mouth when it comes to church  I was apart of one of those really judgemental churches growing up  but I feel like this is helping me want to stick my toe back in it. so thank you melonie  and God bless
thank you.  just found your channel.  boy did I need to hear it and youre  making an impact on others.  I hope you dont stop any time soon.
love your videos melonie.  when you were talking about politicians being puppets and corporations youreally made me think of the 80 s movie they live.  I think you would really enjoy it  its even more relevant today.  put on the glasses!  it has probably the best one liner of all time too..you will know when you hear it lmao
activision blizzard hiring for diversity points instead of skill   merit will totally go over well  lol. speaking of industries that hate Christians  funimation hates Christians  Imean  just look at how they treated vic mignogna  so its been creeping into the anime industry too and its a damn shame. I love you too  mel and I will always support you. also  you have no idea just how much your support for the job interview that I got a year ago as well as the support   advice for my diet meant to me. words cannot describe it. you are a super good person  friend  streamer   content creator. all those  friends  who treated you like trash and unfriended you because of your faith  opinions   views did not deserve you and were never truly your friends to begin with. your real friends such as myself accept   love you for who you are and will stick with you to the end  no matter what. keep being your true self   doing what you are doing  mel!
well... Imean  they re not biologists.
Imean just look at the quality of the stuff we buy and or watch. its clear as day your point
their argument is going to be that yhe talented ones did hortible things so we gotta go with these other ones
nick  that exactly I was about to text.
Imiss the days before that  when people were hired because they showed up at the front door.
this is becoming more of a thing because of the glass ceiling issues that women have faced in the decades prior to our modern era
Imiss those days when girls didn t feel forced to play videogames or to go to engineering school because hey it must be 50 50. I also miss those days when women went to laying down bricks  build roads and bridges  work at oil extraction plants  and repair deep sea cables. oh wait.
@marco maltese  lol so any girl who plays video games is being forced to huh
@underthegun897  you seem to have some problem in understanding simple sentences.
@marco maltese  oh Im understanding quo quite alright
@underthegun897  no you clearly dont.
@marco maltese  I didn t know women felt forced to play video games or go to engineering school.
@marco maltese  no its really not  sounds like you just have a problem with females doing things you like
lmao
this all my this. Im not the most spiritual person but Ive always kept or tried to keep a sense of morals and values.
she also goes on simpcast w  chrissy mayr.the communities are big but overlap  so like a spiderweb we are all connected whether its lightly or more. its a great fellowship
Christianity is a scam however being a genuine person doesnt necessarily come from religion it comes from using your mind and thinking a lot more deeper than most.
@senseofreality  that part is true  but would you say the same if she s jewish  daoist  shinto  buddhist  if one considers it as a religion   muslim  etc.
@senseofreality  Christianity is not a scam the church is....and no they are not the same thing whatsoever
lol @  more deeper
@patrick henry  dont forget its about  thinking  lol
@nimmha  clearly all that matters to you doesnt and by far the world will still function without you.
@senseofreality  well see
@senseofreality  one of us is making the right bet well find out one day
@red snorlax  not happening  stop clutching to things that wont ever happen. fantasy has consumed you lot its no wonder we are living in the weakest time line mentally.
@senseofreality  no we live in a weak society because people kneel in front of flags instead of God...Godlessness is the problem here not the other way around
@red snorlax  not very smart are you  well like I said the weakest time line.
@senseofreality  I will pray for your salvation best I can do for you
@red snorlax  Im free from desire  look at my name. I cant be defeated.
@senseofreality  Im not looking for some kind of victory you can win if thats what you want lol
@senseofreality  wtf did you try to say  I wasn t writing at you
@senseofreality  wtf does this bullshit mean  .. to you doesnt and by far the world will ...
@nimmha  clearly  he has the a lot more better grip on reality than us neanderthals!
@patrick henry  you thinking these thoughts  Im not.
@nimmha  and you are
@senseofreality  I dont have a hard time believing you dont do much thinking.  you are definitely more gooder at not thinking than me for sure!
@patrick henry  are you drunk
remember when activision was just a group of developers who split off from atarI and created brilliant games like river raid and pitfall pepperidge farm remembers.
I can relate to the pixie haircut problem. it really sucks when something becomes a symbol to a  marginalized  group. you cant unironically say you like rainbows anymore because thats basically the color for lgbtq. well  you can but then you d be assumed that youre at least a gay ally when the interest can be entirely different from that movement.
normal developer interview   do you know how to write code  woke developer interview   do you have a peepee and identify as female  guess who is going to be able to develop a successful program game product... yeah  get woke go broke !oh  yeah  not buying any activision-blizzard games following this news...
Im so glad I found you channel I enjoy every thing about it your personality your love for videogames nerdiness and especially that you dont hide your faith in God keep up the great work and keep up your love for God hope you have a great day
good for them  I still haven t bought their products for years  and will continue to not do so.
as maybe one of the few who still cares about wow being saved from the fire  its disheartening to see activision blizzard focusing on something like this rather than the viability of their products. thanks for booming this one
you are smart and wise woman  we need more womans like you on youtube! God bless
not first time blizzard acts like this
Ive decided a while ago to basically be retrograde or niche when it comes to gaming. a lot of the titles I see coming out lack soul or have been partly or entirely taken over by woke doctrine  usually courtesy of sony s insane strictures  at least japan hasn t entirely caved . but the transition has paid off. Im rediscovering old titles and enjoying. you get to a point where yourealize games already peaked in the past  and youre waiting for things to get better but they never do. just gotta enjoy things for what they were.
thank you for being one of the few to actually update this!
alongside the whole population statistics thing  I cant help but wonder about how many whom aren t euro-descent heterosexual males are actually interested in entering the american gaming industry.  kinda like with youtube creators like the hacksmiths  who focus on using science to create real versions of fictional weapons and technology  like a lightsaber or a mjolnir that generates electric bolts.the hacksmiths  as well as others who do this stuff are mostly white dudes  some others are east asian dudes  including allen pan  I follow channels like this very closely for years now.  I love  em.  even as an afro-american dude  I see myself in their nerdiness  though I cant afford doing what they do.nevertheless  nothing is stopping women and people of other ethnicities who can do those things from getting into that genre of youtube except for  primarily  their own disinterest.  euro-descent males who can do these things seem to have more drive  they even make more videos per channel.I consider that even if you have separate groups of 10 people in a room  each of a different ethnicity  male groups  female groups  non-hetero groups  and ask them if they want to be in the gaming industry  the group who d have most folk saying   yup  Im genuinely interested in creating video games  would be the euro-descent heterosexual males.  if so  I d have no clue why.
cant believe how my world got flipped. I studied hard to become an animator  which I am now  studied under people from pixar  dreamworks  ilm and stuff. anyways  long story short I have a pretty kick ass reel and I have had that reel critiqued over and over by people in the industry  ilm  pixar  etc..  I have had multiple interviews with studios  especially in canada. every time itseems like it goes excellent and then I get notified I wont get the position. thankfully I had a number of people that I knew in those companies  mostly in hr. turns out  according to what they told me  I was  too white.  I was depressed and furious at the same time. I busted my ass working for years to get to my level and I was born and raised in mexico. however just because I have decent english and my skin is white now I have to beg and struggle to get a job in an industry which was my dream. apparently white skin confers me super powers beyond being born and raised in mexico. now I am watching this industry implode due to die and dont know what to think. blizzard was one of my favorite studios and a studio I wanted to work at. I am both happy and sad to watch it happen. I also started my own business which I am very thankful for  now I dont have to deal with this insanity anymore and can watch it from outside. dont get me wrong though  I am still sad  I still wanted to work in games or in film but it is what it is.
I dont see eye to eye with you on everything but I respect you more than most anyone else on this platform. be well and with unwavering faith
newsome is the reason I wont go back to california. he s made it impossible for me to run my business out of it. Imoved my business to nevada 6 years ago but because of covid I shut the doors and had my employees work from home. best move ever! they are more productive  happier  and with they money savings I was able to get all my technicians company cars  hybrids  to do service calls and even got them gas cards. I have since moved back to my home state of hawaiI with my family bringing my office manager personal assistant and her family with me. but upon watching this I realized that I only have three women working for me  they are in management positions but all my technicians are men. and are on top of their game. go figure... oh and the thought of the day get woke... become joke.
10 46 - 11 00  melonie almost broke out her tinfoil hat  then was like  nah  I ll save that bad boy for another day.  lol
Imentioned before that I quite enjoy listening to the Bible segments of these videos despite not being religious myself...that may be because many of our laws and foundation for society is based on these fundamental core teachings...and as such  its sad to see them slowly crumbling away into insanity--both politically and culturally. Im reminded by the movie  the day after tomorrow   terrible apocalypse film imo  but this scene resonates with me  where the characters go to the library to stay warm by burning books for heat  and one of the non-religious characters finds and protects the Bible from being burned  elsa  what have you got there jeremy  a gutenberg Bible. it was in the rare books room.elsa  you think God s gonna save you jeremy  no  I dont believe in God.elsa  youre holding onto that Bible pretty tight.jeremy  Im protecting it.  glares at sam  this Bible is the first book ever printed. it represents the dawn of the age of reason. as far as Im concerned  the written word is mankind s greatest achievement. you can laugh. but if western civilization is finished  Im gonna save at least one little piece of it.
I legit gave a round of applause at 8 18 when you said both political sides are bad lol same exact thought I hate politics so much. it only divides and makes people wimpy complainers
hey melonie.I am not religious at all  but even though I dont share your faith you seem to be doing the best out of it.your verse readings and interpretations show that you are a genuinely good person who cares about others.keep ignoring the haters  Im normally much more vulgar than this  Im making an effort here   you ll do great.
here in sweden we have a huge problem that no one seems to talk about  toxic feminism.here is an example.we have a gym franchise called  nordic wellness . there are currently 298 nordic wellness gyms in the country.55 of them here in stockholm. and Ive been to at least a dozen of them. all which the majority of both the workers and site managers and regional managers happen to be women.this one gym near me is one of the largest in stockholm  and in the past 2 years has had its site manager changed at least 4 times  because most of them cant seem to do the job right.women each time. and only 1 of them seemed to do a decent job  but was overwhelmed by the place so she switched to a much smaller gym.their priorities being welcoming to everyone  more than actually managing the place proper. as in proper repairs and maintenance of machines and equipment  and making sure that people follow the rules. they dont care. its as if they were hired without proper qualifications.another example being a nice girl who was working here  was great at keeping the place tidy  and was eventually promoted to site manager on another location  but she like most of them  has little to no knowledge about weight lifting  and she even suffers from a nerve inflammation on her back  and yet doesnt do anything to adress that. sorry for the long text just 1 last one..... a friend of mine  a girl who joined the military  and her only motivation was to make it more accommodating to women. even though many people have complained that women both in physical tests for firefighters  police officers  and the military  has a lower criteria for passing their tests.this country is fucked.
another great video. keep up the amazing work!
youre a bit late to the trainwreck of scandals over the years  but welcome to the boycot club!
glad you started your own business. I was about to suggest creating your own studio  or becoming part of an indie.
@dying rose  thank you  yes I basically did that but currently solo. Imay hire more people if the business improves. its a bummer though  while Ive worked on some commercial stuff I ultimately really wanted to work on films and franchises I loved as a kid. one of the opportunities was to work on a really well known franchise. we are talking at the level of toy story httydragon. I wont mention the studio out of courtesy to them though. I understand they have to follow these insane policies and they have to keep their jobs  it just saddens me it took me so long to get this far just to have to do my own thing and to be rejected by such a dumb reason.also let me add one more thing  while there is obviously discrimination  if anyone else in the industry is trying to go in  go right ahead. dont let my experience sour your desires and your attempts. I do believe if I tried harder  pushed harder  sent more and more applications eventually I would get in. I just became disillusioned with the industry due to current social dynamics and discrimination. I dont want to belong to a place where I have to beg to get in and where my skin color is considered something to be ashamed of or as if it conferred me some advantage. I also dont think I could function in a place where I would have to hold my tongue every 5 minutes due to fears of being fired or talked down to because of my color or gender.
@throw acnt   I love thatseries  how to train your dragon. my nephew turned me on to it. but yeah  you gotta stay true to your vision. never give up. with such an oversaturated and creatively defunct industry  its time for a reformation man. the market for retro-styled games and niche is growing because of these woke policies  especially in japan . tens of thousands and maybe even millions of gamers consumers are waking up and jumping ship from the mainstream  so the momentum and demand is there. hopefully we see a new era blossom in gaming and movie-making where we can fully detach from these woke greedy corporations that like to preach against the consumer at the consumer s expense. its insane! but I wish you the best of luck on your journey. hope all works out!
you should have stopped at canada   also this might be to blame for a law would you believe  this used to only apply to certain goverment positions and jobs and universities but I guess they expanded it outwardas part of the civil rights movement in 1968 under one lyndon johnson  who was sponsored by a member of goldman and sachs would you believe  the goverment put a clause in that anyone who hires anyone of a minority gets a tax rebate. giving legtimacy to the statement that you were literally only hired because of your skin color  evidently with trump gone and them running everything nowthey expanded it outwards  also theirs a certain granny glassed old woman who used this to get a job at harvard by saying she was part indian by 3   when the only relations she had to them was that her grandfather fought them back in the 1860 s  and yet she was never fired or fined for it under the heading thatshe lied on her resume  nor did the school get any blowback for it because she apparently proved it was 0.03 percent  not 3  which for some damn reason still counts despite how ludicris it all sounds  like she lied and got away with it. like its all political  I feel  not I think  hence why the only time I ever voted blue was to keep a worse blue person from getting the nomination  only to have him turn over the nomination to her anywaysand even then  Jesus that guy was a shyster  he took 13 million of the donated college kids money and bought a mansion in vermont with it  nevermind returning or making a fund to help bail kids out of college debtnope  Im moving on up to the east side with y all suckers money  like why do people vote blue againoh yeah its because their stupid lol
the british military just remove the 2 mile run to pass basic training because... some people cant run 2 miles.
@n7 tigger  wtf
@n7 tigger  so if the enemy can run farther than 2 miles they re fucked.
and  with such a woke army  sweden wants to join nato  which would 90  sure cause russia to invade  check the videos comparing the chinese  russian and us army recruitment videos. the russian one is badass. on the other hand  after a russian invasion all that woke nonsense wourd be dumped in the traybin  because its precisely the lack of real danger what allows the military to become soft  so it might indeed be good in the long run if sweden joins nato...
@jose pineda  fun fact  russia is looking for recruits through job-apps right now....
I cant speak to the activision side of things but Ive had many friends over the years  including one currently  that have worked for blizzard.  used to play dungeons and dragons in the library of their hq  even.  I never got the progressive activism feel from the company but its also felt like the business side of things was secondary to the games.  the people working there are all nerds.  they re socially awkward  smart  opinionated  and they really care about the games they create.  its like they re being forced into the political and cultural stuff and I think its been holding them back.  there are already a lot of women working with them.  its not like they go out of their way not to hire them.  more likely its the lack of women in the industry as a whole.  certainly doesnt help with the sexual assault stuff they ve had to deal with  but  again  I think the fact that it went on for so long was because the people there really just didn t know how to deal with it.  not excusing it  and the games have actually been improving since those douchebags were cut.  they were the type that refuse to make sweeping changes that wow has needed.  Im really worried about things becoming more and more corporate in the future  and less about the games.  also  sylvanas did nothing wrong and I demand a retrial.
activision blizzard creating a diversity   inclusion department does not bode well for the future of their games  what really seems needed is protection from harassment for employees.  yuck!  politicians involved in gaming is a horrible thought  perhaps thats why legislation to regulate micro transactions has stalled Im going to church for the first time since before the lockdowns  thank you for the inspiration!
I needed this verse of the day because Ive been going through a bad break up and its a long story but I saw my ex and my ex bf and seeing them made me feel defeated and sad but then youremind me that God is always with us and Ive been doing good by going to the gym hanging out with family and friends and also been serving at my church God is good
like to point out jason schrier covered up the activision accusations  he could ve reported it years ago and chose not too
hey melonie. love the Bible verse segment at end of each video. also  you should check out eric july  he s in texas too  and creating some sort of alternate non woke comic company.
dont focus on what they say but focus on what they do. -razorfist
may your day continue to be blessed  melonie.
melonie mac go boom.   activision blizzard soon to go bust.
thank you for being an example that us Christians aren t meant to be bland and lukewarm. God speed mel.
hiring 50  has to be like  some who clean the offices  some who clean keyboards.. some who answer phones.. I guess it doesnt mean they develop or have any input on gaming..  oh you work for blizzard  what do you do    um.. I push the up button in the elevator
I dont know whether jason shreier is ashamed of himself for sitting on this story in exchange for access  or if he s creaming his pants for all of the stories that he s now able to write.
honestly if I was in office the first thing to go would be affirmative action. in its place I d put for a mentorship type bursary program. companies have a pool of money from the state and federal government that can be used to mentor and recruit people that truly care about the job they want to go into. but as soon as the ones being mentored bring any type of negative impact that goes against company policy they lose their spot in the program
good to see acti-blizz doesnt feel like they ve ruined the company enough over the years.
thanks melonie  you are the best!
now I see why they re called  activision .
...talk about games that Im not particularly that into...   no problem!  thats why they have a team of writers!  like suzy  flash mob  filing cabinet and tape dispenser!  just read the teleprompter!  you know... like froskurine!
how about using totally a blind recruitment process where all you see is the applicants qualifications
this is a very bad move activision blizzard. its like that you want to fail!
lara wasn t mentioned once! youre slipping melonie!
nothing activision is doing makes sense. they just  converted  vicarious visions into a blizzard only studio. just...I dont get it.  and side note  Imay not be a Christian like you  but I completely respect what you bring to your videos and keep ya in my thoughts  if that counts for anything.
well they are only increasing the number by 50  so if you have 10 now add 5 more and youre good. I am however against diversity hires and prefer merit based systems.
hiring people based on gender  colour  orientation instead of experience and genuine interest in the product is a recipe for disaster.they will chase away the original audience while attracting no new audience  causing your business to crash  burn and fail. please let actiblizz  make this monumental mis-step.
I wonder what japan thinks of these companies.
its a souless pr stun   however they start to fire many incompetent game developers who only did their job focus on how to  force  addicted customer to play more instead of fixing the system to make game fun to play
actI bliz right now is nothing more than damaged goods  there is no saving the brand at this point. the best we can hope for is for the staff to up and quit the company  then they can go and make the games they ve always wanted.  granted funding might be an issue but there are ways to get projects funded these days.
sometimes when I woke up I just notice how this world is reversed. we live in 21 century for two decades and with every passing year it just get weirder like staying in the middle of house of mirror it doesnt feel right we have reverse racism and people say its good we threat someone not based on their skills but what they do in their bedrooms.  Im  catholic and people tell me to be ashamed what some priests do to kids or how they use elderly or week minded  it is not what my faith is about. my world view may be different Im from poland close to ukrainian border and right now  I notice how life is fragile you can lose everything in a split of a second. but faith help you keep going keeps us sane  comfort us in times of need  I ll keep you in my prayers melonie  and will leave you with one of my favourite quotes.4 even though I walk    through the darkest valley  a I will fear no evil     for you are with me your rod and your staff     they comfort me.
as a man of faith  though not Christian  I have to applaud and agree with your point about not being a pushover.
no one should be fired or turned away due to identity. and no one should be hired due to identity either. as of right now  the former is a significantly larger issue.
what s funny is that they did that here in northern commiefornia where I live. car insurance company I was at they had 75  black mostly brown hospanics and I was 1 of 3 arabs. only 1 white guy. he would call himself the token white guy and we all joke about it but the 4 of us never voice our disdain for the woke left etc. or how racist it is that he s the only white guy etc. so insane to us how racism is back and encouraged.
okay everyone  place your bets  at what timestamp will tomb raider be mentioned first     my bet is 4 46. also  no cheating.
activision blizzard is done... I dont see them surviving this... they cantry  but its already over for them...
Imiss the days when people were hired on their skills or their talents  making them suitable for the job in question.melonie hit the nail on the head  knowing you are a diversity hire must destroy that persons self-esteem.
people hired for checkboxes are probably going to write woke games.
16 43 breaking news everyone!  its been confirmed melonie mac watches rule 34!
listening to youread that Bible verse was very soothing
by their fruit  you shall know them.
blizzard has been getting more and more woke for years. the quality of their games has been getting worse and worse as well. could there be a correlation  nah  Im sure its just a coincidence.
we got her 11 02. she cursed. gotta say something somthing fake Christian or fake God fearing woman or something long those lines. God bless you girl. keep up the good work. I dont hold blizzard to the fire like these crazy people do. if they release a good game with diablo 4. I will forget this stuff even happened. granted something a few people did in a 1000  employee company.
cant they just hire the most qualified.
start another channel where you do talk about such things   conspiracies  and what not like coast to coast am  and other related topics and from a Christians point of view  I d listen for sure.
melonie you should check out the show banshee.
nah it worked great for the ghostbusters remake!
I agree. I came to echo something similar
ask disney.
okay  I finished the video and here s the spoilers for the results ...............................tomb raider wasn t mentioned once. what re the odds of that !  0
@sygos  must be some kind of mistake..
I said  ish  not a curse lol
God loves us  we love God  God wants us to love each other!love   prayers to you melonie mac!
hImelonie! as a Christian and a gamer  do you think we ll have video games in heaven   do you want any video games in heaven  super curious about this question
these people confuse expectations of workmanship when applying for jobs with opression.
imagine getting hired just because of your gender. talk about tokenism. I would be offended if I was hired just to meet a quota and not because I was the best fit for the job.
I just want a good game
youre amazing!
all I want is great games. hire the most qualified male or female
great video
as eric july would say  its time to let blizzard die and build up newer  better studios to make the same sorts of science fiction and fantasy video game mythologist moving forward. any company willing to get d.i.e. staff onboard is setting themselves up to do just that-- and thats totally fine by me.  there is plenty of other talent out there  tapped or not  waiting to be embraced.  we ll always have their great games  regardless   warcraft iI iiI  starcraft and its sequel  the first two diablo games.  enjoy those and let this company continue to dig its own grave.
I will be highly disappointed and upset that I only got hired because Im black and not for my talent and what I can offer for the company.
I think elon musk might not do the impact he wanted by colonizing mars but instead by saving culture. what s he s doing with twitter is great  and would be even greater if he made his own entertainment business too comics  tv  videogames  news media  movies  education  so humanity is prepared to make mars great.
thats a very loaded headline  so if there s 2 women nonbinary total atm  hiring 1 more hits the quota.  its just a  feel good  headline.
pixie cut girls literally anything
not only is hiring  diversity  equity and inclusion  officers a waste of money  it also supports the university die pipeline.
mel rocking that classic lc top.and now she s gonna use this comment as a segue. youre welcome
technically they want to increase the numbers  by  50 . that means that if they have 500 men and 10 women  they want to hire 5 more women. and if they have 2 non-binary people  they would hire one more.if they are grouping women and non-binary people together for that 50  increase  then they could hire them all as men who identify as women and just remove women from the workforce entirely.I work for a tech company that recently committed to having a 50 50 workforce of men and women. yet  every single cv I get for new jobs comes from men. I would happily hire any woman who can do the job. but the tech industry and tech education  college degrees  are mostly men  so where are all these women going to come from and what will happen to all the men that get pushed out for being over the gender quota I think its likely that many of the women will be hired in supporting roles such as in administration  hr  finance  marketing  cleaners  kitchen staff  reception  etc.
a huge part of these women trying to get into gaming  is trying to get a paycheck. the new women streamers you see are the ones saying its hard to get into gaming as you have better looking women  so they cant be twitch streaming partners so they know its not easy though they want that pay check  so the market is super saturated. now you get on this hiatus about including diversity employees and then in your games  it becomes people who dont care about the game and giving the customer  us actual gamers  terrible stories we dont want force fed to us. the gaming community has already seen and knows how down hill games have gone. games cant keep us intertwined in an actual story. and we beat days within days now  they dont even last a week hardly any more. so now were gonna be force fed these political stances in our games  our hobbies  these are our ways  us who are introverts and those of us who use games to hang out and make friends and escape to a fun life story. so this is all just a bunk idea

might be a bad mac boomer watcher  but is she going full tomb raider with them outfits now
I kinda get it  the industry has a history of men typically being more interested. thats just the historical trend thats been changing as women give it a chance. so naturally thats changing over time  which is fantastic and nothing but good news. however  what these companies like blizzard and nd are doing...its not organic diversification of their employees. its forced. forced fosters resentment and customers are repelled. just look at whats happened to warcrafts player base. many have left  more in-organic diversity pushes have further destroyed the product.
lets just hire women non binaries because thats what video games are about. not because of skill set  not because of desire  not because of portfolio  but because they are women something other than white men. the quality of your videogames will suffer because of this mindset. do you want good games made by skilled humans  or do you want joe non-whitey non binary woman making them. I assume this is already happening  and is just picking up more speed. look at bf2042. upwards of 300 people worked on this for 3 years  and look what you got. is this mindset already affecting your games
its getting weird not about gaming anymore
my personal annoyance with the identity politic  is that I feel like a creep for watching your content. Im in my 40 s  I live in eu  and I got no creepy  intentions... but I find you very.. ehm... pleasent to look at  -  but I watch because I like to hear your opinions... sure  I agree with most of them  but far from always... and I ll admit Im more often than not  one of those thatskip your  verse  segment.Ive struggled with pinpointing why I felt uncomftable watching your videos at time  but during this video it hit me.honestly  I dont know if its the intention  but I would be surprised if Im the only  straight gamer guy  who got a sense of  wrong  when watching very good looking gamer girls  because its become a constant attackvector from the woke crowd. but even if it isn t intentional  its fairly functional... since the majority of the gaming nerd culture is  straight males   but constantly bashing it into them that finding a women with shared interests attractive is  wrong   they make it harder for decent human beings    that are straight males  to follow the content creators that breaks their narrative.
I cant wait for you to say this is no longer a new channel
it is not only the dfeh  ca  it is also the eeoc which are the feds.  both are after the same thing.  eeoc has settled.  dfeh on the other hand does not believe the settlement goes far enough.  also the dfeh has done a number of things that is not by the book like hiring ex-eeoc employees thatshould not be working on this case.  if you want more details see hoeg law channel.  he has a playlist of 54 videos on just this.  so I dont think this move with the governor is about getting rid of the lawsuit.  I think it is to conclude the lawsuit with the eeoc settlement.  note that microsoft has something to gain for the speedy conclusion as well.
may I suggest psalm 22 for friday
if they start injecting politics into my video games  Godsakes I ll be so done already.
blizzard is hiring a diversity officer while new discoverywarner just fired their diversity officer.  I dont know if discoverywarner is planning on hiring another one  but maybe some of these companies are learning their lessons on wokeness   hire good people  make good content.
itsays the meek shall inherit the world  unfortunately the word meek has been changed over time. but the original meaning is  strength under control
as someone who has played wow since it came out I cantell you it is hot garbage thanks to these people. the main blizzard team left years ago  there is nothing left but these people. yet another franchise infiltrated and ruined. go boom!
the wording of the statement is interesting. if there is only 10 women and nonbinary in employment  they will hire 5 more. if the overall employee pool is 100  then 5 more isn t going to change much.
wow someone with some common sense.also  how dare you  call me a boomer
diversity hires and affirmative action always has a negative effect. if a company has a policy to hire based on personal traits rather than merit  it hurts productivity and the company loses money. people will ask what happened before productivity dropped and they will find that the company hired more of a particular type of person and they will draw the conclusion that the type of person is bad for business.but what will probably happen is they will hire qualified game designers and writers regardless of gender  but then fill the quota of  female employees  by creating jobs out of nowhere like a diversity  inclusivity  and equity department in which the employees will do little to improve productivity or the games. either way  the company will lose money and get a bad reputation because of their virtue signaling.similar thing happens in schools. affirmative action requires a school to accept more black people and more of those people will drop out because they didn t qualify for the school in the first place  and the school looks like it is a bad school for black people to go to because of the high dropout rate. or  if the school goes so far as to grade based on skin color  the black students will graduate and perform worse at their jobs than the other students which will make all black workers look bad.empty virtue signaling which will have the opposite effect they think it will.
I only want talented people in the industry I dont care if they are men or women
to be fair  you were hired because you are a cute girl. its kind of different for a tv host. being a cute girl will attract more viewers  especially on a gaming or sports show. you could make the argument that that made you more qualified for the position than a male with more knowledge. I dont think you were really a diversity hire.
there s a reason no one like last of us part 2 and majority overwhelmingly loved the first game.  I say let them go broke.  I stick to non woke indie developers and never preorder until I see reviews from people I trust.
by any chance you have the lara replica pistols
I think a lot of people feel the same way you do about diversity hire. it creates a doubt thatsomeone is good enough for his position. and lets say he is a part of some  diverse  group and would have gotten the position on his own merit regardless  people around him will not see his merit because they also know he was a diversity hire. also I dont think the woke view these things as we do. they feel they are entitled to those positions because it is the  system  that holds them back  not themselves. so we have white liberal white knights who must provide to the minority groups because these white liberals dont think they can do anything on their own.
read about this today melonie.  I think what youre seeing from this story is to me   gavin really meddled here.  I think he really did it.  reason   simple.  while microsoft might wind up owning the company when all is said and done gavin doesnt want his own state government offices and officials to let the hammer fall down too hard on activision blizzard and thats because if they do   he doesnt want them to wind up leaving california and moving their company s hq to another state like texas or florida because the state government was too hard on activision blizzard legally  possibly forcing their hand to leave.  gavin has already lost oracle  hp and tesla  plus about 30 more companies  to his own policies he enforces in his state.  he cannot afford to lose activision blizzard after all that.  the optics and image would look terrible on him personally and hurt his societal rep.  of course thats just my opinion  I could be wrong.  out!
as a straight  white male I am genuinely anxious about becoming a diversity hire in the future.
yes they want us  straight males  ashamed of our sexuality. dont go along with it. ofc be respectful to women  dont be a creep  dont harass or make advancements when its clearly not wanted. but do not start thinking you are doing something wrong for liking to look at pretty women. people being attracted to other people is the foundation for the existence of the human race. and straight sexuality is the only one that creates more of the species. so it is sick that that is the one sexual preference that is targeted by todays western sjw s.finding a woman good looking is not disrespecting her or diminish her. treat everyone with the respect they deserve. and if you find some of them attractive that is perfectly fine.
already are.
yeah china.
retro or niche is the way forward.
except tlou part iI was the fastest selling ps4 game lol
@underthegun897  because they lied to people. sales dropped off quickly though.
we all know by law these company s have to hire a certain number of diversity  but the community doesnt care what your background of sexual orientation or how you define yourself.you take care of the community and what they want  the community will take care of the company. the real community  not these political bait clickers
well wait 50  of what  the current number ovf those types or the 50  of their total staff  that context matters
its not enough to be passive about  current bad thing that Imade up to justify my existence and purpose   you must be actively anti- current bad thing that Imade up to justify my existence and purpose .  this is the verbatim language of woke cultists. this deI officer is an obvious grift as the percentages they demand are mathematically unattainable  or at least pragmatically unattainable  which permanently justifies their existence and purpose. when your purpose is self-perpetuation  then your purpose is fake.
they are looking for over representation
a common Christian misconception. when Christ said to turn the other cheek  he didn t mean to let someone continuously beat us. he meant it as to make that person see us as they re equal people. the reason is because back in the day when you get slapped you get slapped with a back hand by a slave master  if you turn the other cheek they have to slap you with the palm of their hand  which is a sign that you are an equal. so Christ was telling people that if someone strikes you to turn the other cheeks so that they strike you as equal not as a lesser. too many times Christians think that we re supposed to be subservient and not strike back or defend ourselves because of that quote. they lack the context of the times.
I was secular for my whole life growing up in a very left wing city in canada with a secular family  going to public school and watching liberal tv. but I became a Christian in 2020 because of all the crazy stuff happening in the world  and the fact that it was mainly the Christians who were standing up for everyone s freedoms and liberty--including the brave pastor artur who has been arrested and held in jail multiple time by the government on bogus charges. it was purely my own ignorance and arrogance that made me live for 35 years rejecting Christ  and I see now how satan loves secularism because it makes so many people completely ignorant to his corrosive influence over their lives. 2020 gave me 20 20 vision  and I just wanted to tell you that as a newcomer to Christ  I absolutely love your verses of the day. the Bible is huge  and these verses help to make me focus my attention on specific areas to consider. its difficult to find churches in my town that aren t full of new age rainbow stuff  so thank you for bringing your Christian perspectives to your channel  its like a cherry on top of your already awesome video game coverage!
blizzard just shot themselves in the foot and now the head
Im not a fan of forced diversity hiring. I wasn t diversity sampling you. I was checking for friend and possible girlfriend material. my bad  if unwanted. I ll ease off the throttle and hold friend professional if thats the case. its all good.
nice lara croft get-up.
great stream today sister  . yaway  not God.
melonie will the games survive after the woke takeover
they re a dead company to me at this point. Im just commenting for the algorithm
they need to get the women out and replace them with bowls of fruit
but conspiracy territory is my favorite
so more cleaners then
raise ur hand if you think they re just hiring women so there s more female employees for kotick to abuse
blizzard is dead and they are tanking themselves even more
father God pls clean out the game industry   america as a whole! in Jesus mighty name
I quit wow less than 2 months after last xpac. I just dont care about them anymore
I just installed all games through blizzard slash activision and uninstalled blizzards launcher no thank you!
thanks for clearing that up  I didn t know that was what that meant.
I wont ever play a game made by activision blizzard  they ruined there reputation to much for that.
you look like lara croft...wait a minute you are lara croft. it permeates all over you. most intreresting.
more games that dont appeal to me incoming.
beautiful orange woman returns  p

you said something about you being a check list hire. just because your a woman and not based on your knowledge. that to add to that then Im you being attractive helped.
I want to go keto  but I have anxiety issues and Im too scared to start. if anyone here has any advice or words of encouragement  it would be most appreciated.
its not so much  most qualified for the job  as it is mostly just men make up the majority interested in the field of game design dev. went to college for game development and across the entire program there was literally 3 women. 99   men interested in gamedev  not really many women.digital art in general though has plenty of women and they do get full representation  for their work  as anyone should. game studios hire general artists too so youre likely to find women  by merit of their work  in game studios too.trying to  civil engineer  results of genders and race just makes boundaries and causes real discrimination where there was likely none before
she s getting involved in the stories too  to make them more diverse from different viewpoints.  which sounds fine on paper  Im all for more diverse viewpoints  but the more  diverse  and  inclusive  entertainment has gotten the worse the writing has become.
cool.   love you
this is a bad idea. I also think its to help with union busting. the workers want a union. Im sure actiblizz does not. not to mention  if youre hiring based upon a demographic  then your product will suck.
someone watches hoeglaw
as a  person of color  I hate that word with a passion! just call me slur at this point  would be less the demeaning. lol
if they want more woman in video game industry they need woman to have more interest in gaming when they are younger so can study it when they are older. seems to be more men using escapism from games then woman. which isn t really a good thing
literally nobody cares about the programmers  coders  devs  artists and play testers skin color! ! !... we are gamers  all we want is good games!
this counts as a comment
hI  mel!! its me!!
good games or diversity ... pick one.
world of wokecraft
melonie.. with all due respect.. could you please get a pop filter  or try not to speak directly into the microphone  I can quote rags in saying that your audio is key.. and you do have a tendency to have hard p s  t s  hard c s and k s.if you want a bit of cash for it  then just say so  I d just like to listen to you complain  but you do need a pop filter.
yip. programming and design isn t something where race and sex and shit matters. its just the skills in making the games
why dont they just stop sexually harassing women in the workplace  you could enforce it with like you know a hr department !
I dont know what a woman is anymore actually. they will just hire guys thatsay they are woman.
diversity quota is the dumbest thing Ive ever heard of...
weird the diversity people dont want more woman in crappy physical jobs mostly men do. idk y this matters. idc who is behind the screen making the game. its the product that matters. I understand it for things like healthcare etc u just dont want all one type of people
hiring women is great as long as they re the well qualified for the job  but if they re doing it just to meet some quota or have more estrogen in the room ...screw that. you d think the lesson would have been learned with kamala harris.
truth hurts !!! ... the moment you start talking about truth  in a ...  democratic  country  like usa  thats the moment your f.b.i. agent chokes  spilling his coffee
lets just point out you never see this kind of thing when it comes to a job like garbage men  construction workers  septic tank cleaners  ect.  99.99  of eletrical linemen are male  make excellent money  ect.  you dont see women clamoring for these jobs.
activisions corruption will not  disappear  try fixing the games instead of pandering!!
hiring based on skin color and gender is illegal
to last segment. Im not Christian by definition and I dont think good ideal to dogmatize God or any abstract super species. I want say I dont know and thats it. I rather tell the truth than say God know or anything like that. otherwise  I had been called catholic.
you know  even if straight men dominate the industry  why should that matter when making games  straight men made almost all the games from our past we love and they are played still by women  gays  and people with disabilities. one of my favorite video games of all time  metroid prime  was made by japanese men and featured a female lead when I am a white man. this all feels very small minded
ah yes. I d love to go work for a company recently caught in a lawsuit following a 2 year investigation that uncovered gender discrimination against women in both pay and workload  and blatent sexual assault. sign me up.
first!
instead of worrying about pleasing the minority with diversity hires  how about making decent games  instead.
hey activision blizzard  the corporate woke fad came and left 7 years ago. there s easier ways to send yourself bankrupt.
what do I win melonie !  d
hooray!!!
