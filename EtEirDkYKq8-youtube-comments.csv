but johnny depp gets instantly fired for a false accusation. stop it  warner bros.
this is the best possible news this movie could get at this point.
the fact that this decision took so long to make is wild.
man. what happened to this dude  like  what drives someone to be like this  its sad  really. what a waste of many great opportunities that put him where he is. I would love to have the opportunities he was awarded. I would be the most gracious person.
your take on calling him by his name is really good and yeah takes away from his crimes if you try to cater to his weirdness
ezra needs jail time
the fact that this went on this long is unreal. the man was basically reverse flash and wb dc just straight up allowed it lol it was me barry. I fucked my career at super speed and the studio sat on their thumbs!
crazy that you can ruin a normal person s career over a single false accusation but multiple evidence-backed accusations of severely awful things still weren t enough to get miller cancelled within the normal timeframe.
excellent vod  mel! I hope he does end up being arrested and sentenced for 26 years. he did a lot of horrible things. its absolutely pathetic that wb kept him for as long as they did. Im sorry that you have to keep dealing with all of these wokies attacking you all day nearly every day  you dont deserve it. they are vile. you are a wonderful lovable woman and you deserve far better. gives big strong hug
miller is out  cavill is back. the world is healing.
I agree that  forcing religion  is bad witness. according to some anti-theists  though  everything from praying in public to being spotted holding a Bible is considered  force .
another awesome video melonie. what matters is that ezra is going  around hurting women. doesnt matter what his orientation is  he needs to go to jail.
finally we get some justice!! just because you were a justice league member didn t mean you were above the law
Ive enjoyed watching your videos from the moment I came across your channel - and the world sure needs more people like you  whether they admit that or not  to speak up for what needs to be said.to take a direct quote from a former member of what is now a former channel  that got acquired  that used to to do top tens  you know youre on the right track if youre facing alot of direct opposition.keep doing what youre doing  melonie mac! go boom!!!
I respect you for referring to him by his biological gender  its a bold thing to do in this day and age.
hey melonie great new video. batman and superman are my favorite comic book characters. if ezra miller is in the flash movie  Im not going to watch it. still hoping black adam is good. and to quote the quartering  go woke  go broke.  always good to see you melonie. I love to hear your takes  even if I dont 100  agree with all of them  Imean a agree probably 99    all the time. until next time. go boom.
great breakdown  again. and thank you for standing up for your faith  morals  and the Lord!  not many doing that in this realm.
I had seen you on nerdrotic fnt and thought I d give your channel a try. your entire video was brilliant but your segment on your faith got me to subscribe. well done and Im excited to catch your future work and rewatch the backlog
you go  melonie! God bless!
I really would like to see scott eastwood play barry and james marsden play eobard.. just kinda looks like what Ive always wanted the big screen versions to look like
white man vs they them
@rs zab  ezra is a white man too
@strange faced  ezra is lgbtq . he thought he could be a shit and no one would say a word about it.
he didn t have alphabet privilege.
@strange faced  Im gay but I ll be damned if the general behavior of that community gave me the greatest amount of hesitation in coming out a few years back. bunch of narcissistic psychos are given way too much cover and are pandered too willingly by the establishment.
@chrisbg99  add celebrity privilege and they might as well have diplomatic immunity
@strange faced  johnny depp is straight though  and thats a strike against him.
minority privilege. if you have some sort of minority points  woman  poc  lgbtqiaap   etc...  you can get away with a lot. if you have zero minority points you will get cashiered for minor offenses.
nice  username toganium.toga is my favorite mha villain.
they aren t saying they are replacing him in that movie  just that he wont be  back  post this movie.   if he s still in this movie its done for.
imagine how terrible batgirl was that it got axed before the flash starring confirmed groomer and almost certainly child predator ezra miller.
@ryan  actually  batgirl was cancelled because of a tax write off. had nothing to do with quality since poorly made movies are released all the time.
@toganium  the decision to cancel it and write it off was made after test audiences responded poorly to it. they had no confidence in the product.
he was never right for the role. I grew up reading the flash in the 70 s - he was my favorite hero back then. ezra miller portrays none of the qualities  or looks  for that matter  of barry allen.
@mark taylor  the spiderman rip off attitude  the cringy way he ran  the blue lighting  the crappy ass costume. nothing flash at all.
@josu  patI o  indeed
this has been the decision for a long time once he went absolutely crazy. the movie was already filmed at that point.
@geoffrobinson  that is inaccurate. they  wb   dc  stated in an article not even a month ago they had no plans to recast or replace ezra and would be in the sequel film and any other dceu properties. they only backed down from thatstance now with these new  worse accusations and charges.
@alexander angelus
ezra  was accused  with false accusations too.the whole  pedophile  shit was debunked  but people keep repeating it again and again.
yep because the accusations was against a woman working for wb   ezra miller s victims were just ordinary people sounds wrong but thats how movie studios look at things   actors are seen as superior to us ordinary folk
@chrisbg99  I was so pissed when I knew he got away with all what he did. at least justice arrived at last  late but it arrived.
@twilightmysts  you just sound jaded and salty towards those demographics
was watching justice league today   ezra miller is a great actor he needs to stay .
so you want to punish ezra miller for what happened to johnny depp   because they were unfair to johnny depp you want them to be unfair to miller too   does that make sense
@strange faced  check again
@chrisbg99  same here.
@twilightmysts  this is your average mindest of a 2020 twitter user.
yes! youre right!
@josu  patI o  actually the justice league  snyder cut  arrived first  then actual justice afterwards
I say watch the movie let the fandom  story  effects  and the fate after the movie. new face for flash unless they could change him now    cg or reshoot flash scenes with ezra out with different guy but the story can do it and erase his face with one  you like   we ll see how it winds up  hopefully in the new dcu.
@twilightmysts  true
@alexander angelus  ooooh I hope this starts getting used more often
he probably had problems his whole life that he hid so he could function in society  then his career blew up and he got enough of an ego to think he could get away with doing whatever he wanted.
evil  demon s   deals with the devil   mental issues you name it
he was a child actor running around hollywood doing seedy things with adults. of course he was going to end up like this.
drugs and social media
california does this to people...  california!
he was always like that he just got caught but him being a part of the alphabet clut gets you certain privileges. you can kidnap  abuse and choke women and you cant say anything.
Im old school so I go with biology youre born male or female so when you become an adult if you want to change your sex well thats your business and whoever you chooses as your life partner is your business but if you want respect you need to give others respect.
he s not over.
jail time and some serious psycological help.
ezra needs a locked ward asylum. but prison is a good second choice.
he deserves jail time.
and electro-shock therapy
@james mac777  except that most of the stories about him are untrue.
yeah. lotsa jail time. not gonna happen  though. rich hollyweirdos always walk.
@nexus169  and by the way  the woman above is telling lies about ezra.  there is no evidence that he groomed anyone  the girl says he didn t  and he kidnapped no one.  no I do not  believe all women .  if a man told a lie like about a woman like the lie this videomaker is telling about ezra the world would never hear the end of it.  and she has the nerve to call herself a Christian.
@fried chicken  lie all the time  do you   he never kidnapped anyone! and the woman he supposedly  choked    his hands were on her collars  not her throat.  of course he should not have touched her at all  but he did not choke her.
@marco genovesi  it wasn t hollywood.  right after he got hired to play flash  he hired a native american  spiritual advisor  or medicine man.  it was right after that that he dumped his long time love erin urb  she said the medicine man told ezra thatshe was a parasite  and started putting up very self degrading cross dressing pictures of himself all over the internet  doing self degrading things on interviews  etc  putting up very vulgar videos of himself  deliberately messing up his music  wearing very ugly makeup  I think it may have something to do with  letting go of the ego  as I have heard is done in some indian religions  and just degrading himself in general.  he was already booked for the flash and fantastic beasts  but got no other acting jobs except one  a small part playing the young salvador dalI  outside of wb.  since he started letting the medicine man run his life  his life and career have taken a steady downhill slide.  its like he turned his life over to the devil.   next will be his life.
every person is a different world him herselfwe cant just ask  what made someone like him to do these criminal things  because we dont know how he really is!we just saw some of his work  not the real human..Im not condemning him  just hope he was like mad because drugz  so he could get clean and be able to keep working  very difficult after all this ruckus
@d  he didn t move her by her neck.  his hands were on her collars  not her throat.  I am not really defending him on this.  he had no business touching her  period.
@jenny clark  on her neck.
@jenny clark  why are you defending that piece of crap  he was grooming a teenager  had some kind of cult  and is accused of assaulting a bunch of people. are you saying that all of that is a lie  he deserves prison.
@cristela  there is no evidence that he groomed her or anyone!! where is your evidence    I doubt that he had a cult but even if he did that is not against the law.  the  assault  cases were dealt with at the time.
@d  take a second look.
@marco genovesi  no but when he first got the medicine man  that was when he started doing all the self degrading things all over the internet.  I think he may have been  advised  to do things that would bring down his  overblown  ego.
@jenny clark  it looks like a normal mental breakdown to me  he reached a snapping point and then started behaving erratically   abusing drugs and people to vent his anger and confusion. nobody cantake this  medicine man  s statements seriously unless they are already weakened and broken. so yeah cool this conman didn t help him one bit but he is not the cause for his situation either. ezra was going to explode like this  it was only a matter of time
@marco genovesi  yes but something very radical happened to him years ago right after he met this medicine man.  he went from a well spoken  grateful  rising star to a complete idiot almost over night.  that was back about 2014.  he didn t just have a breakdown now.
@jenny clark  I dont remember the exact dates but thats the point he had the breakdown Im talking about. most people dont recover from that without assistence. without assistence they usually go into self-destruction spiral  where they keep destroying themselves more and more and more  until either they manage to suicide or drugs kill them
@misterlau  while I whole-heartedly agree that we are all unique individuals  there are some broad-stroke categories we can apply  its a spectrum! lol . I said above that he is a narcissist  and since he got a little bit of power  he became a dangerous one.
@marco genovesi  what makes you think he had a breakdown in 2014   he had every reason to be happy then.  he had just received two awards for his acting and had just been hired by warner bros.  why would he have a breakdown
@mark taylor  ok  of course but its too bad he went basically nuts...something is wrong with this human being  and its not helpful for him and his family I presume  to know all the shit added by some people  since obviously they already have a 40 ton container of it above them.
drugs  stress  alcohol  social media and obsession with genders or sex are common triggers
having horrible irresponsible parents
is everyone daft  he clearly has severe mental illness.
@gregory szatmari  from years of abuse
@mark taylor  agreed.yes  its unlikely that people get to these extremes.and honestly  I just wanted to watch a the flash   movie  not  law and order
@mark taylor  eeehhh.... unnecessary graphic violence
same type that wants attention wants to be an actor. bunch of pretenders  the better they are  the more of a sociopath they are.
@dahken  he started out as a child actor. that comes with a world of problems on its own just being exposed to hollywood degeneracy at such a young age. Imean just look at people like demI lovato or bella thorne.  both cray cray.
@jenny clark  ezra started out as part of the alphabet people. said he was bisexual at a very young age.  doubt the medicine man was the catalyst. just the cherry on top. edit  ezra s problem is he followed hollywood trends and no surprise it turned him into an absolute predator.
@loki-of-asgard  yup I see he is facing serious charges. I didn t see before details of his fine behavior.I didn t care much because reasons I wasn t watching much this guy is a dangerous very dangerous one. its very likely he is mentally very ill.
thats how they start. but then pride sneaks in. happens all the time unfortunately.
@loki-of-asgard  it wasnt the medicine man role  it was the school shooter role was the catalyst that had him go off the deep end. 0
@jubeI yagami  Im not sure thats the case.  if you look at his early interviews. he was polite  grateful for the roles he had gotten  very well spoken and well read....something radical happened to him right after he hired an indian medicine man for a  spiritual advisor .  he suddenly changed for the very worse.  dumped his long time girlfriend with whom he had been living because  she said  the spiritual advisor had convinced ezra thatshe was a  parasite .  then began putting very self demeaning  disgusting cross dressing videos all over the internet  I dont dislike them because he was cross dressing  but because they were ugly and self demeaning .  and a lot that were not cross dressing but just self degrading.  overnight it was like he was suddenly a completely different person.  downhill from there.
@shaman sage  his mother did let his two older sisters keep him dressed as a little girl when he was little.
@shaman sage  I doubt he was sexually abused.
@misterlau  going next door and taking liquor from an old friends house  something like that is not usually even prosecuted.  probably because the cops there have bought the lies being put up on the internet.
@shaman sage  you could rack up every bad thing anyone did to former  abuse .  unless you have something specific
@jenny clark  ok groomer.
@themanfromauntie  and who am I grooming    oh  thats right my cat.  Im grooming her to force her to clean up the mice.  manipulation and grooming for my own benefit.
@jenny clark  except neither these youtubers or the people commenting here care about  truth .they saw the clickbaits and ate all of it without doing a proper research.
@maskofshy  correct  thank you.  and this one claims to be a Christian.
@james mac777  he took her to england   along with a bunch of other kids to see the movie studios in england.  the parents got the passports.  how is that grooming    she was eighteen when she came to ezra s place and  is now eighteen and says that ezra never groomed her or did anything else wrong to her. of course the word of the  victim  should be completely ignored.  the fact thatshe dropped out of college is not ezra s fault.
100  certainty he will serve no jail time. dude needs actual help. he is clearly mentally ill.
@james mac777  yes they did file a complaint against him but not for taking her to england!  they got her a passport for that!  they filed a complaint after she was 18 asking for a restraining order against ezra to keep him away from their full grown daughter and to get conservatorship over her.  they got the temporary anyone can get a temporary  but when it got to court for the permanent  it was refused.  why   because she is a full grown woman and has a right to be with ezra or anyone else she wants to be with and has a right to run her own life!!  she is the  groomed  girl and says that ezra did not groom her and has done nothing wrong to her  just like the woman he supposedly  kidnapped  who says he did not kidnap her and has done nothing but good for her and her kids.
@james mac777  I did not say she was eighteen when she went to england with him.  she went to england with him with her parents consent.  there was nothing wrong or predatory about him taking her and other kids to england to tour the studios!!!  what the hell was wrong with that     your post rambles on and on.  this has nothing to do with sex.  age of consent at 16 for sex has nothing to do with this.    they had parental rights and they exercised them.  they consented for her to go to england for a tour.  again  there was nothing wrong with that.   when she left the reservation and came to ezra s place she was 18.  that is not  changing the goalpost  that is just the fact.  her parents filed a complaint when she was 18  not fifteen or underage. their request for a restraining order was refused because the was a full grown adult.    and you talk about her like she is some kind of victim.  she is not a victim.  she  says ezra has done nothing wrong to her.  get it     she is not a victim  he has done nothing wrong to her!!
he s not the hero we wanted  its the prison sentence he deserves.
@james mac777  there has been no such compliant.  there was no complaint until she was 18.  where did you get this idea   they did not put in any complaint when he took her to england to do the tours.  besides the mann act does not cover just any kind of travel.  it has to be for sexual or immoral purposes.  you cannot give permission to someone to take your kid to another country  provide the passport to the kid  then go to the cops and put in a complaint that he took your kid to another country.  grooming is not just knowing a kid or being nice to them.  it has to have some nefarious intention  like grooming them for underage sex   trying to get money from them  etc.  just being an acquaintance to a kid is not grooming.
@james mac777  as usual your post just rambles on.    there is no evidence that he  abused american indians.  he has put in years of service to try to help them.  did he make a couple of people mad   apparently.  but that does not mean he broke any law or abused them.  you said we have no batman hero.  I think you meant flash hero.in the first place  he never crossed state lines with her when she was underage except with her parent  s consent when they got the passports.  there is no evidence whatsoever that he had any sexual intention.  so no he did not break the law there.    he never kidnapped her.  she came of her own accord.  she came to him  get it   she herself dropped out of college because she was upset when her friend william died.  she can always go back if she wants to.  no  there is no law anyway against taking a full grown adult away from her family and when she comes herself it is not kidnapping.      when she came to live with ezra temporarily  she was 18  a full legal adult and she came by plane of her own wishes.  her parents came and got her  and a few weeks later she got on another plane and went back to him.  there was no kidnapping.  she is a full grown adult and neither she nor ezra have broken the law by being together.  you sound like you have been listening to sloan or shogun with the ideas you have.  they both lie a lot. there is no evidence that ezra is  grooming under age girls .  that was not said in any magazine article or anywhere.  the videomaker just made that up.  the articles did mention  young people .  that does not mean they are under age  and even if there are young people or even under age people there that does not mean he is grooming them.  I have never heard of anyone being friendly with a bank robber because they have stockholm syndrome.  for it to be stockholm syndrome  anyway  the person has to be isolated from the world and allowed to see only the people keeping them prisoner for a long time.   she has never been kept prisoner  and she is certainly not isolated.  ezra never violated the law with tokata because he did nothing of sexual nature to her when she was under 18  she has said that he didn t  and she is 18 now so if they want to have sex that is their choice.  the other things you mention are not against the law.  having no social graces is not against the law.    your posts are so rambling you sound like you may be high yourself.  are you
@james mac777  he is in the news because he is a minor celebrity who had a vicious stalker for at least the last 6 years   really longer   she called the parents of tokata and told them that he was grooming tokata  hitting her  bullying her  etc.  this stalker  she goes by the name of vintage devil but her name is ren turner  put up a video saying she is sorry she did that  that it was a lie because she just wanted to cause trouble for ezra who would never give her a tumble.  when she saw that the rumor had taken off on youtube and was ruining his life and career  she tried to stop it  but it was too late.  the parents had already spread it all over youtube and the internet and vicious uploaders like sloan and shogun had added to the original stories.    admitted  he has really done some things wrong like bar fights and stealiing his neighbors booze but the grooming  molesting childred  kidnapping stuff is pure fiction.  I am giving you a link to her confession of lying if you are broad minded enough to look at it   the actual conversation with her begins at 16 46    https   youtu.be 2lg1h5lqegu
@james mac777  did you look at the link I sent you   of  course not. you just want to believe him guilty.
@james mac777  of  course you did not follow the link because you dont want to hear the truth.  I agree with you about bad people  but before you condemn you should know the truth.  why would yourepeat the same lie     ezra did not travel to an indian reservation and kidnap an underage girl!  she came to his place by plane and she was over 18!!    do  you just like spreading lies about people      of course you wont look at the link put up by the person who admits she started this whole string of lies because you just want to condemn him  innocent or guilty!  some Christian you are!!!    whatever happened to johnny is not ezra s fault.  buy the way  do you know that he has always said that johnny was his idol   you dont have to worry about johnny he is a big star.  he will always be successful.  most people dont even know who ezra is.  his career may not survive this hate campaign.  along with the other people you listed do you think there is no place in hell for you   there is.
@garfield smith  he deserves some punishment but not 26 years.
@jenny clark  I agree.  stories dont add up.
@james mac777  mr. mac you are saying you are a Christian and you dont even want to hear all the information    well I looked at the link and saw this interview.  I had seen it before  but it does shed truth on the situation.  this woman made up the story of the grooming and called the girl s father the girl was already 18  and told him that the girl was being groomed.  she says it was not true.  why not be broad minded enough to listen to the other side  as  a Christian dont you want to be a just person    look at the link  please.
@jenny clark  thank you for your effort jennyc.   I feel so sorry for ezra miller.  no wonder he is going crazy.!!  he worked all these years for his career and now this smear campaign....and I read another of your posts where you said that he changed suddenly when he got that  spiritual advisor .  I think so too.  he may be keeping him drugged up and hypnotized  or demon possessed or something.but for these two accusations you are right there is no evidence he did that.
@pat emers  I do not know all of the charges or what the penalties are on those charges  but yes he deserves jail time if found guilty  but a lot of medical help. big issue is will he get justified time in jail being a celebrity.
@garfield smith  if you dont know what the charges are how do you even know if he is guilty or if he deserves jail time
@pat emers  I have read some of what he is accused of or charged with. but not all so I do not know how much total time he deserves. b e and theft do not add up to 26 yeras  but some time.
@garfield smith  considering that the house he  broke into   even though he went through an unlocked door  was the house of a lifelong friend  the chances are that he thought he was welcome to do that. probably an argument between friends that went bitter for some reason and the friend decided to  get him  when he had the chance.   as for what else he has been accused of...no one deserves punishment for things he has just been accused of when  in fact there is no evidence that he did it. I  m talking about the grooming and kidnapping charges.
@james mac777  I did not say that he didn t meet her.  he met her when she was 12 and knew her when she was growing up  because he worked with her father for indian rights.  but he hardly knew her he was not grooming her.  there is no evidence for that whatsoever.  he did not choose a child for a girlfriend. she has said up until just recently that their relationship was always platonic.  recently there have been reports of it becoming more romantic recently but she is well past 18 now.    you are obviously deranged. your thinking is scattered and disjointed.  and yourefused to even look at the link I sent you where the woman who started this whole mess of lies confesses thatshe started it. you are religious. but you are not rational.
@james mac777  if you want to get into heaven you d better quitspreading lies like  ezra miller kidnapped an underage girl .
@james mac777  there are plenty of complaints and accusations.  that is not the same as a fact.  the girl is 18 now and says that ezra did not groom her.  how could he  anyway   he did not live on the reservation.  he seldom saw her when she was 12 or 14.  he was away working and when he was on the reservation  he had his real girlfriends with him  and she had a closer guy friend william.  most of the year when she was 14  ezra was traveling all over the world with claudia kim.    the parents became upset when  after she turned 18 and had left the reservation  which they didn t like  his stalker  ren turner  called the parents and told them that ezra was grooming  threatening and otherwise abusing tokata.  the father then put that all over the internet.  ren turner saw that this was ruining ezra s life and regretted what she did  and put up a video admitting thatshe made it up for spite.  but it was too late  the father had already put it all over the internet  then a lot of spiteful videomakers flew with it.  tokata says she was not groomed.  the woman he was accused of kidnapping says she was not kidnapped  neither was tokata kidnapped  she got on a plane and flew to ezra.  there is no victim of kidnapping  there is no victim of grooming.  oh but of course yourefuse to look at the video where the stalker admits thatshe started this whole thing with her lies.
@james mac777  anyone can make a charge or complaint.  a charge or complaint is not evidence.  there is absolutely no evidence that ezra miller kidnapped or groomed anyone.
@james mac777  if he was grooming her since she was 12 years old  why didn t they do something about it then   why did they get her a passport so she could go with him and the other kids to england when she was 14 or 16   isn t it obvious to anyone that these people lied   he could not have groomed her since she was 12 because he was hardly ever there!  and yes  when they made the complaint  she was already 18.  they did not make any complaint when she went to england with him  and he did not kidnap her.
he needs time in arkham
@james mac777  well in the snakes  you can include all the people who post lies about him and dont care if they are ruining his life and career.
jail and a lot of ect  a whole lot of ect.
ezra needs a good lawyer and a better publicist.  he also needs to get rid of that  spiritual advisor .  that guy really messed up his head.
@jenny clark  its very odd.. I dont know  hope he...bleh whatever  I dont know what happened to this guy  just thatseems to be serious stuff
@shaman sage  where did you see a story that he was a comfort boy    its not on the internet.  where did you see or hear that
@shaman sage  yes but where did you hear this about him
you know ive been asking the same question and I am afraid of the answer... I am starting to think something like what happened to heath ledger must have happened to him because he literally played an honest to God sociopath psychopath is a movie a while back  his performance was scary and I really wonder if it messed him up to become a real sociopath. really chilling stuff...
@imjoeimjoe  no way he s over.  I am not a psychologist and I would bet that you are not either.  the issue here is not whether he is a psychopath  but whether melonie lied and she did.  there is no evidence whatsoever that ezra groomed anyone  kidnapped anyone or any of that bull.  melonie is just a liar who calls herself a Christian.
@imjoeimjoe  no.  something radical happened to ezra around 2014.  one day he was ezra  the next day he was this freak who only wanted to put up very self degrading things about himself on youtube. and Imean it literally happened overnight.  he went down hill from there.
@imjoeimjoe  hmm not really. people have other deeper issues. and ledger  I dont remember him behaving like miller.ledger was very depressed  of course! but personal stuff. he was awesome and etc.phoenix  bale and others use this techniques  but they know thats their character. everyone is very talented and...  heath ledger had issues  and its like that. we are human beings  and sometimes we just cant manage some sh t.ledger was very talented but he wasn t happy enough I guess... but its not the acting method of  being  the character.cheers
@misterlau  dude he played a psychopath in like 3 movies why do you think he did itso well
@imjoeimjoe  cause he is a good actor he obviously is not alright  those things he do  did...judging him is not my job. but if for any reason I were in his shoes  I would be 6  under s  t  wouldn t i
@misterlau  all psychopaths are good actors.
@coldspell  he has never lived in california.
@loki-of-asgard  he is in no way a predator.
@jubeI yagami  he never had a medicine man role.
@jenny clark  shaman sage likes to make up stories.
