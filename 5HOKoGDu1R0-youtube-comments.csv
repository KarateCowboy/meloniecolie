I came here to hangout and laugh because this is a crazy situation for the whole world.
I love that obama promises flexibility with russia left defends it  trump visits and says to stay in his lane and  entire right wing loves putin
as 11  year active duty military I cope with everything through dark humor and Im convinced that anyone who doesnt get it has never been through something so miserable or horrible that all you can do is laugh.  also  loved the verse of the day mel.  who knows maybe we are in the end times but in the end what can we really do about it besides sharing God s love with as many people as possible before we leave this earth and laugh at the horrible situation we re in.  bring on the ukraine russia meems!
melonie mac s arms need their own fan s page.
glad to see someone pointing out the utter uselessness of twitter hot takes and laughing at them. things are serious  but there s no cause for fear. gotta keep a reason to smile.
if only people fought in meme wars  not real ones. we are somewhat of memeLords here in finland.
I love it when melonie looks like she just stepped out the 90 s
I really enjoyed your video melonie  I needed to laugh and you gave it to me.  some people were glad for the russo-ukrainian war because they dont want trump to become president again. any person who wanted this war as it will affect all mankind is sick and wrong. keep up the laughs and great content melonie.
jokes in trying times are the best jokes.
leftist twitter reminds me thatscene in the last jedI  where rose  lectures  fin on how they will win the war by not  fighting what we hate  saving what we love   while a giant beam laser destroys the gate to the rebel base in the background. the irony speaks for itself.
remember when gandalf said  I found it is the small everyday deeds of ordinary folk that keep the darkness at bay. small acts of kindness and love.    yea  I love that quote and I think you are doing exactly that melonie  by supporting freedom however you can.. and simply laughing at the lunatics at twitter who  as always  are not helping at all.
dark humor is awesome  former military man here so my humor is all over the place. also  just made a twitch channel and followed you for sure.
here s one for your eventual video about ufoa  think what you will about the topic  but Ive seen some wild stuff over the years. nothing like a close encounter or anything  but some very unexplainable lights in the sky. I can recall 4 distinctly different events and each one had multiple witnesses other than myself  around 10 people in one case. three of them involved impossible movement based on what we currently know about propulsion technology  two of them involved 4th of july fireworks  and one of them was a double sighting. as myself and my original co-witness were describing what we saw to 3 other friends that came by like an hour later  the exact same thing happened again while they were present. they were all well before drone technology was where its at today  so unless they were top secret military experiments that we still haven t reached the potential of today over a decade later  thats off the table. oh and every one of them was completely different in terms of how they behaved. I dont have any answers but I can say without a doubt there s no way to conventionally explain what my acquaintances and I all saw in those instances.
hahahaha your disclaimer was perfect. humor  even dark humor  is definitely the best way to get through trying times. all meme s are welcome. if we take everything too serious the stress becomes more than anyone can handle and just makes everything seem hopeless. but with humor itshines a ray of hope and reminds us that we can all get through things together.
on a personal note as someone that used to work out religiously to deal with my issues. but has had to deal with four spinal surgeries in eight years  bi-polar and ptsd...the only thing keeping me alive is my dark twisted sense of humor.  those that cannot laugh at pain have not felt real pain.  my story is so damn dark yet my best friend and I laugh at my expense on a regular basis.  laughter truly is the best medicine.  the key difference is whether you are laughing  at  or   with.   stay true to yourself as you have been girl and forget those offended by it.  they suck anyways.
I love your comment about how they ll be begging for toxic masculinity when they need it for their own protection. great video as always. recently subscribed.
the world is indeed comic but the joke is on mankind  h.p.lovecraft. we need laughter in times like this so keep up  the great content and keep up the awesomeness.
apparently  a room full of primates banging on typewriters wont eventually reproduce shakespeare s works.  they actually produce tweets like these.
youre quickly becoming one of my favorite youtubers content creators. keep up the great work and I look forward to your future content!
excellent vod  mel! laughter is healing! your disclaimer  the memes  and the hot takes had me laughing up a storm. I love dark humor!
hey  if the soviet union gets back together  the democrats will love it again. bernie sanders can have his anniversary honeymoon in soviet russia again!
war not conflict
yeah. and people ignored the pipeline hypocrisy and stuff...
omfg when obama and putin were laughing that one time funny how no one bring thats up. talk about being someone puppet
I really dont like twitter either and im sure this might have a factor on it but there were also people in the ukraine posting about the movements of civilians and the military. youreally dont want your enemy to have a look into what youre doing with your military by simply looking at twitter
provide some examples of these people
melonie is the kinda person I could be around when it comes to talking about stuff like this! but tbh pray for every one!
aaaaaand subscribed.  thank you!  if anything  your pre-amble warning over on twitter was what compelled me to come over and listen.  if youre going to be that frank and honest  that people could be offended  it only makes me want to listen to you even more.  yes  I was also one of those teens that used to go out of my way to look for the albums taps cd s with the explicite lyrics logos back in the 90s.
my sense of humor is 100 times beyond normal dark humor
how could I just make a video about tomb raider or something  lol we love  you melonie mac!
thank you for going on the front line and doing this so we dont have to get stage v cancer reading twitter lmao
thanks melonie for the dark sense of humor.I needed the laughter takecare melonie
thanks melonie mac! I like your take on things. I hope your little doggie makes an appearance.
dark humor is how I cope with stuff. thanks for being you.
your disclaimer alone made me laugh so hard lol. on a more serious note the us and nato are under treaty to support ukraine  but all they re doing is placing sanctions... oh no.
anyone else have a nervous laugh I get hurt. I laugh.  do something embarrassing. I laugh.something dangerous happens and somehow I survive. I laugh.
as a person who lives in hawaiI Im more worried about china and them saying they will take taiwan yesterday. and I cant remember what chapter and verse it is but the Bible has a passage thatsays something like there are others out there that I take care of that you do not know of yet.... hmmm.... maybe aliens.
I love how you speak the truth! keep it up sister
I do always say  if you cant laugh at life you will only cry
perhaps I know best why it is man alone who laughs  he alone suffers so deeply that he had to invent laughter.  - nietzsche
awesome disclaimer!!! I was laughing so hard my drink shoot out my nose!!! dark humor is awesome helps us cope with situations. I pray for ukraine during this time but as I read revelations recently...a lot of signs are coming to light. ww3 might be happening soon...is everyone ready
melanie   disclaimer  this video might upset you.. giving you a heads-up!!! twitthead   oh my narratives!! I am upset and offfffended!!! aaaah!!! melanie   ha! told ya so!! go boom!!! everyone else   boom shake! shake! shake the room!!!!
thank you so much for these great videos!! there s a reason they call it comic relief in movies after something bad happens. laughter is healing!also the recent events have me actually reading revelation again. trying to remind myself not to be afraid in these times while also being a good reminder to continue doing God s work even when it becomes increasingly difficult. I love how you embody that with including the Bible verses at the end of your video! keep going boom  girl!
love your opinions and humor. the whole worlds going boom!!!
when you talked about aliens I remember hearing how I believe it was crowley summoned a demon back and portrayed it in a drawing and it looked liked the classic grey alien.
I actually did send the link of this video to my mom and Im pretty sure she ll be able to get some laughs from this.
been following on twatter for a while now.... finally got chance to catch an upload!  denjoyed it... shame the context is so abysmal    strangely finding myself drawn to biblical mythology recently and would like to read more. any suggestions on which version of the Bible you prefer to read or anything other than the Bible you could recommend   d
oh twitter  you never fail to entertain
melonie  in the mean time   go boomukrainians  you got it
some people fail to realize that you can be worried about something and take itseriously but also find a joke funny
dark humor is like food  not everyone gets it  c  joe stalin
this channel is the most ive heard you laugh mel xd love it!!!
thanks mel  I needed this video today.
I swear we need to bring back shock therapy for some of these individuals or something  some kind of research figure out how to fix these people
thanks melonie  I needed this
your going to be begging for toxic masculinity when you need to be protected
we re here to laugh with you  mac. God speed!
Im still in good company! awesome video as always!
once the vax became connected to the ability to  buy and sell  I knew  here we go  mark of the beast.
the truth is what I subscribed for.that being said  good job mel!
hard times create strong men  strong men create good times  good times create weak men  and weak men create hard times.  -quoted from a post-apocalyptic novel by the author g. michael hopf.
dark humor is great. for people who have been though crap it can be a sign that their going to be ok and pull through.
youre gonna need all that toxic masculinity when youre gonna need to be protected. anime uwu eyes  3
I haven t used twitter for several months. this video just convinced me to login so I can delete my account.
this was fun to watch
I do disagree on the aliens as demons theory  Ive heard it before from some Bible study teachers  but Im looking forward to your thoughts on it! hey would you wanna make a video for those of us who haven t been keeping up with the news and have no idea what all this russia ukraine stuff is
you cracked me up!...thanks for the laughter while driving around working
Ive deployed overseas. sometimes humor is the best medicine and helps brothers in arms bond.
I love your channel so much
if Im to be self reflective I sometimes use dark humor to avoid having to actually interact with an issue in an authentic way. and thats probably not productive. as opposed to using dark humor to cope with the stress of having interacted with the issue or being genuinely affected by it.
a small part of my childhood dies every time stephen king says something stupid.
in case youre not convinced how brain dead some people on twitter are  one person thought it would be smart to say  and I quote  and by quote  Imean I just copy pasted this    the rest of the world should just enjoy the apocalypse vibesevents like this are rare and we should live the moment  -  if that doesnt scream  noah  get the boat  I dont know what does
the big man upstairs knows.  Im worried about my family and kids.  but Ive figured I cant control everything but I can prepare the best I can and what happens  happens.  thanks for the video!
in dark times humour its the way to go
I just keep liking you more and more every video
correct after seeing my friends getting blown up in afghanistan one will go mad without dark humor. I d rather think of my friend making a joke of dying the way I know him to be than to think of his last moments.
that dana houle comment about ukrainians crowding together had to be a troll
as the world seems to burn  the smartest thing we can do  is read from our history so we cantry to find solutions from our past. love how you are connecting Bible passages with modern events! go boom!
left a like immediately after that intro disclaimer.
well king is after all a fiction wrighter. this video brightened my day. long live gallows humor.
hey dude  we could be in the end times. either way hanging with the Lord sounds like the best outcome in the end. so whatever comes its kinda a win win  d. great video keep it up!
this would make a good  melonie mac after dark  series. more unhinged humor!
I dont know if I can share a country with these people anymore... I hear ukraine is lovely this time of year.
2 36 the cool moment I notice melonie has one of my twitter responses loaded on the side of the video
keep up the excellent work  melonie.
life finds a way melonie.
I d say its more  gabriel  blow your trumpet!  vibes than anything else.
next time a kid says to me okay boomer Im gonna be like your damn right Im a boomer ! melonie mac go boom is awesome!

I have a very weird humor and I am a pc of sh1t Im pretty sure  no Im sure. keep  em coming!!! you keep me sane in this sh1t city of portland oregon.
sipping gamerjuice while the world is burning  yep thats a fellow boomer right there
your verse of the days are starting to make me miss the church
I have darker humor and you have now became my offical fav youtuber
we dont care about woke cringe we care about good content.
ngl  I love your sense of humour melonie  and Im here for it! boom
great video  mel...
no man knows the time of the second coming.wait.  wasn t this a sub-theme in one of the battles in Lord of the rings
im telling you japan is gonna be summoning gundams and evengelions to this war
all governments should make it law that you can only have a social media account if you can pass an iq and a common sense test.
watched the whole video . go boom!
so many wild memes from this invasion.
man  I love that melonie has gotten more and more red pulled as time goes on. thanks so much for starting this channel  loving itso much!
did you see the hilarious video of the applebee s commercial play after cnn s dramatic coverage ahahahaha
laughing at wokeists is good content.
my entire channel is almost exclusively dunking on woke cringe so...
twitter would lose 40  of its users  and 95  of its traffic.
@kopperneoman  um...wut
@14 41 is when I totally agreed with this entire video!
since you love dark humor and are a fan of blaire white  you should definitely give michael malice a follow.
that part about the aliens being demons...shit Christian and I talk about ! also  I freaking cant with people s posts on shitter ! cant call it twitter because its garbage xd ...ps I highly recommend the interview with richard grannon on triggernometry talking about the  epidemic of narcissism  ...lawlessness and Godlessness is leading people astray.
life is a cruel teacher  it kills all its students.as a vet I too have very dark humor.
wow buzzkill ending.... sadgeexcellent video though! lol
I should really remember to not get into online arguments  especially times like now when everybody and their pet goldfish has an opinion on ukraine. its one thing if we re at an even playing field  but more often than not  the other person is only playing with a half a deck of cards. if I wanted to waste time  I ought to just look at more memes and laugh in the face of a grim reality.
governments call sending other people s children to war  courage   and spending other people s money  generosity . supposedly paraphrased from joseph sobran.but whoever said it  its true.
thanks for the shout out sis lol
why is sora shaking hands with mario in the background
no worries honey there s no back here. say what you have to say  thats why we came here
I loooove this girl!!!
this video is hilariously funny and prayers for the people of ukraine caught in the middle  only God knows when the rapture will happen
dark humour is real humour
the shit goes boom!
akh! my poor fee fees  they are all stinging and sorefull! if only there had been a few more minutes of warnings  Imight have avoided this painful tweaking of my funny bone.
the   ... until blm  is most likely a 4chan trolling campaign.  at least I saw the idea floating around there
this community reminds me Im not alone in my sentiments towards this subject. God protect the righteous caught up in ukraine vs russia. ukraine will be in my prayers  but Im america priority one always.
this is awesome!! I love my dark humor!! dark humor is the best!!
first off  as someone who has an incurable brain cancer diagnosis  I am 5 years out and dark humor is a huge thing in our brain cancer community. humor is therapeutic!
melonie... I think someone spiked your gfuel.  you were off the chain today!
had to post this - job 38 31   meanwhile  astronomers have measured a noticeable difference in orion s belt.a friend was thumping the Bible and quoted job. then told me about these sightings.our current crisis seems to have direct correlation.
you cantell you have a good amount of native in you based on the structure of your eyes. you dont lack an epicanthic fold. which is due to your native ancestry.
melonie  check my dms on instagram about ukraine.  you ll be surprised. this is tony moro btw.
dark humor is like food.not everyone gets it.
old saying that might prove to be soon.  I dont know what weapons will be used in ww3  but I do know what ones will be use in the war after it. rocks and sticks.
Im just so  eh  or meh about it all. for many a quick death might be a blessing. I was kinda ready for the end times to get it over with back in the 90s when I was told repeatedly we were living in the end times.now Im like  yeah I guess  just one big slow apocalypse. might last til the end of the century idk.
I have dark humor and that is how I cope with stuff.  me too  melonie  me too.
cool vid but that transition from stupid tweets to yt comments was a hard one.
fire rescue here. dark humor is critical to wrestling with some of the shit we see.
just an fyI its pronounced kei-ev as in  ever.
if you ve seen death-especially violent death and a lot of it - or just had the occasional blood or brain matter splatter on your uniform shirt- or tried to save a life that you knew wasn t salvageable- or know you may have made a mistake that caused a life not to be salvageable - you eventually break down and cry. eventually you have trouble sleeping. eventually the night terrors come. maybe alcohol or drugs steals your soul in an attempt to comfort your spirit. some come to end it all. those of us who ultimately escape at least most of that darkness come to appreciate the darkness. facing the monster and smiling in its face actually scares the monster away. then you steal a little of the monster s soul and the result is dark humor.
let s put twitter s finest on the front lines  people!  they ve got this whole crisis figured out.
stalin says dark humor is like food - not everyone gets it comrade.
stephen king talking about standing up to bullies was hilarious. all these celebs need to just stay in their gated communities and shut up. maybe at one time these kind of people were important and actually did shit to make positive changes in the world  that isn t the case now. at times like this  we dont need them moralizing for the almighty social media clout.
Im just waiting for aoc s tiktok on how she almost died when the attack happened in ukraine.
I have no problem with joking with dark humor  oh I have stories  but our oil   food supplies are going to to major hits because of what they supply.  its not just us  they export to the world.  I do love the memes tho but I wish more would have been preparing instead of making fun of preppers
wow youre so beautiful melonie
this is just sad  time
I hate to be a doomer but these takes further prove to me that maybe a nuclear armageddon isn t such a bad idea anymore...
ice in her veins  -- - try liquid helium!
separate the ukrainian pronunciation  from russian.
and I see the twitter iq is still low.  sips tea
seriously though great video  it did make me laugh and I feel the same way  dark humour is what s going to bring us through this  whether to the end of the war or the world. either way lets do it together
I believe we are not yet in revelations  we are still in the  birthing pains  part  but we should all hold fast and be ready for the Lord s return  now more than ever.
it is what it is.  thats right. this girl is simple and wise.
the more these twitter lunatics talk  the more I think inventing the internet was a terrible mistake.
blaming either biden or trump for current events is demented.
Im just spending time with the wife   kids  playing some ps5 and keeping an eye towards the sky  for the big man to return . Im not ready but I really am... if you know what Imean.
I was talking to a uk vet from the 80s we shouldn t get involved but if we do only people who have been to war or have family in the forces who will be affected should be able to vote and if you can make any money from it you should have your vote taken away. no one in power should be able to come out a millionaire
I like seeing more and more people just speaking their mind and not giving a shit. hopefully this catches on and people wont need to remain the silent majorities in situations where speaking out can easily solve the problems.
hImelonie! great video!
melonie mac is currently my main source of news and wisdom. not cnn or fox  just melonie.
easiest pronunciation is  key-ev ... and thanks for the fun  humour is the way.
while it could be the end at any moment  and its good to be ready at any time  imo its not the very end per se. if the word  heavens  in revelation 12 12 refers to the material heavens  perhaps a conditional midpoint would be set  and it could be a fair bit of time depending on how fast things develop. it would at least be cool if space and the seas were colonized before its the last of the last days.
its kind of sad to watch so many idiots make such idiotic statements to the world with such pride. this whole situation is such a huge reminder of how childish we ve become.
there is questions you never ask  woman her age  man his salary  and ukranian farmer how he got his anti-aircraft system.
I haven t been on twitter too long  maybe one year  but some of the ukraine tweets I read today are the most deranged thing Ive seen there.
I love being british
you are right  no trump supporter backs putin in any way whatsoever  and in fact are likely more opposed to him than libs are.trump said  in his characteristically blunt  incautious way  was that what putin is doing is  genius   and it may be. what xI does is genius  what franco did was genius  what stalin did was genius......must it also be said that what h-man did was genius
mike drop  jean gentry!
russian here. and Im supporting all thats happening. thank you for the laughs  mel!
im not a boomer but I was fussing at some kids on a four wheeler last week telling them to get off my lawn.
Im a trump supporter who also backed putin. so youre wrong about that.thatsaid  I cant back todays events. russia has some legitimate issues and beef with nato that cant just go ignored or dismissed.but launching a full scale attack like this was unecessary and foolish. including for putin. the optics are so terrible that whatever legitimate grievances he had with nato will be completely drowned out by images of russian gunships and jetplanes bombing targets all across ukraine.a more prefarable course of action would ve been to reinforce donetsk and luhansk but not going further. but putin is lapsing in judgement at this point.
@seven proxies   obviously  my remarks were in reference to the current conflict  so  youre wrong about that .and you do not have a clue as to what is really going on here.putin wants to reconstitute the territories of the old ussr as a non-marxist russian empire  stalin fashion  by creating false issues with russian minorities planted in adjacent countries in the ussr days for the purpose  by conducting a series of small conquests as opportunities arise. this would be a disastrous eventuality for the free world  should he succeed.unfortunately  given biden s weakness and the west s dissolution   from putin s point of view  launching a full scale attack was wise and therefore inevitable  putin sees weakness  he takes as much he can as fast as he can. period.it will cost him nothing  and the motive has nothing to do with any unnamed  petty  issues with nato . it has everything to do with the centuries-old phenomenon of russian self-aggrandizement and jingoism  nothing more.russia has no  legitimate issues  with nato  certainly none of any consequence  which is why you didn t name any.the trouble with people like you is that you let yourself be preemptively brainwashed by russian propaganda exclaiming that any neighboring country simply being free and independent of russia is a  threat  to russia  so anything russia does is preemptively justified.  this is just a tiresome re-hash of the same mentality that made the ussr such problem for so long during the unnecessary cold war.history repeats.....you need to de-findlandize  your brain.
@seven proxies   and from your remarks I concllude  you should get out of the habit of telling other people about themselves.I avoid relying on big media like I avoid the plague  but I do rely on the best historians I can find  historians  it would appear you never heard ofe.g. george kennan  russia and the west under lenin and stalin   stephen kotkin   stalin  waiting for hitler   michael voslensky  nomenklatura    winston churchill  shirer  solzhenitsyn.....
@seven proxies   oh yes  and btw  if putin  definitely doesnt  want to reconstitute the old ussr  why does he say above all  we should acknowledge that the collapse of the soviet union was a major geopolitical disaster of the century. as for the russian nation  it became a genuine drama. tens of millions of our co-citizens and co-patriots found themselves outside russian territory. moreover  the epidemic of disintegration infected russia itself.
@occhamite  because he s a politician  what they say and what they have in mind rarely if ever coincide.he also said the troops were being pulled back in feb 16. but what actually happened in the end he s been using misdirection throughout his entire presidency to keep people guessing. all according to a sun tzu philosophy and a bit of machiavellI too.if youre gonna understand putin you ll have no chance if you take everything he says at face value.
@seven proxies   I didn t expect any kind of real answer  but that reply takes the cake for sheer idiocy.so then  history is useless  the media is useless  95 true   so what then do have left ouija boards crystal balls btw  nobody has yet given an example of any issue russia has with nato  let alone an issue of any consequence.
the  alpha and omega  Jesus said has nothing to do with leadership and being an alpha as we use it today. these are simply the 1st     and last     letters of the greek alphabet  the sentense means that he is all things  the beggining and end   I am greek so I study the Bible in modern and ancient greek language .  greek language was the first language the new testament was written in if I remember correctly  old testament was either hebrew or greek    hence we can understand better the meaning if we read the greek or hebrew.
you know what the world needs right now  they need celebs to sing a john lennon song compilation.
I dont think this is the ww3  maybe a forewaring  because a kinda huge event will happen before the real ww3...the thing that worries me is if russia allies try to do the same with other countries  like india  taiwan  thailand  south korea or japanmeanwhile what we can do is join together praying for the ukranian people
what about he possibility that God has set life on multiple worlds thatsimply dont know about each other as part of his plan  whatever that plan may be
love your dark humor. would love to have you on my channel. I discuss politics and culture war issues would you be interested in coming on
dont worry melonie  we re not russian to make any dark jokes here  ukraine be sure about that.
I see the military surroundings rubbed off on you  my friend. a lot of troops  especially marines  use dark humor to deal with dire situations. we honestly get pretty messed up with our jokes  but it helps. anyway  Im gonna go eat some crayons.
for the algorithm!
when you say that you dont believe aliens are real  it feels like you are talking about santa. are yourefering to people that claim they have seen flying saucers  or what scientists think about the probabilty of life in the universe
unfiltered mel  yay!
melonie  with you mentioning that extraterrestrials are likely not real  I think the following verse needs more examination mark 13 27   and then he will send forth the angels  and will gather together his elect from the four winds  from the end of the earth to the end of heaven. I considered the idea of God not being occupied with life on other planets  but that verse basically threw a wrench in that for me.  Jesus is basically saying there are elect in the heavens  meaning the cosmos.  the existence of extraterrestrials cannot undermine anything God Christ has said.  they are basically a form of extraterrestrials themselves  the kingdom of heaven is even talked about like its another galaxy that will merge with ours.  it adds to the potential.deuteronomy 29 29  the secret things belong to the Lord our God  but the things that are revealed belong to us and to our children forever  that we may do all the words of this law. I cant help but consider that explicit knowledge of extraterrestrials is something God wants to protect us of from  knowing how crazy humans can get.  a frickin toilet paper war occurred due to people s reactions to the rona.  Im not saying e.t.s are real  but  partly due to scripture  I dont understand dissing the potential.
I dont think it makes much sense to assume that life on other planets is somehow  evidence  that God isn t real.and Im not even a man of faith myself.the problem is that many Christians just go by the translation of the Bible in their local language  while only scholars know the appropriate context of biblical terminology since they are more likely to be familiar with the ancient greek and hebrew versions of the book.so if youread genesis in english  it may sound like God created  the world   as in the entire universe  in 7 days and that man was one of the first living creations etc.now if we discount allegory for a moment  the conception of  the world  in ancient languages didn t necessarily refer to the universe. there s a lot of fair interpretations that could mean that  world  refers to planet earth or  creation as we know it .same thing about the  seven days of creation . a  day  doesnt necessarily mean 24 hours  because it could be a  day  in the way God measures time. so for all we know a day in divine terms could comprise billions of human years.so there is no actual conflict between the possible existence of extra terrestial life and Christian faith whatsoever.and  once again  Im not even a Christian myself. but Im here to argue in favor of their faith.
I dont have anything to say so here s your interaction for the day.
having a dark sense of humor and being tone-deaf are two different things.

trump showed his support for putin and the invasion on his own social media place now. fox news even talked about it. so  if you aren t on either of those  that might be how you did not see anything about him supporting it. trump even showed his support to putin at a political fundraiser at mara lago this week as well.
maybe add  isaiah 5 20 -- 25  good vs evil
key-ev  is its pronunciation
I dont get why people would think aliens would disprove God.
Im so glad Im not on twitter and never have been  there are so many people on there who have no idea what they are talking about  speak and just look stupid.
a stint at the front in ukraine would help some of these crazies

better to stay silent and be thought of as a fool than to speak up and remove all doubt.
cenk suffers from the dunning-uygur effect.
if you want to learn how to say acquiescing  watch pirates of the caribbean
yes walk into the dark
our entire government is likely in on this tbh

13 52  lavender   who seems to be a young woman. just looked up king s wikipedia page  to see when he was born  which was in 1947. so unlike you  if my initial assumption of you beeing a woman is correct  king very well was at least in danger to have to fight over a pretty long time in a bunch of conflicts his country was in  you on the other hand wouldn t have to...
dark humor is like kids with cancer
hI there!!
rob reiner is so delusional.
wow....smh  these people are lost  they have no understanding and should seek yeshua hamashiach
you know how you say everyone makes things about race  what if that was actually smart a.i. posting and not a real person at all  how much of that is running through twitter  ya know.
glad I haven t gone back to twitter. too many people that fit the  Im a piece of       mold that melonie hinted at.
the Bible says that God is the alpha and the omega. it doesnt say God is the beta and the omega.
mel. normally love your takes but a lot of the shit people are saying about right wing supported are getting that because tucker carlson was out there saying it.
all I know is I bought ethereum this morning and have already made  300 on  2400...
I came here because Im a piece of shit.. stayed for the piece of shit.
I cannot stand the fact that you have to say  coof  and mock inject yourself in the shoulder to avoid flak from youtube.   I do appreciate it though because I am sick of seeing those stupid ass  information  ---lol banners under videos.
the marvel shows are lame. maybe moon knight can shake things up  but Im not holding my breath
john bolton  who served as the white house national security adviser to trump   in a second trump term  I think he may well have withdrawn from nato   bolton said.  and I think putin was waiting for that.  putin saw an american president moving in a direction moscow liked  and the russian leader was waiting for trump to finish the job.putin wanted to undermine the nato alliance  and trump undermined the nato alliance. putin wanted to weaken the e.u.  and trump made little effort to express his disdain for the e.u. putin wanted to help authoritarians  and trump cozied up to authoritarians. putin wanted to hurt ukraine  and trump launched an extortion scheme that threatened to hurt ukraine. former president donald trump on tuesday described russian president vladimir putin s invasion of ukraine as  genius  and  savvy  . as men  women and children were dying.
remember mel. everything and anything is always trumps fault
sorry but blaire white is cringe
its not america s business to deal with russia and ukraine. america is not the world police. let the un and nato go over there deal with it
folx
good you didn t cover this one who regrets thatshe wasn t putin s mother...  one of the cringests vids Ive seen!
I just uploaded a parody of that on twitter
on the whole demons vs aliens thing. Im not saying youre wrong but I also would not say that if aliens exist they disprove God s existence. that just seems silly to me. he may very well have created other races on other planets they may be intelligent they may be just animals or they may not exist. but either  way it does not disprove God s existence.  Imean we are talking about the being who created all things! how brilliant  beautiful  and creative is the mind of God! let s nit put limits on someone wr can barely comprehend. as far as aliens not being in the Bible. should they be  the Bible is for mankind and has the things that are relevant for us to know God as he wants us to know him. his relationship with other beings  be they extraterrestrial or celestial or anything else  really is irrelevant to his relationship to us and us to him.absolutely love your videos and your content. wish there were more women like you.
1. ukraine is overdosing  from what  I dont get it.2. imagine being so racist that all you see is putin s skin color and not his actions!
to deny God is to deny your senses. diversity of life makes itstatistically impossible life here was not guided by design.
who cares if ukraine is being attacked!  are people using the correct pronouns! !
were youreally not aware of trump and his cultists praising putin  supporting russia  and blaming biden and nato when you made this video
---  I support putin!!  ---
I dont know about your humor. but europe  china and russia will be together. I wonder who will support america  as your country is only draining resources and is thought to be very great...sorry for the people born there ....
no wonder puddin ain t scared of the us lol
