if kotaku was bought and turned into a satire site  no one would notice the change.
this guy was already a nut to begin with  just look at his background. Im tired of the msm blaming movies  tv  video games and music for things like this. maybe if we took mental health more serious in this country and stopped glorifying it  maybe this guy would of gotten the help he needed.
here melanie is a quick review of gamaergate. for a long time there was a disconnect between the games people were playing and the big reviewers. not being in the room no one could quite put their finger on what was wrong but the reviews and game quality weren t matching up. then zoe quinn put out depression quest. a piece of crap that would have barely qualified as a game in the zork era. but major review websites heaped it with glowing praise. gamers were stunned and confused. but then it happened. it turns out zoe cheated on her boyfriend with one of the reviewers.  so he revealed everything. all the backroom dealings that had led to skewed reviews for years. angry gamers finally knowing what was wrong grabbed their torches and pitchforks and went to lay siege to the castles of gaming review websites. as they saw their doom approach they suddenly heard a thunderous sound. astride her mighty white horse her armor gleeming in the sun zoe quin rode into the battle and leaped between the oncoming attacks and the game reviewers. its all about me. me! me! look at these evil sexists attacking a poor defenseless woman for daring to make a videogame. wont anyone send me money to protect me  and seeing their salvation the gaming reviewers shouted.  her! her! its all about her. look at all these sexist gamers. and so the battle began.
gamegate was about transparency  accountability  and honesty in journalism. but they couldn t have any of thatso they just needed to just say that gamers are bad people.meanwhile they had no problems trading favorable reviews for sexual relations.
this is proof we as gamers are the most oppressed
this is gamer country  they yelled at paul at 3 00am while he was eating subway.
goes to show  they ll find a way to blame anyone for their actions but themselves.....
oh my goooooshhhh  canthese people go one day without blaming gamers for everything!!!!    like damn its not that hard to do that
in the 80s they always blamed metal heads  today its gamers.  there is always a scapegoat of some kind to avoid the actual issues.
no wonder modern gaming journalism is rotting in the ground
I have to say. you handle the back lash very well melonie. and remember we re here for you.
blame us gamers all you want kotaku  blame us gamers all you want. its not gonna make a damn difference
I get death threats because I post pictures of bacon.  - welcome to the internet  everyone!
I knew that regardless of this dude s background that the media would connect this invasion and attack to january 6  but Imust admit I didn t imagine that they would manage to say its related to gamergate. thank you for this... I was highly amused by this article.
I got soap in my eye this morning. damn you gamergate!
kotaku is trying to stay relevant but choosing woke audience will cause opposite effect actually. david is woke af too.
gamergate caused me to wear a powdered wig and then become a hat salesman while forecasting the weather  go around collecting boulders while delivering ubereats  take over playgrounds while working at applebees  and gave me a bad case of the holler n. and what did I get out of all of it  cancer aids. 10 10  would sweetie squad again.
gamergate is living in their heads rent-free.
this is just hilarious! not the attack  but gamergate  really   and I assumed that gamergate was like comicsgate mostly just fans saying games sucks that reviewers praise. so they get branded as toxic or ...gate. thats how it was with comicsgate  I should know because I interacted with a lot of people who hated woke comics and  started  comicsgate.
kotaku just hates video games lmaooo
elon should buy them just for the public meltdowns that would follow
not least because no-one reads it.
except satire is usually based on reality. you find none of that in kotaku.
wait kotuku is an satire site is it not.
we really need a elon to buy all this trash over and restore independent thought!!
he also profited off inside trading covid policies from his wife.
lol nah its the latent effects of night trap rearing their ugly head.
the excuse never gets old because thats what incompetent parents do  all their child s problem are not their responsibility but the movie games music comic or friends etc etc.strawman  strawman everywhere.
@chris m  youre all doing the blame game genius. how could you possibly not see it
@eh ha  always so emotional. calm down  karen.
this was written better than rings of power.
yeah  pretty much.
@vincent werts  yes  it was
I thought she slept with five reviewers  the funniest part is that gamergate wasn t even right wing.
@vincent werts  thatsentence was written better than rinks of powder...
so many grifters and hustlers came out of that crying  muh sexisuhm  and the media amplified the lie. it was never about females  it was about honesty and accountability. before gamergate  the review sites just didn t make sense most of the time with their low effort reviews  gamergate just blew the doors open on all of journalism.
@anonymous cheese  damn right
@rambleon07  really
of course its a kotaku article that wrote this  seeing that nathan grayson was the kotaku writer who was one of the main characters in gg with zoe quinn.
@ricky uzumaki  thats how I remember it but I could easily be wrong. its been a long time lol
their fixation on one bit of pushback against their vile behaviour is getting into the realms of a neurosis. these people are not healthy in the head.
they have rewritten history and their lies about gamergate are now everywhere including wikipedia. scary stuff. so many other topics where this is the case.
@raskolnikov  I checked that to learn what gamergate is. fun fact the unbiased true story popped off as 5th-6th choice on google. the rest is  alt-right movement   death threats etc etc
they werent reviews  but positive coverage and reach. technical  but important difference.
they always find something to blame  first it was music  than it was movies they failed at pinning blame on both so they moved on to games  they even blamed yugioh for encouraging satanic rituals. its not just game s or gamers  in a couple of years time they will find something else to blame.
yup  and man was zoe quinn a nasty piece of work.
@charming peasant  it also wasn t an exchange. it wasn t  I ll sleep with you in exchange for  but simply a relationship. a journalist shouldn t be writing about their lovers  friends  or projects they re financially tied to.
Imean  if disliking zoe quinn because she s obviously a talentless  dishonest heaux makes me a sexist  then you can call me one any day.gaming  journalism  is a complete bought and payed for  heavily biased joke. if they hate people like me for being toxic or sexist  I wear that like a badge of honor.
@max  damn right!
Imean gamergate did turn into people sending death threats and making very sexist remarks. some good intentioned things get twisted of course when its put on the internet full of angry manchildren who are way too obsessed with their gaming world.we cant have anything anymore.
@anonymous cheese  it was never suppose to be about them but that didn t stop radical people from taking it too far.
@chandler burse  goo goo ga ga ppplllbbbtttt!
@nooctip  oh I see you probably spat up your apple sauce. kids on the internet these days.
psa sitch made an excellent video on gamer gate. highly recommend if you want a gamer gate 101 class
I thought it was about highjacking quality storytelling in the medium to replace it with woke garbage
yes  we are
it must ve been a build up from all the nwords the 13 year olds on fortnite lobbies
cant wait until dave chappelle tells the story the famous italian businessman paulo pelosi.
enthusiastic slow clap
calling gamer gate a far right movement is like calling africa a country
@androvsky  indeed
I agree its stupid and it was getting stupid before but like trying to bring up a thing that happened years ago and is completely separate from this does not make any sense to me
been doing since the  90s bro its like they wont shut the hell up
yeah poor eddie from stranger things
the issue is leftist cognitive dissonance.
except back then the shoe was on the other foot. twilight zone man
and tabletop rpgs. it feels so personal!  -p
well  metal heads were a symptom of the issues. those issues are just mainstreamed today.
@hiraghm  metal heads in general were not a cause of issues. some people just enjoy metal.
@hiraghm  wtf are you on about
indeed
vegans obviously
@guy gadbois  maybe they have pig pronouns
@timbothruster afterburn      my pronouns are  they them  and  oink
@guy gadbois  Im an f-16  my pronouns are chaffs flares  sidewinder!!
it turned out a developer was fucking a writer at kotaku. when people started pulling that thread it ended revealing that a goodly chunk of gaming journalist lacked any sort of integrity. of course since they were the journalists and lacked integrity they just lied about the whole thing and people believed them.
they dont buy nor play any of these things
the more I see of these videos the more I love them. that   I get death threats for posting pictures of bacon  line was so funny and I adored the death cosplay yesterday...which is what I was going to write until she showed some of the messages she gets which were deeply disturbing. I was quite disgusted. its upsetting thatsomebody has to go through that. she ought to name and shame  Imean  why protect people like that
kotaku is one of the biggest jokes on the internet and gaming is just the easiest thing to blame...gaming exists around the world and they dont have problems that hoodie is btw
forgets chicken in the oven and it is all burned nowkotaku  gamergate causes famine
breaking  kotaku s shared brain was dropped  kicked by accident  and fell down 2 flights of stairs.  no new damage  though they re still trying to clean the dog hair off.  please allow time for kotaku to find an equilibrium again. its believed there are still two functioning cells.
Ive played video games most of my life.  Ive never wanted to attack anyone as a result of my hobby.
they always need a scape goat for everything and these individuals cant seem to let gamer gate go. which hasn t been a thing in almost a decade. lmao
what is a kotaku  is some kind of pok mon  maybe its a new kind of  otaku   never heard about it... thanks for bringing it up.
men who get jealous when cute girls get attention have a broken perception of reality.
love the ren   stimpy hoodie. so cool. I dont really know anything about gamer gate. lol I love it when you get to words you cant pronouns. I do the same thing at times. its amazing how people attack you over your jokes. they just need to get over it and gain a sense of humor.you look beautiful melonie. love your hair. interesting video. have a good day.
its true about gamergate and jan. 6.   they colluded with bigfoot  too.
for those who didn t know   a couple of game journos were caught writing reviews for games while being  friendly  with the devs.  it ended up exposing thatsites like kotaku didn t review games based on merit  and most journos just held a shadow council on private forums to decide how to rate games.  that lead to some gamer communities to link up  and they boycotted the sponsors of kotaku  g-spot  etc.  it crushed the gaming websites  and the ideologs of those gaming websites have been trying to connect gamer gate to any conspiracy they can reach.  I see going broke didn t convince kotaku to get rid of all of their activists who still feel the need for revenge.  if you ask nicely  I ll bet we could get a gaming journo to explain  straight faced mind you  as to how gamergate caused the jfk assassination and the irish potato famine  p
the lotus eaters did a video on this mad story too. they seem to have dug up more info about it and have drawn interesting inferences. I recommend checking it out if youre following the case
oh bloody hell! we re doing this  give me a break.
from hearing the story  paul and his  friend  totally got hammered.seriously though a lot of the details is really sus. like the glass that was broken was outside the house not inside  the time between a call and that  friend s  presence  and then the security getting there was longer than it needed to be  which is sus and there are more details.
gamergate tried to overthrow the government! -kotaku
people like to diss gg nowadays  but the truth is that we hurt them so bad their scars still burn.never forget to raise a glass for all the dead gamers every august 28.
kotaku thinks if a bird shits on someone its because it was  radicalize by gamergate
next  gamergate caused wwiii
in a digitized decentralized social media landscape  kotaku are desperate because they re now obsolete. time for kotaku and their friends to go the way of the fax machine and be unplugged and displayed in a museum.
they always blame those who want to be left alone.
lol yep
same here
as someone who has been around the gaming fandom your experience is not worth much considering there are indeed many crazed fans in certain niches who will act very angry over the littliest of things. people who get so worked up over the littlest of  wokeness  they can poke at in a game to people who will send you death threats if you hate or like a game they dont.
and by  friendly  we mean engaging in sexual activity.
honestly.
this is juicy smollett all over again.
@randomninja  not familiar with the situation in detail  but it wouldn t surprise me.
@murderless crow  ok its coming back to me now. that was seriously messed up.


yup
you deal with all the hate so well  though. you know I always pray that God protects you and gives you the strength to deal with thatstuff. go boom!
comes out from the shadows to see what is going on with gaming.........goes back into the shadows again to play pre-2015 games
oh here we go again with this  gamergate  bullshit
they have to keep gg alive somehow  use it for everthing
all roads lead back to gamergate
kotaku has a chip on their shoulder about gamergate due them being exposed for having some members and journalists who were receiving  smexual favors  from zoe quinn and other women in exchange for posting articles and giving them popularity. they were big mad about being exposed  lmao.
if games and movies cause violence  why do the parent corporations of game and media  including news  companies continue to make such entertainment
its not the biggest  reach  by the mediaits the biggest  reach around
this guy must have been one hell of an athlete to fight his way to the front of the queue to do this.
Im gonna have to deep search this term gamergate  because even Im wondering about it  also. I saw that you were being harassed yesterday  me and my hackers shut them down  thanks to the edgerunners. I dont like hate groups.
the far fetchness surrounding this story is wild.
making money is an action. keeping money is behavior. growing money is knowledge.
Im surprised. I thought kotaku had ceased to exist.
political groups in charge of what comes out of entertainment  influence how we consume entertainment  and force us to consume which entertainment that is acceptable to their eyes get attacked.political groups   its the entertainment fault!
at this point it feels like a very strange thing to bring up in general I know they re just doing the tagline of the article for clicks but like its crazy that thats the only thing they bring up now
this sounds like the biggest reach  yay halo reach !
can I blame dungeons and dragons for losing my last job  dont worry pathfinder  we re still friends.
gamergate the grift that keeps on grifting.
seriously!  at this rate  I honestly dont know what they havent blamed to gamergate!! desperate cant even begins to describe how desperate they are!
the spinning here by the media is soo hard Im getting motion sick.
this makes me roll my eyes
yes indeed
yup. kotaku was the original spark thatstarted gamergate. I wonder if their writers are still trading booty for ratings.
@william jenkins  they are probably doing it even more now that people know they will accept booty instead of credentials  lol.
@chaosdragoon1  true  30 minutes of slap and tickle is alot easier then making a whole game.
it was a very awesome transformation  no greater joy than seeing my progress in an initial decision..

stop this nonsense. I know you guys are tryna sell something
pretty much
yeah  Ive been playing games since pong in the 70s  and we got blamed for society s problems even back then.
lol! this is madness  while I think parents need to pay attention to the games media their kids consume   at a young age  the idea that a person whom commits an act of violence had some vague interest in games  somehow makes the two things correlate  is insanity.
wow between the duI and now hammer time this man is having the time of his life
wow! just freaking wow. these people have a societal agenda and they dont care how irrational they must become to advance it. just wow.
they re quickly running out of people to blame for their stupidity.
its because gamergate catapulted a lot of their media opposition into the public eye.
yes kotaku Im sure the nudist crazy homeless man was a big gamer. stop kotaku
it was gamers who attacked jussie smollett!
the industry has improved on diversity over time .  which is why the usual suspects are losing their shit because it turns out that bayonetta likes men  unlike their creepy fan fiction.
they should watch who they defend bold of them to rush to the aid of hypocrits
we also had great female characters in the early 90s. I think of samus aran  technically 80s but whatever   chun lI  maI shiranuI  and sonya blade to name a few examples. oh  and thats not even mentioning lara croft  because. . . .
man  kotaku still talking about gamergate huh
what. the. actual .you know what nvm screw these people. these people deserved to be treated with the utmost contempt.
guy was obviously an aspiring hammer bro.
is that a ren and stimpy hoodie  love it!
hImelonie this is bunch of bs why they blame games on the attack he s done he s only to blame himself.I absolutely   your outfit today .takecare melonie
Im sorry this isn t on topic but .......your hair looks amazing.
theyre desperate for gamergate to come back  even though it was never really a thing to start with  because they have no other ways to get clicks. God forbid the game journalist write about games or something like that
fly dives into coffee. curse you gamergate and your infernal deeds!
gamergate is the only thing they have left  Im laughing from how pathetic this is.
text meabove to receive reward thanks for watching
this is wario country!
agreed
her hair looks good in a ponytail  in my opinion.
great video melonie!!
two hundred years from now  the descendants of these  journalists  will still be screaming y u no care about gamergate!
it goes all the way back to paper and pencil d d in the 70 s.
its difficult to take kotaku seriously especially after one of their writers wrote about how terrified she was about the holes on the xbox series x instead of giving us a proper console review back in 2020.
oh yeah  gamergate  well I blame the rap music lol
I saw an article about how the theythem hotd actress is great at playing female characters... yeah  I really wonder how that could be. its quite the mystery honestly.
there has only been one victim of gamergate  his name was alec holowka and zoey quinn s lies forced him to minecraft himself. they really are trying to rewrite history
thats an interesting hoodie you got on. is gamergate ever going to die  Im so sick of hearing that its gamergate s fault because of ____.
the week when  gamergate  hit I remember all the mainstream games journos were putting out articles simultaneously  how  gamers are dead dont matter   something to thatsentiment  and how they were all bullies and misogynist ... kinda sus that they would release articles all at once with the same sentiments on various outlets  its as if they had a mailing list  and co-ordinated with eachother.  kinda weird that these gaming websites would attack gamers seeing that gamers are their audience which they need.
oh shit gamergate strikes again.
eye opener for me about kotaku on several occasions being woke and also shitting on gamers. youngyeah reads from them alot. kotaku seems to be a left sided platform that they throw shit from.
the only people who benefited from gamergate is modern journalists who learned that they can put out whatever information they like if they can spin their audience into demonizing another group.
the drunk driver that got attacked !
hooray for ren stimpy!
yea   soldier of fortune    made them do it
gg was about ethics in games journalism. the society for professional journalists cleared us. it was lived streamed. so  I imagine its still around somewhere. these cranks still consider us the boogie-man these years later because we beat them. not that they and the msm will ever admit it.
if gaming culture ever needs an enema the hose will be inserted into kotaku headquarters.
game journos released a shit tonne of articles attacking gamers  some gamers responded under the hashtag gamergate instead of accepting the label of bigots and racists the media was trying to push.
love your ren   stimpy hoodie!
gamergate was a hate movement started in 2014 by zoe quinn and anita sarkeesian
probably

it isnt even  as if . it later came out that they did co ordinate. the corrupt jurnos circled the wagons.
@william jenkins  wow
indeed it will
kotaku is beyond grasping at straws.
random thought.I feel like we could be legit friends if we were to ever talk in real time.not simping. not meaning to be a creeper. I just really like your personality and think we could have fun conversations.
blame gamers and games when most of us know he was doing weird shit behind closed doors. its all just a cover up for their sick ways. always.
I ll take  impossible reaches  for 1000  alex.
hey melonie I hope you have a good day
metokur and sargon are my favorite gamergaters
let s see it from another point of view. they pushed so much to tell us that mommy and grandmommy who play candy crush are gamers that we can blame them for the pelosI attack!
those gamerz cant keep getting away with this!
I didn t know you were a pikmin  melonie! thats so cool!
gamergate opinion discardedGod  that rag should ve been out of business a long time ago  and dont give them clicks!  if you have to read that obvious trash used archived versions!
all I know  is that if this guy had attacked anybody else  given the state the attack took place in  there is a good chance he would have been booked and released the same day.
I think youre right to not take the  attack  seriously  but you might be wrong about it not being  p.r. believe it or not  what we do know is that the so-called victim  after being  allowed  to go to the bathroom with his phone  was heard over that phone calling the attacker by his first name  and his  friend . I think its at least as likely paul is into some sort of kink  and it got out of control.
awesome channel
perfect example of why kotaku and other like jurnos are failing both in life and by the numbers.
melonie itsounds like the biggest reach around to me.
I figured it out  it was mortal kombat ... blame it on mortal kombat  the perp was trying to perform a hammer fatality on someone in rl.
afaik gg was when it was discovered a game dev was sleeping with a journo for good reviews.
what does the k in kotaku stand for  I know what otaku means.
stimpy you vidiot! your hoodie gives me nostalgia. its soo 90 s I luv it.
why do they think gamers are evil...
by the way  the attacker wasn t right wing anything  so keep spreading those lies craptaku.
love ren and stimpy!
culture warriors.  hmmmm. I can role with that. I like it. thatshould be our new label for every non woke geek and gamer everywhere.
he had a hammer but was mostly peaceful.
ren   stimpy jumper. you have good  taste. powdered toast and a bowl of sugar frosted sod pops is a highly nutritious breakfast too.
every time you say go boom it reminds me of that flight of the conchords song.
can game journalists even game  I remember watching that one  journalist  that failed cup head tutorial.
it would have turned out differently if they d had guns in their house they re supposed to have armed secret service protection outside their house  yes  the family of representatives are protected  too . so where were they and how d he get past them
they ve been doin thatsince pong
thank God steam reviews are still a thing. these gaming journalists dont know their ass from a hole in the ground.
gamer gate is responsible for everything that happened ever there is only bgg and agg to these ppl
I thought gamer gate started with gamers saying   modern game journalism has nothing to do with games   because everything was about race and gender . and journalists just attacked attacked and attacked afterwards.
kotaku is about the views  I never click on the site.  they like the hate just as much as the love  views equal dollars either way.
damn  we hit n all the buzzwords today.
smart and beautiful  unmatched
its all strange. the dude who pooped on their drive way was snatched up within seconds
since you mentioned people taking issue with you celebrating halloween  I just wanted to say thatsome Christians dont celebrate halloween because of its pagan origans. I am a Christian myself  but I try not to get too uptight about other Christians celebrating halloween  just as long as they are not celebrating the pagan elements of it. Christmas also has pagan elements  but that is not what I am celebrating when I celebrate Christmas. I think its good to be aware of the pagan origans of halloween  but just because someone is celebrating halloween  that dosen t mean that they are celebrating the pagan elements of it.
gamergate being blamed for something in 2022  I totally forgot that was a thing.
nice sweater melonie!
isn t kotaku a gaming magazine or website   and they wonder why gatekeeping should exist  I say should cause it really doesnt  when supposed gamers and our mouthpieces now support the bunked narrative from 30 years ago that video games cause this shit.
like eric july said  these ppl are npc s.they just combined every political issue over the last 10 years into one issue.
one reason I think it was possibly a pr stunt
thats more or less accurate
appreciate your support towards my channel 
its supposed to be. and agreed
they played the blame game with  music  films  video games  even books. hell  they even blamed the rise in literacy centuries back for the youth being lazy and not going out to work. with this logic  we should just ban every form of storytelling possible because it will  incite violence . people have been using everything but the real problem as blame  time and time again. its nothing knew.
its not just game s or gamers  when music came out that was seen as bad  when they reported on the columbine shooting they looked at the music those kids listened to and blamed it on the music  they will just end up blaming the next idea that appears. as for getting criticized about celebrating halloween  people mistake halloween for the devils holiday when its not really a celebration at all  it derives from all hallows eve  in some countries such as north america its a day to reunite with dead loved ones as they believe its the one day of the year their loved ones return to check on family members  the act of dressing up and wearing masks was actually meant to disguise oneself as along with the good the bad spirits would also appear. halloween has no evil or good form of worship.
kotaku.  still exists
bacon is great!!!
they continue to lie about that insignificant little moment. gamergate was about the three editors for gaming websites slept with zoe quinn for positive press. thats it. they are constantly writing articles and wikis spreading false information about what happened.  the only thing gamergaters got was full disclosure. gaming websites had to tell people if the product they review is under thier parent company. thats it.
there once was a time when rap music was considered to be source of all evil on the continent.  before that  it was comic books. same old  same old.
this reminds me back when they said  grand theft auto is the reason crime is happening.   but a few things. 1. love the hoodie. 2. why are politicians using games to blame why someone did something. why not investigate why said person attacking. idk much about gamer-gate because I dont look into it  but come on man chill. and thankfully paul isn t dead. I dont think anyone should lose there life even if you dont agree with them.
oddly enough from what Ive read halloween used to be a Christian holiday and Christmas was a pagan holiday. strange how they flipped.
this is what happens when 2  guys  put hammers where they do not belong and somebody gets mad. funny to me they tried to say some rando broke into the house that belongs to the 3rd most powerful moron in the us. stay safe out there melonie and everyone else.
gamers caused my car to break down.
kotaku journalists ... lmaoo ... let s just have some fun with that again   kotaku journalists . I hadn t heard of kotaku since the last time I checked gothamist. which was about 2017.
funniest thing Ive heard this week. and the braindead kotaku enjoyers ate it up
love the hoodie mm!
gamergate has had more resurrections than jason voorhees.I doubt most gamers even know who she is  I only know who she is because I watch mark dice
the house of the 3rd highest ranking official in the u.s. has no surveillance cameras. yeah  that tracks.
gamergate is the most powerful entity that has ever existed. why do you think cthulhu lives in the depths of the sea  he doesnt want to mess with gamergate!
people blame gamers for everything because  it is mathematically probable a neck beard nolife was involved
kotaku can...uh  probably shouldn t finish thatsentence.
a gamer would have swung until the twitching started. when we put someone or something down  we make sure its at 0 hp.
I like the way you did your hair on this one. hella cute.
eeeyup
agree and I dont like it when the media wants to look for a scapegoat when something bad happens in the world and its gta s fault or its mk s fault or its cod s fault for why people are getting the crime rates up. its silly to me.
games have been blamed for violence for years. its not anything new.
@chandler burse  I agree with you and the media always loves to beat up that dead horse when something bad happens and put the finger on either gaming or music or movies tv shows. thats b.s. for the media to find a scapegoat.
Christmas wasn t a pagan holiday before rome made the holiday official in some standard as an insult to the pagan holiday that was on the date. there was a pagan religion that celebrated on that day. its not the same as Christmas being pagan I dont think.
text meabove to receive reward thanks for watching
no  no. go ahead.
either us gamers or trump . we re like the go to scape goats.
Im sorry  Im not normally a conspiracy oriented person  but  I was radicalized by gamer gate  sure sounds like something that a false flag would say.
it basically involves zoe quinn and anita sarkeesian drama and the exposure of unethical journalism but was the first woke war that lost. and the gamergate community chose literally a female character as thier visual representation. but here s a crash course https   youtu.be stl7-_f4_ea
I tell ya  these are quite some longshots these people are jumping to. I guarantee you they wouldn t make the same claims if something happens to a republican. smh
this just in  kevin who skipped me in the cafeteria line 20 years ago in 3rd grade to blame for pelosI attack.yes  Im still mad  you know what you did... kevin!
kotaku never blamed gamergate for the pelosI attack. the attacker himself  david depape  wrote in a blog post that he was introduced to far right ideologies thanks to gamergate. the attack himself said this  kotaku was simply relaying the information. get it right  the details are important for context.
thank you kotaku for reminding us why youre totally irrelevant.
fewer and fewer people are getting swayed buy these kinds of articles. people are smarter then the media seems to think they are.
gamergate has nothing to do with  far-right it was a bunch of people calling out videogame journalists for being biased cos they gave positive reviews to ensure they kept access.  all started when a female videogame maker was caught sleeping with a journalist.
he got hammered  so he s very immature for an old man...I ll see myself out
let s not forget how everyone dogpilled onto gg and turned it into a left vs right political war  and the gaming industry managed to largely escape their destiny with the figurative gallows by telling everyone they were super dedicated to not be shady anymore with each other. of course  no one really believed them but that was about all you could do with the situation  is tell your audience and customers that yourecognize having violated their trust and will do better. then it was largely forgotten about as the left right war waged on. gamers complained about the jacking of their cause but were shat on by the bunch turning it into a war against sjws. we were made fun of. we were made to feel like lowbie nags for being bothered that we had been ripped off for decades. by both sides of that war. we were told this was bigger than us  and to stfu with our lame cause. every time we bought a shitty game because a magazine told us it was amazin . we finally learned why  and we got shoved aside by all the public figures getting involved to catch the spot light. but I digress. we all moved on from those days except left wing media and figures. I just feel it is important to remind people how gamergate started  and then what it became. left media wants to paint it all the same from start to finish  and thats some bull.we all know those same gaming companies to this day dish out free product to reviewers and public figures. if you dont give favorable content towards game makers and publishers they will probably black list you to some kind of an extent  much like how things work in politics if you ask hard questions youre gonna be put in the backburner for future opportunities to ask questions. this is why the rise of influencers happened. even if you get a bad take on your free shit  youre still gonna send them more free shit because of your audience mass. I for one welcome our new overLords. may they rule in place of gaming media for ten thousand years.
further proof that kotaku is not  and never has been  for geeks and otaku.
even thought the attacker was a left wing nudist  the media is blaming gamers and the right.gas lighting at its finest.
well at least marilyn manson is happy he s not instantly blamed for all the shit american people do everyday in last couple of years.
I cant wait until kotaku and polygon shut down. Im going to throw the biggest party.
the whole story about the attack get stranger and stranger as it goes on
3 different police reports have been reported on all 3 different. 1 a unnamed person opened the door for the police and the police saw 2 men in their underwear fighting over a hammer. 2 the police broke in and saw 2 men fighting both with hammers. 3 paul opened the door for the police then went back and fought a man with the hammer. just put out the videos! I dont think any videos will be put out at all. if you look at his background and listen to his neighbors he was far left not right.
lmaooo gamers are always the scapegoat
I remember years ago castle wolfenstein 3d  released in 1992  that is about taking down world war two nazis was blamed for public violence  and this is nonsense and bizarre to accuse.
the s.f. story is full of holes that need to be filled. everyone stay safe.
they can always go old school and blame dungeons and dragons.
@james goodman  lol I didn t even think of that  next on the hit list.
@randomninja  thats for sure  yep continuing the fake narrative which hardly anyone pays attention to  Im just surprised this guy missed nancy.
dont forget about jade redmond and that cartoon of her
@zan jayna  true. there was alot of woke people. I think there was even a  notyourshield  movement as well before it became gamergate. gamers of all types came out and said to gamedevs and journalists no. you dont get to speak for us. and because it failed miserably  the woke fled to other areas while still trying to jab at gamers. Imean what do you think would happen  we been persecuted by everyone for decades. we dont care.
@william jenkins  if they wonthey wouldn t be talking about itstill 10 years later. since then indie games have gotten more sales  Im an indie dev myself   and then there s  elden ring. Ive observed whatever game journalists say is bad the market ignores and buys. doesnt mean they dont keep trying
@lavistro  I feel like gamers perscution complex is kind of the problem. and people here act like there is no issue with gamers  even though as a gamer myself and Ive been to so many fandoms and hell Ive been toxic myself at times. I cantell everyone 100  that like any other group hell more than some to be fair gaming has a lot of crazy people  with a lot of obsessions  a lot of radicalizing  a lot of bullcrap. and people just tell everyone to get thicker skin of course but when they start whining about wokeness no one can say that because why not  its honestly one of the more hateful fandoms and I dont think people like to say that enough.
@chandler burse    I agree. dont get me wrong. we always get blamed. I dont recall a day in my life where I wasn t persecuted as a gamer. in the prohibition era arcade was blamed.  a time and money waster . pinball wasn t unbanned until the 70s and the ban only encouraged racketeering and bribes.then it was death race in 70s and custard s revenge in the 80s despite any evidence it encouraged certain themes.then after the video game crash of 84 no company would sell the nes so nintendo markets it as toys. now people think that video games are a money and time waster for children and your not a man if you play games as an adult. despite the studies thatshow the opposite is true of games and adults played games like pac man and pong prior.Imean the military is one of the most masculine jobs you can get. we play games. infact my ptsd therapy through the va consists of playing games to mitigate symptoms. I was one of the first test subjects in rhier study.mk was almost banned  gta san andreas  despite being a mod  ect. mostly it was political boomers on both sides.which is why its hard to threaten gamers. we are always persecuted and yet loyal to the games we play. this is why they failed at gamergate. gamers didn t bend a knee. we said and continue to say no.gamers welcome everyone but gatekeep the game lore harder. as for toxic  depends. Imean I dont play league of legends because the gamers there dont play for fun. they play for the mlg tourneys. some are toxic some is just smack talk. its gamer 101 and the reason why we have tough skin. then there s the is ulfric a racist or suffering ptsd lore debate in elder scrolls   lara croft  ect. these are gatekeeping hardly toxic.gamers will always get the blame for years to come. until the last boomer dies out. by then more gamers will be prominent like in the 1800s. the crusaders used to play chess and pip with saracens in times of peace. pip was brought to europe and broke into two games. 1 had numbers for nobles which became the basis of cards today. the other had images for the peasants. when nobles didn t get thier money from peasants they banned it but itstill persisted in gypsy camps under the pretense of talking to God as divination. tarot. so the church ignored it and nobles had an issue with gypsies with gambling rings. but later games were no longer outlawed againits a historic cycle. one gamers be it cards  board games  arcade  or video  are no stranger to. its just more prominent now and common.
I agree  while I dont like the left or the right  Im a center person  but the media saying that its gamergate s fault is getting tiresome.
kotaku are game journalist s yet hate gamers. make it make sense. gaming has nothing to do with politics unless you are playing dragon age . and please melonie if you see this  Im begging you please play dragon age inquisition  would love to see your playthrough. they aren t enough hot women streaming the game.
I always love how me  a left-leaning independent  is far right because I supported looking at the lack of ethics in journalism. which exist to this day by the way.
be careful with the rabbit hole missy.
couple of things....1.  gamer gate was due to a female dev creating a terrible game  but her boyfriend guy she slept with  wrote a high review of the game.  when this was called out  the dev cried sexism and so others came to her defense.2.  this is a common ploy of the lying side .... they know that gamergate was about  but will still bring it up and repeat the same lies as if they are the truth.3.  the reason to make the comparison is to help spread the attack to a wider audience.  they know that by using gamer gate it will reach those not following main stream media. boom... truth bombs.
big ups mm
this is why kotaku is dying
kotaku are just dogs that bark at the moon just because its there in the sky. just ignore what they think they have to say.basically  gamergate started when a pos radical feminist slept around with a bunch of men and it turned out most  if not all  of them were in games media in some way. this resulted in an off-topic mention at the bottom of an article for the game of said radical feminist  this part appears blown out of proportion where it was said the game was given preferential treatment and positivity . people mostly found out from a testimonial one of the men wrote and published online  spurring everyone to talk of nepotism and bias in games journalism. games media hated that this was found out  since it turned out this happened  a lot   thus they wrote article after article about how gamers were misogynists  the  gamer  is dead  and other negative  unfounded nonsense about their own audiences to drown out the talk of the actual biases and other issues within games media. kotaku was one of the main  outspoken outlets on this when it happened.gamergate is just a dogwhistle kotaku and others use when they either want attention  or to blame  gamergaters  for something  or when they want to blame someone for something they want to win social score on.
donald trump  its fiiine they blame me for everything
gamergate was about ethics and transparency in journalism. the conversation didn t get any traction until a reviewer got caught showing favoritism to a developer that he was banging. shortly thereafter brianna wu and gaming s favorite con artist inserted themselves into the controversy for personal gain  turning it into the toxic shitshow that it became by insulting the people within the movement and crying out for help and donations when they inevitably retaliated.now its just used as a talking point by dogshit publications like kotaku whenever they need a boogieman.
wasn t his blog created like 4 days ago
can someone summarize gamergate for me  I d rather the normal sane person community explain than try to dig through these websites trying to sift the truth vs lies.
the long story short of gamergate is this  a female game dev offered  services  in exchange for good reviews on her game and got caught. of course  the people who said  yeah  no  this isn t okay.  were labeled nazImisogynistic homophobes because there wasn t a way to actually defend those actions.
give me a brake.nice video  thanks for reminding me I hate reading
dont even recall the chick s name  but she was getting crowd funded  for a game she couldn t actually produce. to get as much support for a non-existent product  she slept with people that would in return  give her non product  a favorable review.this dude that  attacked  the pelosI residence  lived in a hippie commune  that has a blm sign on the window  and rainbow flags about. the dude in question  was trying to break out of their place  as evidenced by the glass on the ground outside their residence  not in.there was also  another dude that wasn t named involved  that answered the door for the police....weird narrative around this one.
I seriously dont get why gamers are always to blame for something. like we want to get off our asses.
gamer gate was about ethics in video games. female game journalist writing review for favors and it was a big conflict or interest. the lady then got hate for her bad practices and then it was shifted to males bad and blah blah blah.
gamergate was a female indy game dev sleeping with multiple journalists and getting positive reviews for a unknown bad game. gamer s pointed out that there is a conflict of interest. the anti-gamergate side focused on some ppl that were pro-gamergate acting badly  instead of focus on what the majority were saying. then gamergate kind of morphed into feminism attacking gaming and creeping into game development and gamers pushing back against that.essentially  gamergate can be summed up as gamers being gamers and feminism finding a new area to mess with and finding out that gamers werent having it. feminists should take a break from nerd culture and go harass the hip hop rap industry and find out what happens.
they re doing everything they canto deflect from the truth. her husband was in a argument with his side piece who was very far left.the glass was broken outward to make it look like he broke in.. huge mistake on their end..
so gaming caused a green party  pride flag flying  illegal immigrant to do violence against the people who supposedly support their politics  yeah this whole story stinks to high heaven. why was paul sounding so friendly and unworried on the 9 11 call  how did he get out of the hospital the same day if it was that bad  why was paul and the perp both undressed  why is the media not addressing the attacker was an illegal
I blame gamers for the games that are coming out anymore.
it was also to do with how jade redmond got a cush job at epic games based on her prettiness and then she acted like she was king shit of dung hill.
well done
@zan jayna  indeed
not fast enough if you ask me.
agreed.yup
its a long story
paul even called david  a friend  on the 911 call. then the cops were making a  welfare check   not responding to any attack. unknown third male answered the door  both paul and friend in underwear. paul wasn t hit with the hammer until after cops were there. and who charges their phone in the bathroom !
@rockhopper_392  side piece was tired of having to hide their love  thats why he was asking  where s nancy
when someone is an extraordinarily unpopular person in the political landscape  or in this case they re outside of politics but still have political influence based on your connections   itshouldn t be a surprise if someone tries to hurt that person. definitely not saying paul deserved it  all violence  especially political violence  is objectively bad and I hope as a person he gets better soon  but......screwing over the people of your country repeatedly isn t going to make you very likeable yknow
its crazy that a bunch of stoners that prefer chilling and playing video games in solitude keep getting blamed and dragged into this governments political theater nonsense. secondly  how did smoking pot and playing video games become right wing
did the intruder also say  this is maga country   also  right before the midterms  coincidence
I always blame the catcher in the rye. no  I dont  its just a boring  depressing book populated by unlikeable characters  propped up by  elites  who force junior high classes to read it every year.
go boom! I love it.....
itsounds to me like pelosI s husband and another man had a sexual transaction and there was a fierce debate over the subject of  price paid for services rendered.  when the cops showed up  he claimed the guy broke in  stripped down to his underwear  and attacked him
paul pelosI wasn t just hammered.he was also getting nailed.
at least the new em twitter isn t allowing these conspiracy theories.
the article youread is an amusing piece of fiction.
a gaming site blamed gamers. makes sense.
gamergate is responsible for all the world s ills   sunspots.  early frosts.  aging.  bad movies.  cancer.  diet soda.  new coke.
a crazy homeless dude probably didnt play video games
so... I hear dwarf fortress is coming out on steam. cool  huh
lol melonie  youre so smart
doing everything they canto divert attention from themselves lol
how is that article not flagged for  misinformation
they need to grow up
I wish you were chief of all humans  3
tomb raider...blame it on laura!
uh oh -- you used the g-word at the end -- thats going to get you a lot of new heat  -
sounds to me like youre deaf then
text meabove to receive reward thanks for watching .
I thought gamergate was an attempt to stop one woman  anita sarkesian. hahaha!
people are so sensitive now
ah kotaku  yeah... I dont get it. kotaku and gamergate. it is always gamergate in their opinion. it is just silly!
we love tent free
you look so cuddly in that outfit.
we live in a society
video games are played by millions of people  for sure some people in those millions will be bad people  doesnt mean everyone else is. its like saying 100  of violent murderers and rapists drink water  and that means water is bad.
I stepped on a lego the other day. fucking gamergate...
is that a ren and stimpy hoodie    wtf!!!
what in the world is  gamer gate !
jajajaja death threats over bacon  sheesh
stop  hammer time
gamergate again  why are they so obsessed with it ! how many years have they been talking about this now  cant they just let it die along with their creativity and sense of reason
melonie they sargon shoeonhead chris raygun tj kirk mr metokour never harraseed woman they just criticized zoe quinn and anita sarkessian and called them out
those damn gamers again. when mass effect came out fox news said gamers will cause little girls to become strippers
gamergate shot jfk.
this is november 1st not april 1st
because new and politics cant blame themselves for the problems
time   lol
wow  dregging up gamergate  how desperate must they be to go back to that dried up well
11 10 jajajaja I never even once heard u disrespect anyone. ppl like those probably are narcissistic that think their being disrespected I guess idk shiiish
I wonder if they ll ever realize how ridiculous they sound.
plz melonie you got tatts some ppl be mad at that!
hmmm.... if only kotaku had any credibility
they need to blame someone else the trump stuff was a joke. next in line gamers or guns. 2a all the way let s go brandon fjb
I heard stalin was a big hoi4 fan.
of course kotaku full of lies
so an lgbtqia   professional nude activist  who graduated from berkeley and was living in a school bus was a right winger gamer gater
someones gotta say it. mmmmm...bacon!
they did the hokey pokey and some hanky panky. they both got stinky winkies.
way to throw in a little 2a at the very end
what game is it thatshows someone how to gain entry into the 3rd most powerful person in th u.s. in their underwear with nothing but a hammer without getting caught.
5 41 at least they admit that feminist was infiltrating the game industry haha
kotaku  just stop lol. they are desperate to be relevant again. also the fbI investigated these claims of harassment and death threats and none of them were credible.
why  at 2 40  did you pretend you cant pronounce qanon then at 11 45 you pronounced it perfectly and used it correctly in a sentence which is it
can I use the bacon tweet
this is like saying  man wore shoes  so radical shoe culture made him a murderer  so dumb
they are absolute degenerates .
oh my..
1. she has 10ft tall walls and gate  we saw this footage when the immigrants were dropped off 2. she has around the clock security guards3. she has 24hr surveillance4. house alarm5. shatter resistant glass  somehow shattered outward 6. the so called assailant  let pelosI walk around his house 7. also the man was in his underwear  nooooooone saw him walking down the street like this 8. can we talk to the suspect  interview him before he mysteriously dies by suicide in a room thats has nothing but a padded mat on it!9. an the actual medical reportcome on... come on
sadly Im not surprised
um wait dI they just describe the far left in that article
dude was a communist. like literally lived in an art commune
its all because of new call of duty game.
has anyone seen all the pride flags on mw2   so dumb
why wouldn t it be real
ahahahahaha
as a straight white male I guess I can add gamer to my list of thing that makes me a bad person.... yay
love you
pepe_love
dude was in his underwear. why are people even talking about this  either paul pelosI was in the middle of a lover s quarrel or the dude was off his rocker. all that needs to be said.
so studies have shown that when compared to nongame s the gamers have better hand eye coordination  better planning and puzzle solving skills  not a surprise after all its what games teach you to do  and are on the whole better at strategic thinking.when you look at the above one thing becomes clear  that the attack wasnt done by a gamer as they would have been smart enough to realise that it would never work but if it was a gamer they would have had a much better plan but much more importantly we gamers have better things to be doing with our time like playing games  just so its clear this paragraph was a joke! well apart from the bit about playing games  some gamers will forget to eat because they want just one more turn of civ6 then suddenly the sun is coming up and you are wondering why you haven t gone bed yet but another way you cantell this has nothing to do with gamers is most gamers dont have the time we have daily s to do.
must be nice to be a girl and get likes for posting bacon...  dude chill  maybe its because everyone loves bacon   duh.
not to mention that the perpetrator is anything but a conservative
it was staged.
the question remains  who puts random none related stuff for topic that is not related
gees!! first republicans and now hammers ! !  so this is what democrats mean when they say  dont let a tragedy go to waste
getting so tired of the media gaslighting. the only thing that makes sense is the gay lover thing  anything else is a stretch. this is how stupid the people running the media think the average person is. kotaku has been blaming gamergate for like ten years for everything.
been a metalhead since the 80 s. welcome to the club. its obviously ridiculous.
when did I become an all powerful God  I want to know. I also want to know how to use these powers for something other than propaganda.
kotaku is a bad joke.
why do people gotta blame gamers for everyting   simple  because they know gaming is an outlet to try and ignore the world  an escape from all the political nonsense and gives you the ability to be the hero of a story. all these things keep you from being keyed in 24 7 into the political climate. this cannot be allowed because you must be political and you must support the woke and if you dont we ll force woke stuff into all your outlets be it games or movies until they are no longer fun because fun is also not allowed while these injustices that dont exist are commited by nobody except us the woke
how dare you post bacon!
the attacker was registered green party
leave it to a picture of bacon to make the wokies squeal. suwey!
this what it is gamers are the most discriminate group
it was an illegal alien supposedly.   so it must be all gamers fault.
gamer gate it was gamer gate  nobody talks like that  this is a load of crap!
what does kotaku have to do with politics they are just reaching for click bait.
is this the moment when we get to call them bigots
is it bc election day coming up
blame the movies  blame video games  blame music  blame this or blame that  call people names but never place the blame where it belongs  on the nutcase that pulled the trigger or in this case swung the hammer. thats one of the far left s preferred tactics  blame whatever or whoever but never mention personal accountability. its always been something that they avoid like the plague.
do people actually read kotaku
melonie mac go boom  you play world of warships
its all a joke
3 dudes inside when police arrived. all in there underwear. no break in. the hammering happened after the police arrived  hence the window being broke from the inside out. nothing out of the ordinary for san fran which is maga country... lmfao
gamergate      jebus people still hung up on that  thats like blaming it on the towers dropping at this stage.

Im neutral when it comes to politics  but
gamergate.... they do realize that if  gamers stop buying video games and look for a new hobby  that these so called gamer journalist will be out of a job. right  hey I welcome the video game crash part 2. if it means no more trying to be use for political the better. the best video games where made  when gaming wasn t main stream. why else is there retro console minI of nes  snes  sega genesis  playstation  and turbograx 16  because those consoles are the golden age of new ideas and making new world wide brand. I love the fact they are shock that elon is firing twitter staff. they lost the company a lot of money by banning to much people. what else they thought was going to happen  they get to keep their jobs
hamburger
I dont understand... why would you post pictures of kevin bacon  and why would he threaten you over them
gamergate.... far-right  and is the guy even a big gamer
I grew up with duke nukem   never shot any pigs..
when shit hits the fan  blame the gamers. just look at the d d satanic panic of the early 80s. this has been an on going theme my entire life  and Im 39. for a while  it was music causing people to become violent. like  absolutely none of it makes sense. instead of looking into an issue further  just blame the games. its scapegoating bullshit over 9000 .
wasn t the guy a part of the green party  this is all politically motivated and kotaku just running defense for their own political views. they cant help themselves get these political jurnos out of gaming.
alt right  nonsense! wasn t it about crony journalism  some chick smashed out a journalists to get good marks over game! like really that whole gamer gate is tired now they need to move on! foh
damn its kinda scary how little you know of modern day politics!! is this how most of the country is    I fuckin hate politics personally  but I understand that they drastically effect my everyday life ya know
it is the gamers ....this tyme.... dookie love. the dirtiest game ever created. dirty pelossis !no....dirty sanchez.....
leftiod soy rage will only increase after the election haha
you post pictures of kevin bacon that get you death threats  what are you doing to this poor man in your pictures
the crazy man who attend paul plos was far left by his neighbors.
why  because blaming the right people or things doesnt get you views.
12 10 its a gay love affair  so getting hurt in thatsituation isn t something I totally disagree with!
do gamers even read kotaku  itseems like a site for sjws to talk about gamers rather than games.
kotaku is wack end of story
kotaku is the worst trash lol
classic deflection.
radicalised by gamergate   why stop there  claim depape was radicalised by that far-left icon  john wilkes booth!   its sarcasm  republicans.  sar-ca-sm!
the elites control everything and politicians are just their puppets  they just want us fighting like its a sports game
gamergate isn t a movement  its just the accusation that there s biased in video games against women.which isn t true just like the wage gap isn t true  its just a lot of false equivalency
kotaku is such trash how are they still running
its our fault paul got caught having a gay affair
watching the far right nutters loose it over this is so funny  ive seen stuff claiming it was a gay thing gone wrong  a 3rd mystery person lol even the old classic it was an antifa false flag op. lol its great theatre
wtf does gamergate have to do with paul pelosI s love affair
wait. Im a Christian. when the f did it become wrong for Christians to celebrate halloween
I am a south africa and this attack in my eyes is kinda karama.I have never heard of gamergate
gamers are the most oppressed race in history.
gamergate started ukraine tooand the attacker was living in a group of lgbt activists and blm.... totally right wing.
the kind of inane hateful garbage that flows out of people who still bring up gamergate in a negative light have removed any doubt about who the  villains  were at the time. gamergate blew up because journos were running cover for a hardcore serial abuser female  dev  they were sleeping with. nothing could be less progressive  these people were always scumbags. the violence they re talking about is cyberviolence  they cried to the un about it but their references were people like jack thompson the  games cause murder  idiot from the 90s. backing that clique in the industry was popular for a while but in my opinion all those people who leaned into it just showed their hands as frauds.
I blame illegals he wasn t supposed to be here
this is the most unfocused rambling video Ive ever watched.  all that was left to talk about was the midterm elections and you could have collected them all.
sorry  melanie  but if you dont even know what qanon is  you shouldn t be talking about this subject. stick to television shows.
yeah  totally us who killed her gay husband.
it was a gay lovers spat.
that dude was his gay lover.  there was no break in
pelosI this woman really has nothing better to do doesnt she  she really needs 2 retire asap
this whole story is sus to begin with. the lengths these politicians will go to to cover up their depraved behaviours is just hilarious. dude was clearly there for some kind of sausage-love session. the  attacker  is clearly a lefty... so  of course  kotaku jumps to their defence.
he s not a republican.
trump 2024. thanks
canadians are a shifty breed .... dont believe that they re all nice business.
@todd taylor   I dont believe it all but if they want to come in to california I have a drawer for a hammers they can have
awww  how cute  you tried to have a thought
stop projecting your lust for men on other people.
