I honestly think youre selling yourself short when it comes to movie reviews.  I really liked your review of morbius. I thought you expressed what was wrong with the film  and what the filmmakers could ve done to improve it  very well.
the original Godzilla movie  1954  still holds up as an awesome classic monster movie  tense  dark  lots of scary build up before you know exactly what youre dealing with  and a well-produced movie overall for the time. if anyone still hasn t seen it  youre missing out.
my favorite part of the chanell is that you are clearly honest and genuine you can watch your videos from 10 years ago and you as a person haven t changed which would be impossible if you were putting on a mask or grifting like so many others
you sold your part of our french vineyard to the russians   - brad pitt probably. if this isn t a prime example of first world problems then I dont know what could be.
I thought disposition of the vineyard would have been covered in family court during the divorce proceedings   hopefully they wont need to  go through the spectacle of a public trial  that could be really tough on their kids.  I loved angelina jolie s portrayal of lara croft  and hope developers will bring that kind of attitude and sass back in future tomb raider games.
there s something wrong with people these days that they just want to hear what they want to hear then when something happens that they dont like they act all emotional about it.
as someone who was a brat growing up  I tell my parents now they should have spanked me a few times. growing up I knew the worse thing that would happen is that I would get grounded.
love the video. I agree  about some of the people I think we both follow some times go to the extreme  with their anti-woke point of view. there s time s I agree with them and other times Im like   what are you talking about  there was nothing wrong with that.  anyways  I think its great that your folks are planning to move out that way. I know you ve talked about being lonely. so  I hope they can get out there soon. oh  and hey  I join your prayer group on your discord. this week will be week three for me. Ive been praying for you all this time and now Im with a group of people praying for you. so  please dont get discouraged. you ve got a lot a people  who care about you  on your side. ok  Im going to end my rant. I hope you have a fun but restful weekend. later melonie.
love the channel. youre looking good  healthy and happy! you ve been one of my favorite youtubers for a decade now. keep up the good work and God bless!
my ex looks like angelina..unfortunately I dont look like brad pitt..lol but im so sick of all these ridiculously drawn out divorces and public airing of all their chaos. im glad jd won his case...but I need a break from dysfunctional relationships lolborn and raised in texas....we got whoppins too... they need to bring that back  its clear kids are completely undisciplined now lol
brad should never have ditched jennifer aniston.
my favorite part about this video was the hidden cat in the background. agreed that its messed up to see when divorces end up doing petty things. to each their own. just need to concentrate on the good that we can do. solid Bible quote on seeking tranquility to be delivered through adversity. I dig it. go boom.
nothing scared me more as a kid then when my mom said   wait until your father gets home!   because I knew a good whoopin  was in order.
its actually very weird when you talk about the russian involvement in his wine business would hurt it. I work in a bakery and we have a loaf that was called russian black bread but it was changed after the invasion to black poppyseed bread. minor thing to notice but stuff can get serious pretty quick about those kinds of things.
the divorce was filled right after she had her breasts removed which I honestly thought was the biggest reason. as to this case  I never bothered to follow up after seeing it and I still dont believe he has a case.
8 30 I wished they d make cloverfield sequels like the first one.  I like aliens and predators and stuff.  I especially like aliens that dont look like you can put an actor inside.11 35 note that rotten tomato scores must be inverted.15 25 when that fuzzy thing started moving in the background  that  made my day.
brad still at it with his ex-wife  man this is never ending.
I relate to what you say about her a few minutes in. yes you like her as lara croft but yourecognize she could be a little loony maybe  side note  I watched a video of her eating arachnids  so... . its how I feel about tom cruise. love top gun maverick and he puts in the work for his films and I respect him for that. I ll never get into scientology though.
yeah melonie  I understand being away from family and friends and not knowing that many people. I recently moved to arlington texas from riverside california in january. my work moved from ca. I dont know anyone and Imiss my family and friends as well!
miss mac  few youtubers  the quartering  rekieta law   tim pool  have gotten swatted recently. keep safe out there .  be a hard target for these crazies out there. sides  who else am I going to get news about lara croft.
my brother got the original japanese version a few years ago. we watched it and shin Godzilla a while back. its the first time I d seen the 54 version in a long while but it was even better than I remembered.
they had an agreement if she sold her half she got in the divorce she was supposed to sell to him  she broke the agreement
@dean firnatine  ooh thats not cool
@dean firnatine  she put a 40  stake into the venture when itstarted up  so she was already entitled to 40  in the first place..
@scott mcmahon  despite her signature on a document huh  research . do a little before you spout off ok
brad caused this mess by disrepecting angie.
I agree  its ridiculous.
@dean firnatine  she got a court order to sell her shares after trying to sell it to brad who screwed around so she got a judge to handle it at the end. smart move on her part
ill never understand the need to harm a kid to make it understand common sense. if you have to abuse   hit     whoop  ur kid then you do not deserve a kid. stop continuing this whole narrative of abuse disguised as discipline.
@chris grande  spankings are not to understand common sense...its to get their attention when they re told not to do something and do it anyway and they lack reasoning skills...its not abuse unless its done out of anger.
underworld was so awesome. Im 1000  with you on that. hell boy also excellent. Im with you on the living garbage fire movies still love tremors and starship troopers.
15 30 melonie say   Im too chronically online  and doggo gets up knowing its mission.
stay true to yourself always!
that is the weirdest acusation ever. brad most definetly suffered abuse  but that is not revenge. pull your life toghether and go to work  man.
so what youre saying is mr and mrs smith 2 is going to be delayed again
hImelonie  did you watch shin Godzilla  by evangelion s director  its pretty good  and a fresh take on the whole thing. he also did a new ultraman one.
I love the recent tiktok vid you made of Godzilla  and while I agree he s definitely got it going on  I think heiseI series Godzilla is by far the hottest. I love that he s an antI hero and obviously beefed up to the gills on steroids. the 91 Godzilla vs king ghidora is a masterpiece.
keep being yourself. its too easy to get sucked into an echo chamber where everyone has the same opinion.
this is pretty evil  even for her  lol. she could have chosen a number of other entities to sell her share  even though she lied and said she wouldn t   she went and almost literally put brad in bed with a russian oligarch. really fun to do business with  lucky brad! she s really a piece of work.
cool channel and you rock girl. new sub!
johnny depp has carved a path for getting even for a lot of men.
regarding the discussion around 10 00 please know that people are going to have pre-determined opinions on what they think your content will or should be before they watch consume it. thats not on you... thats on them for being presumptuous. you do you - I ll keep chilling
its mr. and mrs. smith round 2 just without them having sex at the end lmao
will you be doing the fnt dallas meet-up  hope you are and thatsomeone is streaming it for those of us stuck beyond the wall in new england
hey melonie I just want to say that I think brad pitt should never have sued angie jolie for business money purpose and he would have spilt his share of money business with her and be done with it and left it alone and move on with their lives and take care of their kids too  ok melonie. anyway thats what brad pitt should have done   let it go and move on with his and her lives  ok melonie. anyway thats what I wanted to say bout your video for today  ok melonie. anyway hope you have a wonderful   great blessed day   evening at home with your pets   hope you have a good night too melonie.
I feel like brad is kind of sullying the significant victory that depp scored kind of like amber sullied me too and believe all women
I cantotally understand when people say they have   superhero fatigue   but Im still not there yet. most of the movies are at least decent and fun  and we get to watch incredible characters blow stuff up. what s not to like  in addition  there s nothing wrong with liking some objectively bad movies. I really enjoy the transformer movies and snyder s dc movies. sue me. p.s. kate beckinsale became my queen because of  underworld.  great movie!
good good
the first underworld movie was fantastic. I still have a movie poster of that hanging up all these years later. the sequels were meh.
hImelonie.  love your attitude!
let the hate flow through you.
unlimited powahhhh!!!
spanking is either hitting a kid entirely dependent on you to survive that has no idea why you are doing that or is old enough to understand why and therefore can actually be reasoned without resorting to violence. your choice.
the underworld movies are fun so are the hellboy movies didn t see the remake
alright that did it. we re going to the wine tasting festival.
hollywood actor and un humanitarian angelina jolie made a surprise visit to the western ukrainian city of lviv on saturday  the lviv regional governor said on telegram.according to maksym kozytskiy  jolie   who has been a unhcr special envoy for refugees since 2011   had come to speak to displaced people who have found refuge in lviv  including children undergoing treatment for injuries sustained in the missile strike on the kramatorsk railway station in early april.the attack in the eastern ukrainian city appeared to deliberately target a crowd of mostly women and children trying to flee a looming russian offensive  killing at least 52 and wounding dozens more.
maybe we cant keep this sort of thing going indefinitely. combine it with a lottery. winner takes all.
I want more fallout games  I know this has nothing at all to do with the video topic but this is my comment to tempt the algorithm
people need bring the spankings back. hell  even in illinois cps guidelines literally state thatspanking within reason- that doesnt leave marks and bruises- is fine. in illinois.
we already know some people will be triggered if told the wind blows.
I subscribed to melonie mac go boom with the full intention of just being your regular  quietly admiring in the background  simp... but then she said monster movies are her all-time favorite  so now I feel compelled to offer to take her fair tattooed hand in marriage. marry a monster girl  guys. together forever  you will happily  if somewhat morbidly  watch puny skyscrapers  overwhelmed military arsenals  and atomic breath go boom.
critics are biased against  genre  films.
just say what you actually think. we need fewer people clinging to camps because thats what they re expected to believe. if people were more sincere in their perspectives  we probably wouldn t be having a culture war and we d be able to agree to disagree on issues.
I like definitions so here is mine for woke   woke  authoritarian progressive ideology focused on female and non-white issues to the point that they hate male and white issues.  I think a society should share the same definitions for words or they will crumble.  words are not evil or good and they sure as hell aren t violence.
I thought I cared. sorry  I was wrong. do give a danm. thanks for doing what you do all the same.
brad pitt built the wine business. it was divided equally due to utterly misandrist divorce laws. she was contractually obliged to sell her half to him if she sold. and he would have paid. but she sold to an oligarch out of spite.
the sequel to the jd trial is coming up  starring marilyn manson.
respectfully the movie prey is very woke  whole tribe of comanche men get their ass kicked as does a large group of mountain men with .50 caliber muskets but the little girl beats a predator  your going to see them sued for an exact copy of a woke fan film  even the make up is exactly the same  only difference is the predator in the fan film was female  I have never seen a more obvious rip off.
I ll never understand why brad left jennifer for a weirdo who wore a vial of billy bob s blood.
I wouldn t want a divorce that would make me barf like for years..I d just die in a world of puke one marriage for me and just keep working on it
the underworld movie series is the best vampire vs werewolf movies there is.
I love to see it I didn t like any of them. angelina is suing fbI 2004
1. she was cleared to sell her shares. 2. he s mad that his new partners found out that he s been embezzling the company money and are suing him for it. 3. he was raided by french courts for this. dont turn this about misandry because you actually sound like a wokist. brad pitt is doing everything to make sure the general public forgets about him also getting sued for his faulty hurricane katrina homes  the judge who was dismissed because he was friends with brad  and the 3 children that wanted to testify against him in court.
@venI vidI vici  hello angelina
@willson tavarez  for saying facts
@cory hawley  women dont go by facts  they go by emotion
@willson tavarez  are you seriously discounting factual information because you dislike women thats a weird thing to do since either way facts are facts he tried to trap her in a business she never wanted thats his problem
@willson tavarez  dude there are court documents about the wine business  she tried to sell it to brad but brad was on some other crap so she got a judge to handle it  end of story.
@rikariegaming  cry me a river
wasn t that her brother s blood or am I remembering that wrong
@max  no it was billy bob s blood
I will never understand why anyone cares.
why is angelina a  weirdo   is there somethin I dont know or and didn t brad abuse his adopted child in public  wasn t that the reason they divorced
@serp derp  1st nobody is talking about what may or may not have been the reason brad and the weirdo divorced. 2nd how am I not supposed to insult your intelligence when you ask why she s a weirdo  I gave the exact reason why in my post. but I ll go one step further and add that anyone who shoves their tongue down their siblings throat is a weirdo.
this is what we need to quell the fears of all the people that think depp just set back all women.  they are two very different situations and no one is going to stand with pitt on this one.  though  jolie wont gain from it either.  the only victim between the two of them are the kids.  just because you can afford to adopt doesnt mean you should get to.
I was spanked as a kid and will probably my kids
I think now all these dumb celebrities will be suing just to get in the spot light again. she sold her share. if they re separated she doesnt have to answer to him. accept it and move on. how much money and land does brad own  talk about spoiled and controlling.
melonie is the best!
Im about to move to texas just to be friends with melonie lol really Im dieing to leave nyc just dont k own where I want to move to yet
mr and mrs smith  2
talking about video games and films why dont you do a video on your top games and films and why you like them
another distraction to ignore whats happening in the world
melonie daoc have been fun
nice!
yo! a two for one Bible verse of the day video!!!  d  d  d
just realized  nice hair style
@melonie mac go boom     maybe this is actually just a setup for a sequel motion picture  mr.   mrs. smith ii
I cant stand either of those two.
tragic relationships
to be honest  I dont care about this one.
have you tried the new fire emblem warriors demo
hey have you heard about actman vs quantum tv drama
what s up mel
get michael franzese s wine  former and reformed colombo crime family of nyc
I definitely agree. however this does set women back  because people only look at one side of this trial thinking depp is completely innocent when thats not the case. he sued her for speaking up about her abuse  even if it was all a lie. he sued her for that article  he wonthe trial because the jury decided his career was damaged by her article. he did not win the trial because he s innocent. its been disturbing to see so many men and women rush to be 100  on johnnys side and channel all their hate to amber when in reality they are clearly both abusers and depp is a misogynist and terrible person  just like her . people who actually look deeper into this case will realize that depp is also an abuser  and that nobody won in this trial. the extreme hate towards amber tho is what will cause a domino effect in the future and effect future victims  she was literally used as a tool for some men to channel all their misogyny and hate into  and for men and women to believe that they re siding with an innocent man.
thank you!

his testimony is powerful.
jolie invested 40  into the venture in the first place. she can do what the fuck she likes with her share of the business  the russian guy obviously made a better offer.  why shouldn t she profit
looks like nathan drake vs lara croft court edition
73 24
woke aside   black adam or an art film  Im sorry but hollywood can not write a role for a human soul  woke aside  sorry.
you mean to say that even infamous tomboy melonie mac has a weakness  and its terrible movies wow.
still team aniston. you fucked up  brad
not a fan of angelina s rbf.
she did something very malicious. and she did business with a russian billionaire. who notoriously kicks people out. perception is reality
I would definitely take melonie mac on a date. I don  t mind the Bible verses on youre videos.
angelina jolie can sell to whoever she wants  brad is just being woke
you went too extreme with it. you make me sick to my stomach
I go dislike when you go boom
do you have an issue with russians
why is it russians are always boogeymen
@kingslayer  did I say something wrong
shoulda stayed at cluckin  bell. lol
