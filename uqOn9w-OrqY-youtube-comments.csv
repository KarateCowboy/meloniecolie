at this rate with the evolution of lara croft her next form is going to be a minecraft creeper. they dont want women like you to have someone to look up to. they want you to be miserable like they are.
I cant believe people think being sexy is a crime... classic lara will always be my favorite!
man  you gotta love the 90 s. it was at the time everyone was in love with lara croft. men want to see more of her and women want to be her... everyone wins!!! classic lara is iconic however you look at it.
anyone accusing lara croft of misogony has clearly never played any of the games  and therefore their opinion is completely irrelevant.  I struggle to find a better example of a strong woman anywhere  real or imagined.
it genuinely saddens me when a game movie studio so blatantly misunderstands such an iconic character.  if even a child can work out that a square doesnt fit in a circle hole  why cant these studios    if they want to create a character a certain way  then fine  create a new character entirely and stop b stardising classic characters.
Im so damn tired of the  realistic and relatable  justification nonsense. lara was never meant to be this realistic  girl you see next door type of character. she s always been a fantasy character. which is fine. not everything in gaming always has to be about  being realistic  or  trying to relate to a character  sometimes you just want to play as someone or something you dont see in real life. sometimes you just want to be an italian plumber jumping on a goomba. sometimes you just want to be a space marine shooting up the forces of hell. and sometimes you just want to be a sexy  athletic  confident badass adventurer battling exotic creatures and mythical beings while exploring lost civilizations. and there s nothing wrong with that. its what made her and tomb raider fun to begin with.just further demonstrates how much crystal dynamics do not understand what the lara croft character is supposed to be. and have ironically made her weaker and less independent than the so called sexist version she s meant to replace.
melonie  I never would have thought I d find someone else so obsessed with lara.what they re doing to her breaks my heart. the impact tr and specifically lara has had on me growing up is absurd. I grew up loving history and wanting to be a fricking archeologist because of her. I saw myself in her.  I was very athletic and a tomboy  and would get bullied all the time but seeing her helped me appreciate myself more. I looked up to what she was. a strong  smart  woman who is not afraid to show her true self. nothing about her seemed sexual in any sort of way. in fact  everyone who played the game as a kid kept saying how tough and cool she was. hell  she was the reason I took on sports and later started grinding at the gym and ending up wining titles. she pushed me to study hard  hone all of my skills. and now  although Im ok with the new games  since they seem to have taken a more realistic approach  remember those 4m long jumps she used to do back in the day  lol   Im not ok with what they re trying to do. stop erasing her history. being naive I thought they de slowly move towards her true classic self  by giving us a different origin story  but finally ending with her transforming into the old lara. the one we grew up to love so much  but I see now she is getting the usual wokeyfing transformation everything else is.
I love that you ve made  boomer  a good thing. also Im pretty sick of people who cant decide if women can do what they want with their bodies or not. they are absolutely hypocrites.
there are many reasons why the woke hate the classic lara. here are some - a majority of men think she s great  since men are misogynists who feel that their masculinity is threatened by strong women  this must mean that lara isn t really a strong woman.- she s seen as a strong woman  if that is right  it means that the  90ies weren t the dark ages  and that the gender studies graduates of 2015 didn t actually revolutionize anything  but instead kicked in a bunch of open doors.- she appeals to women who want a female hero who is both feminine  and has traits that have been branded as  toxic masculinity . these are bad women  who probably tolerate  toxic masculinity  in men.- male action heroes with unrealistic bodies are proof of the patriarchy  while female action heroes with unrealistic bodies are proof of the patriarchy. I know. it doesnt make sense.- it undermines their gender ideology in several ways. it means the gender roles are wider than they claim  and that  non-binary  and similar terms therefore dont add anything new to the vocabulary. it means that both traditional femininity and and traditional masculinity are ok. it undermines their victim mentality  if picking yourself up and kicking ass is strength  then whining is weakness. also  it hurts their brains.
its super hypocritical of them to claim classic lara as a  sexist trope the amount of horn dogs who mod reboot tomb raider games with  sexy  outfits and make reboot lara p0rn currently now is far greater and far worse than the sexualized 90s advertisements   the fake nude code combined. that cheat code actually made lara explode as a punishment!
what doesnt sit right with me about reboot lara is her saviour complex - she always has to save everyone and not let anyone down and if she cant then she breaks down and loses all confidence. it made sense in the first one given she and her friends were trapped  but by shadow I felt like we weren t breaking any new ground at all with this so-called deeper characterisation. I dont mind reboot lara  but let s not pretend she has hundreds of layers of characterisation when the three reboot games cover the same aspects of her character over and over again. classic lara was the type who never tried to save everyone - because she knew such a feat was impossible. instead she focussed on what she could do and most importantly what she enjoyed. in last revelation she saved the world  sure  but it was mainly a by product of her confidently reversing her own screw-up.
imagine this happening with any other classic video game character. mrs pac-man s bow and lipstick were a sexist stereotype  so we improved her by removing them. now she looks exactly like pac-man  because progress.
why do I get the feeling that the people complaining about lara croft s sexiness are a bunch of blue haired land whales. also awesome cat melonie.
who s gonna remember this   ugh sadly thats so true about reboot lara  what s really sad is it feels like they dont know what a confident woman is because after that first reboot game came out didn t they say lara would find her confidence in the next one  it never felt like she had attitude or emotional strength even by shadow
Im so glad more and more people are starting to stand up to this crab because Ive had a problem with this shitsince the 2013 reboot. I want the real lara croft back!
there hasn t been a real tomb raider game in decades.  the first reboot by crystal dynamics rewrote the background of lara croft to make her seem more like batman.  the second reboot eliminated whatever ties existed to the original character altogether and actually made her batman.  arkham asylum envy I guess. the lara croft character was always male nerd fantasy  shapely  athletic  rich and  since her creator was a british nerd  aristocratic.  she s gone from being smart  sexy and well-adjusted to an obsessed wreck built like a teenage boy.  what a shame.  but hey  it just means I ll spend my money on other things.  the original games are always available on steam or gog after all.
classic lara croft was a badass she went toe to toe with men and won I absolutely adore classic lara croft she was everything the reboot doesnt hold a candle to her
a fun fact about how famous lara was  my parents moved up to derby  and there is a lara croft way where core s studio was and she has a star of fame in the city centre.
I never felt lara supposed to be  normal and relatable   she supposed to be the symbol  the superheroine  someone to look up too  and ideal  an icon. she always was strong  independent  very smart and heads above any male character in franchise  be they either strong buff dude or wealthy evil overLord. hells  even ancient egypt Gods were no match for her. I dont remember them even bringing up her being  sexy   hot  or  male pleaser  inside the games. yes  her outfits kinda lean into conventional hot and beauty standarts  but all I can say looking at them  yass kween slay   not the  omg what a walking mysogyny standart . and 2013 reboot lara is just some basic girl  who is called lara croft for some reason. honestly  characters like classic legend lara or bayonetta are examples for me of truly strong and independent women  who are not afraid of being themselves  not those  relatable girlies.
Im showing my age but I got into gaming when the best games were dos based. later on I got to play tomb raider and loved it. it was challenging but fun. so the wing commander  first two fallouts and tomb raider games were what I cut my teeth on. I kinda left gaming after borderl nds 2. Imay get back into it into games again but definitely retro games.
too many people have made mc creepers sexualized. lara s next form has been updated and will be a rock
they want you to be miserable like they are.  trufax
actually they just dont want to create something that uniquely appeals to males. thats their problem with attractive female characters.
the point is literally to destroy the fanbase of anything enjoyable in target societies.
@mayo rice  except those characters are often loved by females  so your point is moot.
@lee   men pretending to be women in sports is an intentional undermining of universal truth. the acceptance of the idea that men can be women and women can be men is the ultimate rejection of what is true. if they get society to accept such absurdities  they know they can get away with anything. truth will no longer have any value.  - ian smith
jabba the hutt would still be free for motion-capture  as woke-lara. maybe they could even fit him in some hot pants...as a nod to climate crisis....
lol I always thought of lara looking a bit like bakhar nabieva or some other fitness model. remember angelina jolie  I think it wasnt a good choice for her character  not strong or athletic at all  and I also thought the movie was bad... but at least she looked the part when compared to the laras we are getting today  who are skinny square planks looking sad and feeling sorry for existing  with magical plot armor instead of actual skills
she s a multiple felon.
why dont they just make a new game with a female lead that is acceptable to them  but let us have our classic lara.
it is a crime to the small hat mafia
the 90s were awesome. people were starting to really understand each other no matter sex or race or politics etc. people were speaking freely. the comedy was great. women were both really feminine and super kick ass in games movies like croft or trinity etc. the power of a feminine female who also kicks ass has been replaced with masculine females who easily throw 250lb men around with ease. its such a shame we ve actually regressed as a society since the 90s 2000s.
@a year in the life of anxiety joe 1 day at a time  I often think about that. because I feel that way about the 90s too. like things weren t perfect but it felt like peoples minds and hearts where in the right place and we were on the right track. and now its just go so far out of bounds I dont know what to think. but I was a kid in a small mountain town so maybe I dont really know what was going on back then.
this has always been my issue. there is no female character in gaming I canthink of that better personifies the phrase  needs no man . she is the closest thing to a female james bond... except without the sleeping around!
yeeeeeeeessss
@delvien vol  same with movies they re literally the reason we cant have nice things
besides which  the new lara croft is neither realistic nor relatable.  it isn t realistic to have her jump some of the distances she does without breaking bones.  making her batman isn t realistic in the slightest.  it isn t realistic to have her go toe-to-toe with trained male fighters twice her size and with more than twice her muscle mass and still win.  the original was more realistic in that regard.  thats why she had the guns.  and Ive never seen anything relatable about her obsessed  homicidally driven character.  sometimes her motivations contradict each other.  when she kills  when she doesnt  whom she trusts  or doesnt  or even choices thatset up the entire plotline of a game.  poor writing.  I ll take the classic era tomb raider anytime  as frustrating as itsometimes was.
I cant fly or use heat vision. superman is unrelatable. cancel him
they only use that excuse when it is convenient.
you just dont get it mate. lara s not supposed to be anything  she s what her creators want her to be. its not like she s a historical figure that they need to represent accurately. they re not trying to justify anything to you or anyone  they dont need to  this is a new take on her  and if you dont like it  thats your issue  not crystal s. they ve rebooted the franchise to appeal to new tastes  not close-minded nostalgics.the new tr s have sold much better than than the classics  so its quite obvious most people differ.
@astrius  and those new tr games started declining in sales. so clearly it hasn t worked out well for the long term like one would think.and Im not really interested in what the current developers think lara is supposed to be. Im only interested in the set in stone character she was supposed to be from the start. plus  its been like a decade of this bland origins story  weak  personality devoid version of lara. Im more than ready to move on from it.also  its not always a case of nostalgia. sometimes an older game is simply better plain and simple. people are always so quick to toss around that nostalgia argument  but hey its the truth. sometimes the older game is simply better than what came later.
@astrius  they sold well because its got better graphics and uncharted-like gameplay which is all normies require look at shills for games like the last of us part 2 fans hated it normies thought it was the bestest ever because  the gameplay was fun  meanwhile the actual fans that waited hand and foot for years watched their favorite game go up in flames and this insult of  you guys just need to move on and get with the new program  line is bs ppl aren t gonna go to a lesser product  for more money  just because its new and love it that logic makes no sense yet it keeps getting mindlessly repeated Im just wondering when you guys are going to stop ffs
@victor von doom  keep ranting and throwing all the classist rubbish you want  and hopelessly try to bring down what is at its peak using insults  that ll only prove that old-lara zealots aren t worth a penny  and re-enforce se s and cd s decision. really mate  thank you for your attitude. thanks to people like you  those of us who appreciate all three laras will get more games out of the latest iteration of her which  in my opinion  is the best.
@victor von doom  there you go again with classism. why does being a fan  for decades  make you more entitled to have a company appeal to your singular tastes  and why do you think others  are less worthy than you  why are you superior to those you call  normies   just because you liked tr before them  you think you are superior to uncharted fans things dont work like that  you are not any better than any other costumer. people who work on tr dont do it for free. they ll do what s best for the franchise. if more people like the new style  then they ll keep going. if this is  butchering  for you  thats your problem  and sorry to burst your bubble but nobody cares  and the more you insult people  the less likely they ll do. your money isn t worth more than others . for your information  I am also an old tr fan since 1996. Ive got my original tr psx disc from even before it went platinum. but that doesnt make me more entitled than anybody else.besides  do youreally think anybody from se or us fans of the new direction are going to read your aggressive rants insulting us and reconsider  like   yeah this bloke who is acting like a spoiled child  he knows better than me  Im going to abandonthis business direction that has proved to be so lucrative and has been praised by both fans and critiques and Im going to blindly follow his idea of returning to a style that almost killed the franchise and made eidos went bankrupt! lmao! keep dreaming
@astrius  what makes you more entitled is the fact your money and support is what kept the franchise going all those decades isn t that obvious     them crapping on the original character is basically crapping on the fans thatsupported the character for decades just to replace her with a new whiny version thats deemed acceptable if you wanna play whiny child lara more power to you I ll take classic badass lara anyday also its not my singular taste in about 10 years who dafaq is gonna remember reboot lara or the God awful alicia vikander movieno one  meanwhile classic lara and angelina are gonna continue living on
@victor von doom  and now that videogames are more expensive to create  they need to reach a broader audience. the money of that loud minority that you belong to  is not enough to keep tr alive. youre just salty that this game doesnt appeal to your tastes. let it go and find something else.on another note  I disagree with your view that classic lara was more badass. who s more badass  a character who had got superhuman strength and agility and had the whole game tailored to her  or someone who encounters great hardships yet endures and overcomes them life is not easy. the new lara croft suffers much but always keeps going and overcomes obstacles. all that without superhuman abilities and magical medipacks that appear in ruins dated from ancient milennia.its funny that you criticise tr for copying uncharted  when the latter has a protagonist that greatly resembles old lara in many ways. tr in fact improved uncharted concept by incorporating elements from the classics  exploration  item collecting  secrets  etc  and making the main character more important and vulnerable. but just keep fooling yourself boomer  youre good at it. sadly you wont fool anybody else.
@astrius  bro uncharted is based on the og tomb raider  which is partly why its so good  and youreally want me to answer  which is cooler the backflipping one of a kind dinosaur fighting dual pistol wielding badass or the whiny version of alloy that rips off nathan drake  despite the fact he ripped her off originally after she ripped off indiana jones  youreally think new lara compares even remotely to og lara seriously are you high and I guess you could call me a boomer I am on this channel am I not
@victor von doom  suit yourself mate. you can replay the classics as much as you want. sadly for you  reboot stays. have fun  p
@astrius  sounds like they just dont want a tr game. why dont they make a separate game with a whiny girl stripped of all charisma for people like you  than drastically alter already established characters and franchises. also  there s a reason why they want to unite old and new aesthetics now  because they clearly started to realise something.
@arch  seems to me they want a tr game alright  but modernised  you cant expect a franchise to be all the same for decades  the old formula already became stale which is why each tr sold worse until legend  and it happened again until tr2013. its actually the opposite  the main saga has evolved in the right direction  if anything  they should create a different brand that copies the old formula for people who cant move on like yourself  obviously for mobile gaming because an aaa game nowadays cant get away with what the originals had. I think new lara is more charismatic than the classic  you must be quite the fascist if you dont like a character because she shows weakness  which is a key aspect in character creation and development. the unification could have many different purposes and approaches  your interpretation will likely lead you to disappointment. do you think they re going to pay attention to haters  with tr u they listened to nostalgic  fans  and tried to go back to the old formula and they ended up being less succesful again. the money is on the broader audience that enjoys the new direction  not the loud minority of salty haters who will criticise anything they release.so yeah  good luck with that.
@astrius  oh wow  liking a power fantasy strong characters is now called fascism  good to know.   aaa game nowadays cant get away with what the originals had   that is a bullshit claim that is not backed with any statistics. just because 2008 tr u sold less than modern trs when gaming is more popular than movies  doesnt mean it happened because the old formula failed. the idea that power fantasy characters dont work in modern gaming is a myth fueled by deeply insecure people who want to see characters that look and function like they do. it is being debunked over and over with games like God of war  final fantasy  devil may cry etc. tr wasn t meant to be grounded and realistic. if they wanted a grittier version of uncharted than they should have made itso  without calling that game tomb raider. they still couldn t beat uncharted and now they are bringing back the old elements. their twitter is all about promotion of classic lara again.  so yeah  thank you for your wishes!
@arch  you missed my point. enjoying a power fantasy character isn t fascism. busting someone for showing weakness and calling them  whiny  is a fascist trait. lara being a mary sue is not the only thing that wouldn t work today. all the franchises you showed  except for dmc  feature flawed characters.tr wasn t meant to be realistic  of course not. but they ve changed direction. you just dont want the franchise to evolve  I do. I honestly dont think they re gonna  go back to how it was before  but youre free to expect otherwise. time will tell. I assure you  if classic lara returns  you wont see me throughout the whole internet being bitter and throwing hate like you classic lara zealots do.
@mark brooks classic lara was perfectly capable of knocking a man tail-over-teakettle with a stupidly high roundhouse kick in cutscenes  the lack of melee attack was a gameplay thing - melee was even planned but cut from the last revelation. so youre wrong there at least.  the guns are really because they re way cheaper than the magical blasty sticks.
with the last trilogy selling better than previous tr titles  I dont think classic lara is coming back in a big way.  saw sales figures in some fandom site.  the fans who make custom levels and unofficial remakes is our only hope. oh and maybe some mobile games.
@astrius  thankfully square enix sold both tomb raider and deus ex to another company who will probably return to both series classic roots.nostalgia is a very very powerful thing
@astrius  square enix aren t in charge anymore they sold their western studios to another company.the classic tomb raider needs to return along with the classic deus exreboots have become tiresome
@astrius  rumor has it they want to combine both classic timeline tomb raider and the reboot timeline tomb raider togetherwhich wouldn t make any sense whatsoever  how can reboot lara croft with a bow become classic lara croft with handguns
@astrius  nobody likes mobile gaming mate.do to all of the predatory microtransactions and poor gaming design due to being a mobile game
@astrius  the idea of a unification of both the classic tomb raider timeline and the reboot tomb raider timeline is quite frankly a very very bad idea and there are a lot of plot holes as a result of combining both. 1.  her backstory in the reboot contradicts everything about the classic backstory 2.  classic lara croft used handguns while reboot lara croft used a bow 3.  personality how did a whiny schoolgirl end up becoming the snarky badass in the classic timeline 4. jonah is a new character who was introduced and created specifically for the reboot but was nowhere to be seen in the classic games
@hikiko mori  update  square enix sold all of its western developers and western franchises like tomb raider  deus ex  legacy of kain  and marvel to a different company. odds are the new company will probably just reboot the reboots of deus ex and tomb raider to better fit the classics or they will probably just ignore and wont do anything with both franchises until the middle or end of this decade.
@naquin green  not sure why youre spamming me with stupid replies.   the reason why se sold the ip has got nothing to do with hate-pressuring from old fans  do your research.   you dont seem to understand what unification of timelines means.   we will see what the new company does with it  at this stage we can only guess  but obviously it wont be a sequel to aod and it certainly wont be the outdated core-era gameplay.  most probably yet another reboot  but if they re wise  it will be a sequel to the survivor trilogy  since its been the most profitable tr saga to this day  whether you like it or not. have fun ranting.
@astrius  why should there be a sequel to the survivor trilogy besides the trilogy being successful money-wise. the  outdated core-era gameplay combat  could be reimagined to fit both old and new fans if there is another reboot on the horizon reboot lara croft needs to be classic lara croft  fans miss the snarky take no nonsense badass who was always calm under pressure and was always in-control of the situation at hand and accepted that no matter what she cant save everyone and should only save the people she can  classic lara croft is loved by millions of fans worldwide.while the reboot lara croft has been criticized for the past 10 years now for being a whiny crybaby who gets beaten up and has a bunch of soap opera levels of pointless melodrama that adds nothing to her character besides making her look like an overly emotional idiot and she barely even has a personality besides generic  girl next door stereotype  seriously the lara croft played by alicia vikander from the tomb raider movie from 2017 was more accurate to the original games while the story of the film was based off the reboot  and at least that movie actually gave her iconic pistols unlike the survivor trilogy.
@naquin green  you talk too much.
she is not even that much out of reality. mrs olympia athletes have her figure and some even have her face structure.
@hikiko mori   selling better  we talk about a time were not everyone had a pc or a console at home and videogames grew out of the  just for kids phase  vs every normie playing games. who would buy a console just for a new tomb raider game nowadays
I used to think that the giblets were naked. thatshould have been what happened - then it would be a nude raider code.
I really dont mind the mods but it does show that people want sexy women in their games and not twitter potatoes. I doubt though that twitter people would admit that. I actually like those mos in various games. they are fun. putting cloud in a dress or the huge amount of clothing mods for anniversary.
@blackcroft666lp   twitter potatoes  xd
on rise that was one of the aspects that made me stop playing the game and just watch my husband play the rest. as I remember there was this village on the snowy mountains  the villagers were strong people living on hard mode  there are mentions of  coming of age rituals   fighting with bears  scavenging for food etc and youre telling me those folks cant defend themselves from the mercenaries and only unconfident and not that experienced lara croft can save them  please no.
dont forget that before the retcon  lara gave her life to undo thatscrewup - not because she was fine with dying  but because she screwed up her escape.that would have been the only time seeing lara cry would have been appropriate.
that was my main issue with reboot lara. she felt sorta bipolar in how her cutscene characterizations jarred with her comments and actions in gameplay  then there was that utter failure to actually learn the lesson that original lara had  of it being silly to try to save everyone and to take on guilt for things far outside your control. reboot lara was marketed as  lara becoming the badass you know and love   but then she never actually had any real character development in that direction  it was just constantly waffling back and forth over the same issues she fails to learn the lessons of. she never really took any steps in that direction. the first of the reboot games had the most progress on that front  but it felt sorta  too fast  and more like she was slipping in and out of mania and dissociation  often in a manner that didn t make sense with the situation.classic croft worked as a  fixed character  situation  precisely because she had  in most the games  already had most of her development in the  past  of the events the game covered.
@n  rodrigues  rumor has it they want to align both of the original and reboot timelines of tomb raider together which wouldn t make any sense imao.
@kopperneoman  rumor  they want to align both the original and reboot timelines of tomb raider together which wouldn t make any sense and would cause a lot of plot holes if done.
@jtnachos16  rumor they want to align both the classic and reboot timelines of tomb raider together which wouldn t make any sense whatsoever especially considering the massive differences between classic lara croft and reboot lara croft.
@jtnachos16  classic lara actually had to face harsh realities. the survival after the plain crash. getting thown out of her home and has to work to finance her life and adventures. court cases to get the croft manor  heritage from her aunt as far as iremember . a lot of critics and propably also slandering from rivals.not getting everything blown in the butt like crystal dynamics lara.
@asinisterkiid  also there are no more ghosts that chase you because that would be too hard for game journalists to play. pac-person just goes around eating everything to his her zur s desire.
what s funny is most of these people act like thats all classic lara was - sex appeal. she had a personality. more so than what the current version has. she cracked jokes. she displayed intellect. she had a badass aura of confidence. whereas the current portrayal is a storm of mope and mope harder and parental issues. and its also mostly done from the male protectionist standpoint. they forget plenty of tr female fans exist and many of them like classic lara s design.
many of them are. not all. but many.
what do you mean  feeling   I thought we hold these truths to be self evident
you guessed it right
she came across as really entitled in shadow.
because they aren t confident and have a daddy issue kink thatsomehow grew stronger and stronger itseems.
legend is dope
you can play the lara croft spinoff series.
@hrvoje grahovac  not as dope as the original. but yea I ll give it a 7 10
@hrvoje grahovac  legend isn t considered a real tomb raider game
@a.k. slim  at least its more interesting than tr2013
the legend trilogy changed a lot of what made tomb raider  well tomb raider. but lara was still the same character in my opinion and I think the gameplay and story is great.
@hrvoje grahovac  legend is horrible. not a tomb raider game.
@g d  says who
to be fair youre killing men that entire game.
I live in derbyshireat derby s silk mill  world s first factory  actually!   there s a tomb raider 1  ps1  game there  since its a museum now
@canis lupid  same   live a road away from lara croft way and when I found out I was so ecstatic ngl.
if you look at videos about mrs olympia athelets or bodybuilding you will see that her figure isn t even that unrealistic.
wing commander 1   2 were dope. my first win 3.1 486 pc that my uncle built came with those as well as x-wing  and a few others like commander keen  humans  and the like. and later I found sim city 2000... cant forget doom  wolfenstein  blake stone  duke nukem  diablo  command   conquer  warcraft  etc.
privateer was the first game that hooked me. I was the navy at the time and developing a libertarian veiw back in the mid 90s
hell yeah  core-era tomb raider! hell yeah  fallout 1 and 2!  if you came into either franchise with the later games  you have no idea what the bar is.
I only play old games  and watch old movies tv shows. I highly recommend it.    the modern entertainment industry really sucks. its just not worth your time.
the first games I got into were t-mek and descent. I never got into tombraider in the early years but I wasn t interested at that time as you can see with the above games. Imostly played strategy  rpg and vehicle combat games like twisted metal  vigilante 8  starwars demolition  battletanx  etc.however  I did play tomb raider 2 at a friend s and its pretty absurd to retcon one of the most iconic female characters in gaming.
I recommend trying out the classic point and click games.
mem  c ring a bell
wolfenstein
@brian k  the 92 classic that put fps on the map. with mods still rolling out.
play fromsoft. those games will bring you those old feelings.
lara was a gorgeous adorable superheroine. when reboot came out I was excited for a gritty origin story  but sighed with sadness when they turned her into a neurotic drip.
had a really bad day today  my first attempt at streaming went horribly wrong  this gave me a chuckle  the way you deliver news thatshould be upsetting but somehow make it funny and uplifting is amazing  never stop
its so terrible that people are like that. keep going melonie mac  you rule!
as a boy in the 90s I never played tomb raider  it was only women and girls that did... now I took interest in the series  because real life girls! they loved her and after playing the series gave me plenty to talk to them about. I hate how they changed laura in 2013 she was a whiny  weak and cowardly creature. in shadow she was all those but now has an attitude.note  thick thighs from the gym tend to lead to a nice butt. I work out all the time  attempting to loose 200 pounds is not fun. edit  youre one of the few that have the receipts to prove the hate they get.
thank you  thank you. classic lara is my childhood hero. she made me want to go on adventures  to get into history and to not follow social expectations just for the sake of it. its sad that all of her amazing sides are ignored and all the focus is shifted on how  sexist  her classic character allegedly is. thanks for pointing out what made classic lara great.
12 20 -  sigh the last revelation was actually my first tomb raider game  so I have quite fond memories of it and angkor wat tutorial level...and of course  werner von croy! pull the lever.  on your head be it. and it wasn t even the full version. it was trial disc  of sorts  but it let you play so much. it ended after you played senet and exited the tomb.I didn t get my hands on the full get until a several years later  which is just as well  that mechanical minotaur scared the shit out of me!jeez  I could go on and on about tomb raider iv!
21.6k already  holy cow you are rocking it!!! well done mel!!
I said this in another video of another youtuber and I ll say this again  classic lara is peak female game character. she does what she does because she wants to. she has no emotional motives like  daddy gone bye bye omg  to raid tombs  she just wants the artefact and she s gonna get it. she is smart  intelligent and has the physical abilities to do so alone. she answers to no one but herself and does t need a masculine figure to keep her story going. that is not a misogynistic  it is the exact opposite. she s powerful and her boobs dont take away any of that  just because she was sexualized by the media at the time it doesnt mean thatshe needs to be forgotten because  oh no misogyny . it pisses me off how we can have male characters totally op  insane muscles  good looking  super strong and no one bats an eye. Im talking kratos  snake  drake....so many characters and no one is up in arms talking about how  unrealistic that is and omg it will make boys feel inadequate . lara croft on the other hand is  too much    not realistic    the pressure on our poor girls . like  no mam  I deserve to have an aspirational character too! to aspire  to love  to admire! the new lara as the personality of a wet sock  Im a tr fan for years and played all games...I could t bring myself to finish rise and played a bit of shadow just because it was free on ps   that character is so lame and annoying.
dont let them guilt trip   gaslight you into not voicing your opinions  melanie. you keeping quiet is exactly what they want. the opinions that matter are the ones from those around you. not the opinions of online anons.
14 08 once yourealize that the woke is essentially guilty backlash  everything fits. crystal dynamics thought they had to go over the top in sexualization to sell lara croft game after the slump. they themselves had the misogynistic views about women. when they were called out on it by journos  their guilt response was over correction and trying to hide their past.
thank you for being strong and voicing your opinions  many people agree with you. every time someone like yourself uses their platform to talk about these issues  they inspire others to voice their true thoughts.  I love your videos  please keep up the good work  I believe youre making a difference  3
I agree with how weak 2013 lara is portrayed. I was actively irritated with it while playing tomb raider 2013. classic lara will be long remembered positively over her  modern  take.
why dont they make lara a man once for all  then  they re erasing all of her femininity  might as well make her a dude if thats what they want. repulsive tbh. Imiss the real lara
I love all the versions of tomb raider. its one of the few franchises that keeps being good even if its completely different each time. I dont mind changes  but I dont like throwing shade at where it came from. the classics are awesome and I dont think the reboots need to distance themselves from the og s. they stand on their own and have their own fan base. no reason to attack og fans who loved a wild crazy series with freaking t-rex s. honestly they should just reboot the series again and have two croft sisters. then we could have both classic era and modern era. they could be different people who just took different paths in life. I see both versions of lara as awesome  just let the fans have a little fun with the og characters crystal dynamics.
how did my cat get to your house   seriously - looks just like my cat.  anyway - my favorite look for lara in-game might be underworld anniversary legend because the graphics had finally caught up to the box art  mostly - but classic 1-6 lara is the one I grew up with.  the reboot lara is more cute than anything with her extra gold hoop in one ear and is more like a girl I would have dated in college that liked to go rock climbing on the weekend.
you should take a look at the version they used for final fantasy war of the visions. the art style is very well done and the illustration is beautiful! she s a bit more anime than you might be used to  but its one of the best versions Ive seen for a long time!
speak for us all! stay stronk! youre an amazing lady with a growing voice  on a platform that needs it!
in shadow they allowed us the option to  choose whatever clothing we wanted after the first playthrough due to area restrictions.  most fans including myself thought most shadow outfits were very unflattering on lara.
really good passage on this episode. Im grateful for the reminders. I love watching your channel and seeing your strength. I look forward to many more. God keep you
lara croft is a femme fatale and should stay that way not this woke version!!! why are they doing this to the fans just to please this woke culture!! sad day for gaming!! glad coletrain came out on your video today youreally fired shots today with restraint absolutely loved it.
I felt the same way. I got genuinely annoyed when reboot lara was whining on the radio asking dudes for help and support. I kept thinking  when do I get to play a badass rather than a victim
2013 lara was a reboot origin story. thus she was portrayed as weak and inexperienced in the field in order to show her character development in the game and in its sequels. I get that it is jarring for long time tr fans used to seeing an experienced and confident ass kicker for several years suddently seeing the character appear quite vulnerable.I disagree with melonie that reboot lara was just a crying people pleaser. lara never tried to please whitman  and she went against the wishes of roth at one point in order to rescue the pilot. nor was she interested in pleasing mathias at any point. as for her crying  that was an attempt to place some dramatic human realism into her character during her very first solo survival experience and her first kill which would likely be a very traumatic experience for anyone to have. but if players prefer the  ice queen  lara of the earlier series thats good for them. for me  I find the pre-2006 games rather cartoonish. though I still like the  legend  lara for the improved visuals and nostalgia. but I love the rotr the most as the best game sequel ever in the series.
@x_trio_3_po  yeah these og fans just doesnt understand that  though I agree that reboot lara and og lara is different from each other but not in a bad way
thats gonna be the  secret twist  in the next game. surprise! lara was a man from the very beginning and has now been the first trans character in gaming fooling everyone! take that patriarchy!
you mean nathan drake
then it would be a complete uncharted rip-off.
I liked the first reboot game because I never played the earlier ones to any significant degree  the mechanics were smooth and the character was believable even if they retconed her  which I didn t know at the time. however  the newer games never really grabbed my attention  she s just not that memorable in the new games.
@delvien vol  to each its own   I cantotally respect that it wasn t a amazing experience character wise for ya. Im a fan thatseems to have fallen in the cracks with only not loving 1 or 2 of the games. for me the new version was awesome   but so was the original versions of lara. to me they just made a han solo into a luke skywalker. its a different experience that isn t going to resonate with everyone  but for me the different versions have us a totally fantastic fantasy series. some leaning into the fun and badass action hero. the other just a human stuck against insurmountable odds. love them both  and I honestly love both the characters.  I do miss old lara  but I dont mind seeing them play outside the box a bit.
I dont know if they ve criticised classic lara but I sure as hell am sick of classic lara stans hating on the new lara all over the internet. like  mate  I get it  you dont like it  just dont play it  play the old ones. why do you spend so much energy trying to bring down something you wont be able to change
stronk
I have always loved lara croft not just because she was a beautiful curvy woman  but she has a strong personality  a smart historian   archeologist and like you said she had flaws..sometimes she push too much and got herself into some sticky situations....to me she was female indiana jones....most people love indiana jones...to me I know they are different generations but would be nice to see lara and indiana delve tombs together    also is it just me or could mel actually play lara..she has a lot of similarities
what bothers me is they seemed to tease a return to confident classic lara during the syria level in rise. I loved that mission. it was lara in a tank top  by herself  raiding a tomb  doing a puzzle  sassing the bad guy and using her intellect....only to....not be that ten minutes later  like  what  why cant we have syria lara  itseemed like a nice blend of classic and new in one. it felt like cd were trolling the fans there....
if Im not mistaken  would classic lara be somewhat similar to bayonetta with how lara was so acrobatic and had infinite ammo etc  I didn t have the privilege of owning and playing a full lara croft game but I remember playing a demo and was amazed at how athletic she was and fighting giant tigers  spiders etc  I feel like the game devs could look to bayonetta for inspiration on not having to be so  realistic  or in late cases androgynous
hey melonie!  3 I completely agree with you on this subject I was just thinking the other day how Imissed the classic lara I have gotten to play some of the core design games and imo they were so much better than the reboot I got annoyed a bit with the reboot games and had to stop playing for the combat reasons and just her feeling like a completely different character unrecognizable and such and had more fun with the older ones I also like the power fantasy female body types and saw nothing wrong with the way she looked before nothing at all and I had no idea they had bikinis in the crystal dynamics version until now and yeah...so much more sexualized and they are very hypocritical too  its honestly sad and stupid those people made those terrible comments twords you as well. as a artist myself I drew anime type artwork but with my own style to it and I get people complaining on how I draw girls I draw them to be more curvy and such so I know what you mean its upsetting they are catering more to the woke people I just wish we could get the old lara back prefer her over the cry baby in the new games xd at least there are some great fan projects out there like the tr2 remake and the traod remake. gives me some hope. im so over the woke bullshit. oh and I just subscribed
thank you melonie  you speak for a lot of us
thanks for making this video  difficult to discuss this on twitter without being flamed by disgruntled people using emoticons and animated gifs in the comments. I feel many americans dont really like the british or british things  maybe its a historical grudge thing  for example  they forced us to cancel the harrier jumpjet  first vertical take-off and landing fighter jet   then took the concept for themselves in the f35. they also bought out cadbury chocolate  something that was long-established and popular and now it feels cheap and horrible somehow. from what I understand  tomb raider is the most popular video game in the world  but this was probably even before square enix created the 2013 reboot series  but Imight add that their japanese owners have also had their cut of lara with final fantasy and their animes and not respected the character or the primary games. I really dont like this unattractive american  plain jane  version of lara  with the longbow and axe  the franchise became a mountain survivor tactical shooter game and blends in with many other existing games. they should take their character  rename her  rename their games and then pass the tomb raider ip onto a studio that can do the games the justice they deserve. one problem they have with mapping a real person s face onto a computer model is their in-game character then takes on the appearance of cancer and other chronic health problems like compressed spines  this makes her seem really average  ordinary and degenerate in my opinion. when she has all her gymnastic finesse  eloquence  confident personality and class that the classic lara possess   even the lau lara manages to maintain this with the character   this to me make her extraordinary  and an iconic role model  something that made her stand out  and she was sexy without being rude or sluty  which is what made me fall out with jonell elliot s depiction of her between games 4-6  but I think toby must have helped get things back on track from legend onwards. apparently  underworld wasn t even a completed game  so you can sort of seeing what could be achieved with the right people  vision and effort. another awesome game that was ruined with woke principles in character development was mass effect andromeda.
my biggest gripe with the reboot tr is that lara is constantly falling down something whereas classic lara is sure footed and athletic.
the fictional character who has had a huge impact on my life is goku  dragon ball franchise in general ... we all got a that one character  multiples even. I can remember being a kid and getting exposed to him for the first time back in 1998 during the first release of the saban dub episode  canadian dub to most of my generation ... my mind was blown  and was magical to say the least. I went from watching generic american super hero cartoons to this other worldly experience from across seas which at the time was so raw and new to me. that impact on my life alone has made everything dragon ball my  1 forever in thatsense. call it my nostalgia high. I hold on to nostalgia dearly as it helps me get through life  happier memories  etc. with tomb raider seemingly being yours I get it. its not cool at all to see your nostalgia high slowly being ruined killed like it has.
personally  I look at classic lara as what an action star is for females   geralt  witcher  and batman. these are characters who take time to develop their skills and body  to a point they become amazing. they re something we strive to be like  and though we may not be able to exactly look or be like them  its just that image that you can image that pushes you a little further.
I love the new lara and I feel so ashamed that there are some that call themselves fans that do what melonie mac is saying. just as I cant believe there are some cd developers thatsay that classic lara is made for the male gaze only.I love all versions of lara.
I loved the ninja turtles. and I was inspired by them. did I want them to look like me  heck no. I dont need my ninja turtles to be  realistic  or  relatable . same with he-man. I loved he-man as a kid. his muscles actually made me feel more powerful when I pretended to be him  I didn t want a wimp to look up to.
honestly  I think both tomb raider  angel of darkness  legend and underworld were the peaks for lara. aod simply because it was what introduced me to the series. with legend and underwold  while yes  she was following her fathers footsteps-with good reason imo-she ended up surpassing him  retrieving the excalibur  but wielding mjolnir for a brief moment of time.the only reason she followed her father into archeology  was to find out what happened to her mother. she succeeded where he father failed  and I love it. especially when the games show she had to learn a lot about the occult to even make it as far as she did.all in all  great video showing how lara s design history  and original motivations for becoming an archeologist originally. sometimes the best motivator is  I want to do this . it makes me want to play the original games. you ve earned a subscriber  congrats!
agree  with you. classic is the only lara croft I know and adored growing up. nothing good will come out from this franchise as long as crystal square are involved and own the rights.
from tr 1-6 the series was fkn sick af with aod being the true ending of the series.. the music  atmosphere  gameplay   brutally challenging difficulty was highly respected.. then it got weird   sappy from aod onwards to an even weirder woke cinematic walking simulator
classic lara is what I think of as my best gaming memories   part of my childhood. I sunk    into a portable game system with my personal library of games from my era. the first 5 and some might say only  tr titles were the first to put on this devise. I wanted to dig new lara but no go. it didnt stay true to lara as I knew her to be. so they can keep new lara. and ill be in the corner blissfully playing tr 1-5.
I think the biggest reason why your channel is getting so many subscribers is for one simple reason - you are saying what a lot of people are thinking. and Im also waiting for the day cole train either sticks his face in the camera or swats it.
this is nice. to be back from work  be called a boomer and spend my evening playing video games. keep it up
also the idea of a  more empowering lara croft  is almost sacrilegious to me and I dont use that word lightly  lara croft made me want to be the kind of man thatshe would want standing at her side she was always very sexy but she was unattainable she removed the need to try to get her because I never ever could she makes me want to be a better person still to this day.
classic lara will always be my favourite lara  I am open to the idea of alt timelines in tomb raider its about mythical creatures  tombs!  treasures  heck even a dagger that changes you into a feckin dragon  and so many other crazy stuff so yeah stay awesome everyone  3
excellent vod  mel! agreed with everything you said. I stopped supporting the franchise when the current reboot started. crystal dynamics and square enix do not deserve the franchise and itshould be sold. the best choices for ownership of the franchise are microsoft  ubisoft and capcom. sony and konamI would be the worst choices and sony would be just as bad as crystal dynamics and square enix  maybe even worse. also  my cat was on my lap while watching this vid for the same length of time coletrain was laying on yours  which is a tad bit funny.
its supposed to be an origin story. no one was born sure footed and athetic.
@gabrielle oana  I disagree  in shadow of the tomb raider their is a level where you as a young lara have to scale the side of croft manor which would indicate thatshe s been climbing and exploring long before the events of the tr reboot. also  in the reboot she comfortably jumps from tree to tree and platform to platform when needed but for some reason cant find her footing at ground level  thatsame formula would apply to sottr also.
@quinton du plessis  she is trained but not that experienced. also untrue thatshe cant find her footing at ground level. what are you talking about  she kills dangerous animals basically bare-handed  not to mention hundreds of men attacking her. in the first game she is very traumatized by her circumstances but in the other games she is more confident. like I said though  she is yet to find herself. I agree thatshe is more badass with her guns and kick-ass moves in the original games but she isn t an incompetent in the reboot games either. I personally love both.
@gabrielle oana  I think you misunderstood  the real lara croft was very confident in her abilities and movements and the developers made sure you knew that because in later tr games there was a function that would allow lara to climb a ledge into a handstand and flip over onto her feet.this reboot lara cant seem to find a solid place to stand on  in the reboot she falls off of something in almost every segment of the game. the developers took successful ideas from uncharted and over did it.
@quinton du plessis  yeah I agree  they did take inspiration from uncharted  but I think they wanted to make it a more thrilling realistic experience. Imean even indiana jones  the original inspiration for tomb raider  wasn t perfect and often had a hard time finding a solid place to stand on. I dont think it was a creative choice  but rather a practical one. I think in the original games they didn t add that aspect because it was a complex thing to add to the game  meanwhile a few standard animations to make her land on her feet were easier to make.
@gabrielle oana  I think they did a bit more than just take inspiration from uncharted. as for the original tr  although indiana jones was an inspiration it wasn t the main one but even still  indiana jones is portrayed as a cocky  confidant man.just remember  realistic doest not mean better. the best games I have ever played were seeped in the impossible. as for lara not finding solid ground  I have no issue with the devs doing it once or twice but sadly it was overkill. I am not saying that reboot tr are terrible games but they are not great either.
congrats for speaking up  and telling your opinion. btw I dont understand why american mainstream media hates femininity so much. this happened with lara  with black widow  and it keeps happening with a lots of female pop culture icons  reboot lara looks like she uncomfortable with her femininity. they keep making them look like behave like males. I saw the rings of power trailer and omg  they totally changed galadriel. she was one of the most powerful beings on middle earth in the books  yet she didn t need a sword  or she didn t command an army. she was  beautiful  but she radiated power. she was a ruler  one of the member of the white council  but she also was a wife  and a mother.
100  agree. eidos has a crusade to erase all core s lara remnants and let s be honest  its the best character of all iterations  for all that you pointed out.
why do so many franchises go to the people who dont give a crap about them
I like the reboot lara too  story is not that bad. and she was not built by dumping on classic lara.I grew up with classic lara and I love these games too. lara and nikita made me get fit  more athletic and a gun nut to be fair  the new lara would make me want to be a mum.
the title  shadow of the tomb raider  is an accurate reflection of the fact that reboot lara will always be in her father s shadow. they really need to pass the development of the franchise to a new dev team  preferably an english one  to better represent the franchise s lineage.
game wise  I liked tomb raider 2013  and rise of the tomb raider grew on me. but shadow just seemed off. I hope the franchise doesnt continue down this path  but hope is never a great plan . for lara as a character it is interesting to hear a woman s perspective. and I completely agree with melonieI should add that while Im old enough to have played the og 1996 tomb raider  I didn t start until tomb raider legend. too bad I cant get tomb raider legend on ps4. Imiss that game
whenever I search for official classic lara images  I always have this sigh nowadays. I really just miss lara croft.
I had never touched any of these games until 2020  played the reboots first during the covid lockdowns then got into the originals afterwards  the 2007 anniversary of the original game is my favorite in the series. the problem I saw with the new games as someone who didn t even know the character yet when I was playing them is that there s two different lara crofts in the game   cutscene lara   and  gameplay lara . its like crystal dynamics cant decide what game they want to make. a great example is scene where she got her first kill in the 2013 reboot.  cutscene lara  was brilliant in thatscene  she reacts pretty much exactly how I d expect a random untrained and unprepared civilian to react to killing someone. the emotional impact of thatscene is immediately destroyed by  gameplay lara  absolutely just going to town on random henchmen with zero reaction like a stone cold killer. she racks up more kills than chris kyle by the end of the game.this happens all the time in the reboot series  we re expected to simultaneously believe that lara croft is this cold blooded killer who can mow down dozens of enemies at a time without remorse  then a cutscene will happen where cutscene lara cries about some random bs  or gets captured by 3 random baddies that gameplay lara would have gutted with her climbing axe. the strong focus on combat in the reboot series doesnt mesh with the kind of character they re trying to build. the originals didn t have this issue because lara only rarely ever fights humans in the original games. I think in the first game there s like 5 human enemies in the entire game.
fans  we love lara!!! a badass who earned herself as an icon and someone who women want to be like!!studios  so an average girl who s around cool situations  gotcha
I recently played through tomb raider legends again and damn. I really liked 2013 and shadow  but legends is so badass! I get what they tried to do but they better be done with it. bring back the mansion with the gym  add a gun range  put her on a motorcycle  feed jonah to a t-rex  and we re all good!
on a different subject I love your cat and yes classic lara croft seem to be stronger and more powerful and a great mind of her own and definitely not wimpy where the reboot lara was always crying always sad look wimpy an almost made the games unbearable to play it was like she was just having one big long and emotional skidmark.
I 1 000 000  agree with everything!! Im so glad one person is actually putting their opinion out there  because thats what they believe! Im someone who absolutely hates the reboot lara.. and as soon as they made her follow in her fathers footsteps it wasn t for the better.when I first got introduced to tombraider as a young boy  I wanted to be her  and thats just crazy..best way they could make the reboot canon would be that the girl who was in the latest games was just a delusional random who wanted to follow in the footsteps of lara croft and changed their whole identity to fit the bill  to the point of fabricating her own memories about her past  she is not lara croft and never was.its way more empowering being a rebel and even showing lara s 1 flaw as being a psychopath when it comes to the risks she takes to a degree ..dont ever stop! I will back anything you say about the classics anytime it makes me feel heard!
I didn t know the 2013 reboot was a massive story change. I remember playing tr1-3 as a kid  but I dont remember story details. I remember one level I was stock on days and eventually figured out I had to go up.... and I remember a mission in a place that looked like venice italy. beyond that  I remember nothing.
I personally love the new era lara games and I think the reboots are done mostly well. but yeah there is definetly some sort of crucifixion against og lara.
og lara s outfit looks like the daily outfit you see on any college campus during the spring and summer
I was too young and wasn t in the position to really play the older tomb raider games  but Ive always known who the character of lara croft was. mostly because of the movie with angelina and later found out that it was based on a video game.I do enjoy the reboot games  but only for the gameplay and the set pieces. and this reboot version of lara never set right with me. just her whole mindset never sat right with me. the idea of lara was always so cool to me  and I realized that idea was actually manifested in the og lara and now I wish the reboot was like the og.
you are feeling what many of us feel for other franchise like sw  drw  marvel dc comics  and so on. I feel the same way.  and the wokies keep taking over more and more franchise that come with a built in audience and destroying them. I love classic lara.  and the ps1 tombraider its one of the few games I can say  me  my siblings and even my father played from start to end.  and loved it.  my sister love original lara and flat out dislike the new one and even the one on the new movie.  we did like angelina portrayal of hers.  sexy  cocky  bad ass  strong  smart and quick thinker.  and then we have  whatever this is.
you have a right to your opinion and as long as you give those that disagree with you  you thatsame right youre not wrong for having your opinion. keep up the passion you have its got you this far.
frankly I was never big into og lara  my hero was duke nukem and I was mostly into rts at the time soo..I remember playing breafly probably maybe legend  I remember the campaign ads for legends tho.my first lara was the reboot  survivor   and I have recently finished shadow and I was genuinely entertainment by all three although to story got weaker and less focused over time..and there plenty of issues I have with the three but still.although I get that this is a huge departure from og lara but frankly is more interesting as a character. more rounded less cartoonish and with an interesting journey through the series..even now.. Im playing the legend timeline and lara feels dry..meh.. uncompelling at best. the character doesnt have anywhere to go.but I am personally a bit tired of cant do wrong protagonists.as much as I loved the duke back in my youth now I want drama and morally grey in my action adventure. the time of duke nukem is gone  probably forever. and frankly I dont miss him.about her look.I agree that dual wealding is more recognizable than bow but let the girl wear some protective clothing ffs she is dodging trex  scaling mountains and trekking jungles in a pair of boxers! as a mountaineer myself thats cringe af.having served for three years I cant ger over how stupid and impractical dual wealding handguns is or cartwheeling in the midst of an engagement..I like a scantily clad voluptuous woman as the next guy but good grief praxis! a pragmatic lady like croft wouldn t wear shorts while climbing.I frankly find reboot lara way more attractive.  although they should increase her upper body musculature modern game have embraced photorealism for the most part which mean cartoonish shapes are out of the question.unless is a stilistic choice before development.  thats why cd kept a more cartoonish lara for the  lara croft  branded staff.what many og fans I hear want is a more cartoonish art style to take itself less seriously. not saying it cant work  I bought the spyro reignated just recently but was pure nostalgia.. .. just saying doesnt seem to be what drives the action adventure genre this days.the me as long as cd doesnt throw reboot lara in the trash they can do what they want. also I would point out that I find extremely weird hearing reboot lara being called  woke   my anti-woke-garbage sense are extremely acute and never tingled once.. first of all shadow is from 2018 the woke virus wasn t epidemic yet back there.. also supposed  woke  lara is a rounded character that makes mistakes improve evolve.. woke characters are usually the opposite they are always rights everybody agree with them they can do no wrong..if they are women they are even worst..frankly I was genuinely surprised that in 2018 allowed a female and male to be human in a game.. and not cardboard cutouts..she isn t quippy or oneliner I get it but right now I dont need another quippy sassy oneliner character...there are simply too many as a trope is atrocious..after marvel got popular again every protagonists need to be a quippy oneliner... well it ruined starwars  it ruined star trek  is ruining lots and now is ruining marvel.its like poetry. it rhymes.rebooted lara made lara relevant again before that the brand was as dead as it can be. so think before you throw it all away for pure nostalgia.
you just said everything I wanted to say thank you
cutscene lara  oh I would never want to disrespect your peoples culture or your sacred burial placesgameplay lara  lemme just smash apart this ancient mural to open up a path so I can get the treasure in this tomb
modern tomb raider shares the same name and thats it - its a completely different entity
assassin s creed..
I dont think Ive ever watched an action movie with some handsome  buff badass guy beating up hoards of bad guys and thought  damn  I wish that guy looked more average so I could relate to him more .
when I play lara croft  classic  I think shes the most badass person ever but then I started playing the newer ones and mmmm they changed her sm. she cry s sm about everything. not only that but the moviessss are so different  in the older games she s so flexible and athletic  she would literally do backflips  and the newer ones games she can barely jump without almost dying every-time idk but I will forever love classic lara and the games are sm fun to play  I still play them till this day
good points about how crystal dynamics did more  sexualizing  of lara than classic lara. not that I have an issue with it. they are trying to appear woke  by dunking on classic lara  like you said. I really dont think they care about woke ideology  they are just pandering to it.
what is it with old franchises deciding that their franchise needs to be not what it is. same happened with assassins creed as well it frustrates me to no end.
lady amelia croft   close your eyes darling young lara   I dont want to close my eyes.
I will always love tomb raider. og lara forever!
Im still waiting to fight a t rex in the new tomb raider games.
just subscribed and love your based stance. keep fighting the woke!
Ive not played tomb raider so Im wondering do they not have the option to design your own character during character creation  Im thinking about how in fallout 4 the player has a lot of control over how their character looks and if you download mods you have even more options. it makes sense to me to allow the player to design the type of character they like most.
your videos just popped up in my feed recently and Im glad it did! keep up the great work!
genuine humility earns genuine respect.
I also love tombraider and played like every game when I was younger. and trust me  I also dont understand it. she was a great rolemodel for many young guys and gals!
cat  exists -- takes all the attention -- tries to eat the micme  awww! he sensed the coming stress and volunteered to be a stress fluff!
what company s  do you think would be a good fit for tomb raider and which one would you want to buy it from square enix
justice for classic lara.
classic lara was so popular and clicked with so many people thatshe became a cross media celeb. in advertising for nonvideo game stuff. probably beating actual real life celebs for those advertising jobs. was put on a bunch of non video game magazine covers if I remember correctly  cause she was the hot new thing with a media storm never seen. the closest was maybe pac-man and that was not treated like the virtual celeb lara was. you dont get the kind of status she got without acceptance from both male and female readers. never heard any hate for her from any irl girls in the 90s. the only thing that I can remember a girl disliking about tr was she was creeped out by the isolation she felt with lara being alone in the game.
that putty-cat sure wanted them pets.. right now  human  pay attention to me!   most cats  probably
oh  come on  neolara does more than just get beat up and cry. she also has an emotional breakdown over shooting a deer for food  but manages to will herself past it thatshe can fell person after person with the sociopathy of nathan drake in the very next gameplay section. yass queen slay  even more !
you did not show trlr lara model tho  which is another example on how eidos booped their noses in and told core to make her sexier  where they achieved it by making her shoulders narrower  the highlights really prominent on her breast and ass and gave her a low neck line  which was not core intention as you can see her looking really different in her cgImodel
you speak like real lara croft! 100  agree with every word!
u play tomb raider u play as lara croft its not a dark souls or fallout game where ur character doesnt talk and have no personality
@jjfgc cbchbg  in fallout 4 your character talks a lot and the player makes dialogue choices that impact the story. rp is a major component of the game.
forreal
I played the first version when it released it was cool but I could not get into the graphics. I dont have enough nostalgia about it now to have an opinion either way. the first reboots were much better but auto aim kinda sucked. I still replay anniversary to this day. the 2nd reboots were much more fun for me because of manual aim which allowed for headshots. that came with a price of changes to her character model sadly.  I understand they had to make her less capable to fit her story arc but that came at a price of deemphasizing the tomb raiding so the 2nd reboots are mixed for me
couldn t agree more and man my favorite lara is from the legends trilogy  tomb raider anniversary   tomb raider legends  and tomb raider underworld . just chefs kiss
I feel like I am already waiting for an amazing tomb raider title since 1999
look  I think its laughable when someone points at a classic superhero and says he s an ideal representation of the male body and masculinity  but Im not going to call itsexism or demand that the character be altered. exaggerated physicality and character traits can work really well for characters like that  and I dont see how it promotes  diversity  to limit or remove characters like that. imagine if people started complaining about the hulk because he s too muscly and angry.
the only bad words I d have for core design is that when they realized they had a hit they accidently ran tomb raider into the ground by pumping out too many games too quickly. Imean  I understand why they did it. lara croft had become a sensation bigger then the game she was in  probably being one of the first digital celebrities before even hatsune miku. lara is more of a star then the people who work on her. I guess the women working in the company didn t like being reminded that a digital woman is prettier and more popular then they are.
love how your cat just sliiiiiiides right in for some attention and you didn t miss a beat haha
not a fan of tomb raider  but even Im fully aware of the impact of the first game and the fact that lara croft is one of the biggest video game icons of all time following mario  sonic and crash. lara croft is a timeless character design that got big for a reason. Im baffled that people in charge of the series want to erase its history so bad and replace it with something completely bland. its like they re trying to revise the entire history out of some kind of shame.
classic old school lara was a strong  sexy and independent. I suspect those bashing were not even born around time those games were made and or have never played them. there was also an insanely stupid article recently saying how aloy from horizon zero dawn is some sorta revolution in gaming when we have had the likes of samus  bayonetta and lara to name a few  -
and lara used to fight some crazy creatures and monsters like living statues and dragons. now she fights... armies of men in each game. lol
at this point in time  is there any of the original devs from core design that worked on the original game working at crystal dynamics  or have they all quit due to years of crunch  crystal dynamics should have stuck with the legacy of kain  and soul reaver games.
you should see critical drinker s vid on thetale of two laras. he has a point why the latest trilogy is so lackluster compared to classic lara. https   www.youtube.com watch v cgufaai7hiq t 715sthere was no need to change lara s origin story because she was an established strong female protagonist who had her own cool persona. square enix clearly wanted to retroactively change her origin story to divide the fans and run with their own woke version of pretend lara. the problem with this change  it will be impossible to unify sotr   tr I because the personalities are way too different. therefore  until square has a new game coming out that bridges  these 2 personas  the current lara should be forver be known as retcon lara.
loved classic laura. not because her looks which were bad ass. it was her kick ass game play and story. keep going boom on the wokes.
wow your video was so powerful today! I totally agree with everything you are saying.
I totally share your point of view!!I feel better when I hear tomb raider fans from the very beginning insulting the job of reboot team keep it up and f the w0k s !!cheers
gotta kickstart something and make a new lara croft. even if you guys get your way they ll monkey paw you  just where these old school series have gone.
great vid. I also miss classic lara
what a sweet cat. so mel  lara croft cosplay when  I feel like thats the next logical step here  pull it off better than the studio does. you clearly love this ip so stick it to  em.
Im just waiting for the laura and abby team up show on netflix
I am a man. my favorite video game character of all time is probably master chief john spartan 117. he is a 7 foot tall  genetically enhanced super soldier drafted at the age of 7 and has since endured the hardest military training ever invented in human history. he wears bulky green armor that basically turns him into a walking hulking tank  has reflexes fast enough to nearly dodge bullets  can rip through steel with his bare hands  and had the body of an 18 year old olympic athlete by the age of 12.if they turned him into a sad  middle-aged man with a beer gut and who gets winded running less than a mile to make him more  relatable  but he was still somehow kicking alien ass  absolutely no one would take the character seriously  want anything to do with the franchise or want anything to do with him as a character. its the same with lara croft.
melonie bustin  out one of my fav verses!
thank you so much  Im glad you enjoyed this my friend
@melonie mac go boom  of course your welcome! if crystal doesnt get their stuff together with the unified lara they should definitely be removed from making anymore games. the hypothesis that you put together is that the upper bosses feel jealous or intimidated that people still remember the original laa. itsounds like ego  pride  and selfness to me. they dont realize they have rights to the very much franchise that they are trying to change and they should appreciate it instead of looking into their own butts!

someone infiltrator at crystal dynamics is jealous of lara croft s beauty  strength  agility  knowledge  sex appeal   attitude
hey mel  haven t been on this account for a while and I just now discovered you have made this new channel. insta sub for your takes.
the death animations in the new games hurt my soul a bit. I like them overall.
ignoring the outfits for a second and looking at reboot lara s personality  as you noted -  getting her butt kicked  she s crying  and she s a people pleaser  and that was fine... for the first game. why in the nine hells is she still crying and helpless in the third  why didn t she mentally grow through her experiences into something that felt like classic lara
I think its really cool that you put the scripture in your videos. awesome scripture. God bless you and your family. duane.
but the new lara croft is realistic. she goes up against ten guys at a time who are heavily armored and she comes out on top. realistic.
love you melonie...there are many brainwashed people around us these days. there is no talking with many of them. keep pushing and following yeshua!
melonie spoke facts
also ignore haters on twitter  people never watch the videos  they just want something to knee jerk react to. they re just hungry for the next outrage  and I hate thats what the culture on twitter has become.  I feel like reception on youtube to your channel has been overwelmingly positive  so keep it up
thats what I dont understand. if you ask people if they rather look ugly or beautiful and sexually attractive.99  rather be sexy and beautiful. and games are a fantasy escape. its normal people want to look as good as possible.its not sexist or anything.keep up the good work melonie.
love your content!
Im shocked with how much these weirdos insist in going after lara when tifa has been flashing her amazing figure even more now in ff7r  but you dont hear them talking about her  oh the double standards....
classic lara   you see that dangerous mountain full of dangerous animals and traps that could kill anyone daring to venture in there... there s an artifact there that Imust get for my collection so I can study it.... and maybe I will find out clues to stop some dangerous demi-God person while im at it. im an explorer and adventure like my father before me modern feminist lara    wait...... why should I go up that mountain.... I need to check twitter.... oh this stupid snake... its freaking cold... wahhhhhh I got some boo boos on my hand and leg!!!!!. I have daddy issues
to the men   yeah sure  you can have ridiculously big muscles a la gears of war  you can even take your shirt off  do whatever you want. to the women   why are you wearing shorts  omg!  and you need a breast reduction. equality!
the only thing I  remember about the new tomb games  pain and forgettable
Im not sure about  empowering   but soft reboot lara s story sounds more compelling than pure og lara.instead of just being a badass who adventured for adventure s sake. she s following in her father s footsteps. not to be in his shadow  mind you. the man died with his life s work unfinished. lara made it her purpose to find what her father was looking for so that he didn t die in vain.
looking at the picture you showed of classic lara pointing her pistol just look at her eyes  those are the eyes of someone who doesnt take any shit!
lara crofttifachun-litop 3 most famous female videogame characters of all time.
yeah I wish people would stop cringing about the past  I agree classic lara was badass  up there at the top of strong women in video games  along side samus aran and jill valentine.
tomb raider came out when I was a young lad... loved the first game.
if not for double standards they would not have any
they were talking about her. the japanese devs just didn t listen.
if we re sticking to one per franchise I agree. but I d add aerith   cammie to that list.
is itsafe to say classic lara would kick modern woke lara in 3 seconds
spot on commentary!
lol  you know that helicopter scene where she sticks a gun to the pilot s head because he didn t agree to her demands  or how about how she caused a tsunamI and killed a bunch of people and all she cared was to find the silver dagger.
I just discovered you and your channel I wanted to tell you that you have been a real encouragement to me.  I wanted to return the favor and encourage you to keep doing what you are doing.  I also wanted to share scripture with you as you have shared scripture with me.  1 thessalonians 5 12-22  12 we ask you  brothers  to respect those who labor among you and are over you in the Lord and admonish you  13 and to esteem them very highly in love because of their work. be at peace among yourselves. 14 and we urge you  brothers  admonish the idle  c  encourage the fainthearted  help the weak  be patient with them all. 15 see that no one repays anyone evil for evil  but always seek to do good to one another and to everyone. 16 rejoice always  17 pray without ceasing  18 give thanks in all circumstances  for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you. 19 do not quench the spirit. 20 do not despise prophecies  21 but test everything  hold fast what is good. 22 abstain from every form of evil.   -grace and peacesean
thats a good question..  whos gonna remember this  . not us classic lara fans..
you can focus on helping other people without being a pushover.  actually you ll be better at it if youre tough.
the fans of classic laura should make their own indy game and call it tomb ransacker lol and have laura use a pseudonym because she s  undercover . laura craft
this why I get all lara content from 3ds artist.  blender sfm
there are thousands of us thatsupport you for every one of those that dont... keep the faith
let s be honest. the people who complain about her outfits have never spent much time if any in a gym.
I really miss her dual pistolas  the bow is lame  like I understand with the first reboot game she hasn t gained her footing yet and is scavenging her hardware to survive but with  2 she should of done away with the bow  a bow isn t some pistol you can just carry in a holster and dealing with people with guns and tigers.also its pretty redundant when you get a silenced gun too.
the irony of them hating classic lara is that classic lara was a much more powerful and independent woman than nulara ever would be.
Im glad I caught you on the drinker s channel. you got a sub.
I never got into tomb raider. probably because I didn t have a playstation as a kid and when I did get to play it at other people s houses  I couldn t figure out what I was doing  I was like 12 .Ive always had an appreciation for the franchise but that failure as a kid killed my interest in the game.
watch melonie playing the game.pre-crystal dynamics  oh  hey  thats tomb raider!post-crystal dynamics  whatcha playin   last of us
hey melonie just curious what are your thoughts on tomb raider underworld anniv and legend  my fav was is and will always be underworld! by the way awesome job on destroying all those woke nitwits!!!
the original tomb raider will always be my favourite game.  currently halfway through shadow of the tomb raider  and its leaving a sour taste in my mouth. Im determined to get through it though...
crystal dynamics is all   she made us multImillions of dollars  we hate her
something kinda ironic  I know toby gard said lara was inspired by tank girl  and in 2012 his sister.  but I heard her og costume is taken from ellie from jurassic park  specifically the last quarter of the film. laura dern is and was an outspoken feminist and she apparently had no issue with her outfit.
here is how many times I played the reboot tomb raider games. once. played through all 3 of them once. completed them and was done with them. and people want to complain about classic lara and how she used to be. reboot lara is unbelievable. she flooded a whole town and instead of want to help people  she would rather go after the ass holes who killed her dad and get back what they stole. if it was not for jonah  she would have just kept going after them. she acts like she cares about doing the right thing. but  then  she goes right back to being a spoiled brat.yeah  thats your great new lara croft. plus  the one thing that made me say  please no more reboot lara is the fact the games barely were like the originals. sure we had our bad guys to fight and everything but  too much of a good thing can always be way too much of a bad thing. there was just way too much with fighting bad guys then  there was her exploring ancient tombs without a gun fight or some other crazy crap first. let s face it  no one is ever going to hold a candle to the original lara croft aka the tomb raider.
they didn t make classic lara  core design did. they hate her because they didn t make her  so they want to erase and replace
I never understood why there cant be a world where in this case  both versions can be accepted. actually  acceptance is a huge thing but so is hypocrisy.  also  lara back than felt like a mother I never had to me and the lara now feels like the daughter I never wanted but there is unconditional love either way.  d and these self entitled manager cant earn any respect when they dont have at least some for the history of a character that could and also should evolve over time in my opinion. it feels like they doing it on purpose for some weird reason. who knows.   _   _  thank you for bringing it up in put some sense it all that nonsense. keep it up and good day to y all.
the final fantasy tactics mobile game had a collab with tomb raider and they chose classic version to be in the game not modern lara which was a great call.
melonie  the problem is that these people have never been inside a gym  they dont know what people wear there
boomers  definition - shortly after ww2 us troops were returning home  having fulfilled their military obligations they obtained their benefits  got married and had babies at roughly the same time. schools and playgrounds had to be built to support this new huge generation of kids who more or less overly populated  they later had kids and a gamer girl named melonie mac created a youtube channel dubbed  melonie mac go boom  and thus those subscribers to that channel were named  boomers .
1996   lara croft is the avatar of female empowerment. strong  agile  smart  confident  adventurous  gorgeous. 2013   lara croft is sexist cause big boobs    doge meme.
also should definitely start a movement to support classic lara and explode twitter
Im so mad  Im f-ing sobbing . this person seriously needs to get a life.
im a huge fan of tomb raider  has life size model of loura croft in her room
isn t there a rather sizeable age difference between classic lara and reboot  might explain the difference in body shape and confidence level. go classic lara!!
I agree with you over everything you talk about in this.
as someone who purchased the game when it came out. the only place lara was sexualized at all was magazines and promo materials. in game it was a athletic girl doing indiana jones type stuff. altho I feel indy would have pooped his pants if he walked in a room with a trex.  d the character model was a little exaggerated since its ps1 after all. not much you can do to make it clear who she is with a poly budget of 200 or whatever. tifa in the final fantasy 7 remake is something like 120 000 vertices for reference. another thing is the 2013 lara isnt realistic at all. she heals like wolverine. thatspike that went in her belly at the start of the game wouldnt have killed her right away but 2 days later she wouldnt have been going anywhere. silly magic healing powers but look guys we made her boobies smaller! blah.
I ll tell ya rn  I bought the recent trilogy on psn bc on sale at Christmas but again much in agreement with everything the old versions of lara before cd took over looks much better athletically and badass vs. emotionless and whining. once I get through the reboot series tho Im going to play the classic ports. bc the classic build is more recognizable to me. also you cant fix stupid with people like this that your dealing with daily you just cant.
I am love with your cat  he or she looks like  poesekop  the first cat I have known  she even fended of a curious dog when I was a baby.
I thought the new games were pretty fun. I skipped the entire ps3 era of gaming so my experience with modern gameplay design and graphics is still all still feeling  new  to me. I never disliked the original ps one games I just hated the controls. lol. it would be cool to see her be a badass again though.
angel of darkness and legends was my favorite lara s
eidos were wrong to market lara the way they did. they didn t care whether it was consistant with the character or not and were only interested in making money off her sexy figure. they couldn t see past their own nose and thats what killed classic tr. eidos  greed and shortsightedness.and the saddest part it that it was core  not eidos that paid the ultimate price for eidos  failiures.
why they never game the new lara her duel guns. was waiting for it to happen but they stuck her with that climbing hook thing all the time  and a bow.
I never played any games before the 2013 reboot. I like those games  and I like that lara croft. I dont really see here as androgynous. but hey  like I said  I dont know the old games. so maybe you are right.
chasing realism can really ruin fantasy. I think tomb raider would be better off if it was more stylized. I think of donkey kong country or how to train your dragon  you can have realistic looking textures and lighting used on stylized characters  in many cases it looks fantastic.
gotta ask  is cole train named after the augustus cole of gears of war
the classic games gave us a 16 year old lara at one point. also in shadow lara was 23  and in tr1 she was 28. not much of a difference.
they can call me misogynist. but no one can beat lara croft of the 90s in my heart.
my new theory is the woke crowd is actually sexually attracted to the shorter leg  stockier  not classically sexy woman and are just doing all this for characters they want to get off to.
all her outfits made sense for the task she was going to do. typical dress code the piblic would wear.
the writer director should be ashley bruch. we ll get exactly our 90 s epic lara croft that defy patriarchy we deserved
the 96 lara croft is what I see in my mind when I hear her name.  idk what this new bs is.
fun fact  lara s classic outfit was based on laura dern s outfit in the first jurassic park film. so  if people are going to say classic lara is misogynistic  you might as well say that laura dern was being misogynistic while running away from dinosaurs. sounds stupid doesnt it
crystal dynamics  best tomb raider game imo  is tomb raider anniversary  a remake of the original game. says quite a bit about how great classic lara is.
thats not lara croft. thats lara kid sister.
I liked the one 2013 tomb raider  and the two sequels.but all this news about where the series is going now worry me.
25 39 this !vote with your wallets guys
angel of darkness was a pretty good game imo.
people should be required to show proof of purchase of a game or a save game file hash to prove they played.
the new lara is less relatable cus she no longer understands my back pain
I liked the gameplay of the reboot series but damn if classic and legend lara isn t a much more enjoyable personality to be around lol. modern lara was either a sad sack or laser driven psychopath lol
british ice queen  dixit   two things  ice queen  she was focused on her job  and  dixit
well after seeing this its pretty much confirmed to me now that my favourite game series deus ex will also go woke in the next game since its the same studio that makes the tr reboot series
I enjoyed the reboot trilogy  but classic was before my time so I dont have much to compare it with.  I kept on hoping they would make her more feminine but they didn t.
that cat doesnt understand what is at stake here
do people remember  metroid other m  the game in which nintendo tried to humanized samus by dwarfing her  recieving order from her former male officer while the blonde bounty hunter was traumatized and had ptsd the whole story metroid dread kinda made me forget this game.
I came because of the quartering  but I stayed for the levelheaded commentary.
people can say it in the comments. yes  the devs too are most likely woke because we know of all the issues they have in the workplace and strikes they do when not getting their way. now  not all of the devs  but enough of them and we see them on twitter giving their opinions.
classic lara is the best
now crystal dynamics went woke
let s not forget that the original tr was one of the first fully 3-d games ever made. it was groundbreaking. as well as one of the first strong and sexy leads. the reason the woke mob hates it is because other people like it. boom.
fhat suit at 12 57 looks interesting!
yeah  very bad argument. the new games examine lara at the beginning of her journey into what she becomes in the classic games. have the company even said that they are trying to make the classic lara non-canon
where did you get that giant tr statue
I played tomb raider before  Im gonna be playin  her again on ps1  ps2  ps3   ps4  very soon
I  wanna hear what cole train has to say about this ... seems he s pretty mad at it too
all you have to do is compare  the popularity of the  classic  tomb raider games to the 3 in the reboot series this franchise went from being  one of the most iconic and recognisable things in gaming  to ohh right  that game mehh.
Ive always been a fan of crystal dynamics for their work on blood omen   soul reaver  blood omen being my favorite game of all time  written   directed by a woman omg!! this drivel just ruins not only the legacy of tomb raider  but of crystal dynamics as well. sad...edit its funny these ppl hate incessantly on Christianity   the patriarchy  what they rly mean is the  phallocentric judeoChristian mythos  or w e   yet they have a saviour complex that rivals the catholic church   these hyper-puritan standards of dress   conduct that put it woefully to shame. does that qualify as hypocrisy also  didn t know this was a Christian channel. subbed.
if I want to get into playing the tomb raider games which games would yourecommend
oh no  I didn t know that a lot of people want to forget and erase classic lara wtf this saddens me. at first when playing tomb raider 2013 I thought she was going to develop her sexiness and cockiness and badassness over time  but nope.
thats why I could appreciate angelina jolie ...at least she looked like the first version somewhat... imagine what the new movie version will look like taking from the new lara
original lara craft was a badass.
I personally enjoy the tr reboot games  and I dont really see them as  woke   but I definitely feel its wrong for anyone to try to phase out classic lara. I think both classic and current lara are awesome in their own way. I think its disgusting that people attack you the way they do just for having a different opinion  and these are the people that call themselves   tolerant.  absolute insanity.also I think you should put   w  special cole train appearance   in the title. cute kitties always up the view count even more lol
samus started off ambiguous but then embraces her feminity. the stark difference between western and japanese developers is night and day.
kinda hoping that crystal dynamics shies away from this current-gen way of thinking  like the new tomb raider games and avengers  and turn back to their heyday of earlier games and ideas. not just tomb raider anniversary but also legacy of kain and gex. going new with politics and  woke  fans isn t the way to go.
dont let these people guilt trip you  or anyone else  they talk about insecurities but they re the most insecure people imaginable. they think that any woman that looks like she didn t stop developing at the age of 12 is sexist because they literally did  either that or their gigantic spheres trundling around on swollen legs  trying desperately to pretend like they re not insecure. the entire push that these people have to slowly turn lara croft into essentially the love child of scott steiner and abby from the last of us is basically because she represents everything that they re never ever going to be and when I say she represents everything they re never going to be  Imean the  flat lara . they re never even going to be that. they want her to become more and more androgynous because its the only way that they can feel any sort of inner happiness which is pathetic and sad and projecting in so many different directions...
angel of darkness lara is the prettiest
indeed
I thought the 2013 reboot wasn t bad.. as a standalone prequel game though. I dont think they should ve done rise or shadow.
start from the beginning  with the first game. tomb raider iI is also an excellent game as well.
modern tomb raider is extremely woke  sadly
@melonie mac go boom  to me wokeism is constantly pushing the sjw stereotypes. I honestly dont see it in the modern tr games. modern lara still looks like a woman  and I would think if sjws had their way  she would look more manly  or fat  because apparently they re big on fat acceptance . she also has a lot of brutal death scenes in the modern games  and I would think sjws wouldn t want to see a woman get brutalized so much in very gruesome scenes. I remember seeing a lot of fake feminists  male and female  cry over those scenes. to me  a perfect example of wokeism is modern day captain marvel  and the less said about that trash  the better lol
wow meloinc mac has grown a lot the old meloinc mac that I started following back in 2011 has returned
what original lara croft wear is exactly the same clothes you see most women wearing everywhere on streets  beachs  gyms.
angelina jolie s scene in tomb raider with edge hill by groove armada playing in the background...
the problem is the men making the game surounded themselves with women who are jealous of strong curvy women with big boobs  they hate that they do not look like the  power fantasy  they are jealous of the women who do look like the power fantasy  and there are many   they try to claim that women who do look like this do not exist or its a physique that is impossible to attain  even though cross fit exists.
there s sheena  wonder woman  and lara croft.
Im glad to know you as a woman understand the fictional female characters with unrealistic body proportion or body standard is just a power fantasy and not sexist or misogynistic and find nothing wrong with it even when the female character is in a bikini.
these people care more about the feelings of fictional women than real women.
hImelonie I hope your enjoying your weekend thus far  now that being said I just cant stand that video games aswell as movies that were really goodhave been forced to be rebooted to tryto  have todays people to enjoy them.its been longtime since Ive played games.seeing how the rebooted lara croft is so annoying to me.what is sofreaking wrong with the original lara croft  now what I said about rebootingmovies only have embarrassed the originals thers a reason why they areoriginal for they have standed test through time.I would say these movies but Im sure you know which ones Im referring to.now more importantly melonie keep your fabulous advice things going .I enjoying seeing your newfabulous chanel. takecare melonie
are the newer tomb raiders not supposed to be an origin story  it would make sense she s not some peak athlete and would be terrified of being thrown into near death situations. also the newer lara s are most likely based off real life existing people. since they capture all the looks and features with mocap.
lara croft is now just female nathan drake
I would like to see the gaming history of these woke people including there trophies
Imean I prefer reboot lara but I watched this whole vid and I have no issue with your take. I d never tell you to off yourself.
who s in charge of crystal dynamics
people keep forgetting the attitude to have with these people  they attack and they expect you to scream your defense. with the release of the tomb raider games being on the saturn and the playstation  with later releases on pc and mobile  the series before the reboot has sold nearly 50 million units. remember the majority of those units were playstation and saturn as the pc port came years later.while the reboot series has been released on every platform from steam to playstation  and during the coof they made it free to download and add to your steam library so part of the sales for that are likely false  so with these facts in place do this oh yeah  og lara is misogynistic  it was and is what is selling games  we dont much care about your feelings on this matter  we like the sexy and we like the action  stop complaining and go away. they want you to complainthey want you to get angrywhat they dont want you to do is shrug  ignore them and just be okay being the  evil  thing they say you are. they re the ones making claims and if you care what they think you ve already lost this fight  they will always think you are the evil thing they say you are because you aren t on their side.
hey mel I just want to say that if I was you and everyone else who love and like the classic laura croft   classic tomb raider games that I would go after the company who make tomb raider games and would tell them to quiet slandering classic laura croft   classic tomb raider games   exhibit and move on to something else before we the people quiet buying their stuff bc of them slandering the classic laura croft   classic tomb raider stuff  ok mel. anyway I just want to say bout this topic   I just want to let you know what I think bout this topic  ok mel. also I just want to tell you that I really like and love how you are describing your feelings bout each issue of the topics that you post on twitter   on youtube   I just want to say that I am with on each topic   I think that you are doing a great job   I just want to tell you to keep it up   go after what you want to go after   keep preaching your feelings   your issues   I got your back on anything you want to talk bout on social media  ok mel. anyway have a great evening at home with your pets and have a good night mel.
me as an original tomb raider fan for over 20 plus years now. I am over the daddy issues. it worked for the angelina jolie first tomb raider movie but right after that the movie sequel focused on her own motives. for the legend timeline they should have only focused on her mother for tr legend and lara should have moved on for tr underworld. as far as the reboot definitely her father shouldn t have been the main focus on the last 2 games. the whole point of the reboot was for lara to become the lara croft we know today by her own will not because of  her father s shadow. shadow of the tomb raider should have been the turning point in her life where we would see her become the powerful inspirational character but sottr felt short in that regards! its infuriating thatshe as a female has to follow a man s footsteps. its not empowering to a female character. I believe at this stage of the franchise if crystal dynamics dont pull off the unified lara with the new netflix show upcoming game  and movie sequel  they should be removed from making anymore games they ve been the cause of the division in the fanbase and other problems within the games they ve made the last 15 years. their games are good because its still tomb raider but they could have been even better with the right team and more focus on classic style games.
laura is going to transition into larry croft at this rate  why cant there be women that look like they take care of themselves
yo reboot lara s design was just a secrets model.
they really just think people sit there at home in front of their computer and sob at how lara is better looking than them. she s not supposed to be relatable  she s a badass. I for one really enjoyed all 3 of the reboot titles  and I like how they played. I enjoyed the bow aspect even though its not the classic double pistols. what I absolutely do not want to see though is for her to go from  women want to be her and men want to be with her  to  relatable like the girl next door . people say old lara was oversexualized. of course the old body despite graphical limitations is dated. Im all for the more realistic look they went with in tr2013 rise. even shadow despite the fact she gets flatter by the minute.the irony to me though is that they complain about oversexualizing  yet then bring her relationships and sexual orientation into the story while we dont care about. if anything  make her asexual  she s in it for raiding tombs  not wombs.tl dr  give me a graphically updated character model in the style of 2013 or rise  but leave her as a solo tomb raider who is not relatable  but admirable.edit  guardian of light  not riseedit2  talking about realism  can someone who literally hangs from ridges on the side of a mountain above spike pits  fire  or waterfalls at least look athletic
I feel old being called a boomer lol
they say they are but an origin story vs a character who looks and acts nothing like her original counterpart are two completely different things. lara already had an origin story in tomb raider the last revelation  and it was far better and didn t change lara s look or personality.
@melonie mac go boom  I haven t played the newer games. so I dont know anything about how she s portrayed  but I ll make a bold assumption and assume your grievance is correct.
honestly  the first reboot game from 2013 should have been enough as lara s origin story  but the devs publisher decided to milk its success  which ultimately led to an overly drawn out  incoherent origin trilogy. even streamers were laughing at the  become the tomb raider!  tagline by the time the third game was being advertised. it was like  again  .
thank you
I see women dressed like that regularly at my job. she s dressed like a normal woman who likes how they look.
yea the next most well known female character that is a protagonist is samus and metroid is not nearly as globally known as tomb raider  and she is in a suit where you cant really tell it is a she under  there. we should respect a character this iconic way more!
the complainers dont go to the gym
it is completely unsurprising that woke lara   weak lara. how many wokies end up being exposed as secret creeps and or woman haters
5 42 they were optional
the fact that developers and writers cant see beyond their so called woke ness and wish for realism triggers me. give us core lara. give us 90 s lara. dont fix what isn t broken God damnit.
a producer that decided desexualizing this beloved game character  ron rosenberg.  early life  check that last name
I think I know why they made lara this way  I dont think pleasing the woke is the entire reason.  I think its a similar reason to why they re doing this to many other franchises like star trek  star wars  halo and even he-man.  they dont want people to have any kind of hero that can give them any sort of boldness or attitude.  nothing that would generate any kind of strength.  they want people to be constantly fearful people pleasers   they want people to have personalities more akin to obedient slaves than free thinking individuals with ambitions and strengths.  people in constant fear are easier to manipulate.  it could also be a petty  childish spite to the fans born from how they view you from their ivory tower.when you mention these modern pharisees hypocrites  Im reminded of a verse in the Bible that easily applies to them. it has been a while since I read it and it was in the  new living translations  version  so take my paraphrasing with a grain of salt  but it goes something like this   dont try to remove the splinter in someone else s eye when you cant see past the log in your own  - some googling revealed that it might be somewhere in matthew 7 5  it was worded differently because of it being the king james version but  this is google we re talking about though so take that with a grain of salt as well.
classic lara croft is not misogynistic
I hate seeing this. I always thought the reason lara had big breasts was because of the limits of the graphics of the time.  I enjoyed playing tomb raider and tomb raider 2.  but the pre wokes were after her and her breasts back then. but she wasn t the only one. barbie was hounded for her large bust too. the argument was thatshe wasn t realistic woman for the girls to play with.  I guess that it doesnt matter what decade you are in someone is going to be a pain and complain. in my view it is sad that it be in game or tv or toys. thatsomeone has to take a non message point or body part and make a message out it  even when there is none to begin with. love what you do  keep booming
am I the only one who think lara lost her touch the instant her brand was given to a us developper instead of a european one while she looked the same in legend she sure didn t felt like herself.my perception is this. tomb raider was entering into her teenage phase with angel of darkness  yes it is buggy  and the devs where overwhelmed by the deadline but I can genuinly say that they were trying to grow the brand and the tone of the franchise.the first time I played legend... I was wondering what was going on when I saw the opening sequence... and her having a team behind her back. it felt like a saturday morning cartoon.
lara was made to be sarcastic  sexy and just a fantasy of a character. do these people know what being a woman is  lara wasn t made to be a  real human  I think they dont go on social media at all cause women like lara literally exists anyways making her a crybaby does not what a lara makes  she needs to be badass and alone for Gods sake.
to this day  I absolutely regret pre-ordering and buying shadow of the tomb raider... the promotional art  the trailers  game-play  everything was tailored and designed to hide the wokeness that the game had become. I fell for it... you see  tomb raider underworld is my personal favorite integration of lara croft. I feel like uw s lara is the highest pinnacle of lara s history and design since the very beginning. when I see uw lara croft  I see a evolved hd version of the original tomb raider 1 lara croft. thats just my opinion  but I feel like there was never going to be any better evolutionary design at that point in tr history.  I too  think that guardian of light s lara croft was well done with that  the only way to to move forward now  was to become realistic  both in design and in personality. regardless of where the franchise has gone now  I still love the first tr 2013 reboot game. keep in mind  Imean the  original face  version  not the  Im always mad definitive edition version.  I did not mind her new design and personalty  as Imentioned before  the height of the original lara croft design already existed  and there was noway they could go beyond that point  without changing things up. I dont think that it is fair for people to claim that the original reboot game was the downfall of lara. I believe thatstarted with rise of the tomb raider. keep in mind that the tr reboot  2013  was before woke culture became rabidly spreading in 2015. I hated rise when I first played it  I hated lara. she was annoying and on a completely different track than what was giving to us in 2013. what I did enjoy though  was the game-play and the brother sister backstory. since the time gap between rise and shadow was significant enough  I ended up being more forgiving on rise than I should have  when making the judgement to support shadow day one. and to this day  I still regret it.    but  for what it is worth  I am beyond more cautious about supporting censored woke games  to the point where I hardly ever buy day one anymore. in the 2000 s  I bought 30  games a year  I was so poor all the time  lol . now a days  I buy 2 or 3... if they are on sale.
the people that wrote this dont got to the gym and thus wouldn t know what a woman at the gym would wear.
the term is  slim thick .  her other is she has a large  thigh gap .  both considered to be rare beauty traits.
it reminds me of the dmc series. replaced cool confident dante with some whiny depressing woke hipster character. these people erase strong characters whilst claiming weak and vulnerability as strength or empowerment. what a crock.
alex zedra is the real laura croft.
cd messed up the reboot character progression. we could ve seen her develop over the 3 games from an unworldly inexperienced girl into the classic aloof hardened woman of the ps1 era. I guess the problem is tr long ago became just another coldly calculating corporate game  made by committee and an ever-changing dev team - no room for one individual s singular creative vision overseeing the team
I dont know I like the reboot lara too. she isn t invincible like captain marvel and she is still sexy
that explains why games like skyrim  eso  ff14  gw2  and the like are so big.  has nothing to do with game play and story.
@evacody124  I would say sure  but I haven t played enough of any of the mentioned titles to tell whether thats sarcasm or serious.  however  youre probably not wrong
oh  and with how lara croft is being treated as a martyr for wokeness now  yeah  I wont being buying any official products until they fix their attitudes and the franchise.
for real  absolutely zero concept of athletic wear and proportions of an athletic woman
I would call classic lara athletic  not slim thick. slim thick is skinny fat in the right places.
@melonie mac go boom  thx.  fat did not cross my mind.  its muscular.  like gymnasts except not as big and is stretched out.
even though Im playing the reboot tomb raider games  because reasons that I dont even know   I preferred classic lara croft over modern lara croft any day.
not a woke  but I like the newer lara croft. that bow is mean. she looks realistic. she is stealthier too. the cartoony look of  classic lara is awesome too  and it is not sexist. she is a super heroine  and super heroines have exaggerated features. the newer lara is lara before she became the badass we knew. lara croft grows and gets more confident. I believe they were going for more of the nathan drake style of a character due to uncharted s success.
in the future lara croft will a gray square with a pride flag on the front.
how are you going to slander a character youre developing in your own game!  that would be like nintendo slandering mario! that makes no sense...
okay I really am starting to see your point here mel.
nah reboot lara goes on and on about helping people but doesnt even act on it. so she just ends up sounding like a fucking psychopath  who steps over bodies to pursue her bottomless obsession while crying about how much of a trash person she is  expecting idiots to tell her that its not her fault but trinity s.in a sense  those who accused this version of being the epitome of the white savior trope were right. classic lara was unapologetic  maniacal  cold blooded and obsessed... but at least she had the decency to be blunt about it.reboot lara is so awful a person she s the perfect fusion of both konstantin and ana. in sottr she s a self-righteous snake with homicidal tendencies and a bunch of anger issues who keeps blaming trinity for the actions she takes... and the npcs might as well be figments of her broken mind because those who are  good  comfort her into her delusions while the bad guys point at what s actually wrong with her.
lol and me that I start a battle against cold iron studio for do not give any sexy marine in alien fire team because   there s not enough make up in the army  but there is always space for flashy lgbtq weapons. they try to guild trip  but they end up losing player. same thing would happen with tomb raider of they would go for that paths.
the first two comments telling you to kys is just psycho warning written all over  to tell someone else to take their own life... they are not psychologically well. but the last one cracks me up!  tagging others to draw attention to you for having an opinion of your own. wow... some ppl just cant handle that we are all different  that we are not born as the same person and to think and act in the same way.   everyone has to think like I do!  and what about freedom of speech
I remember playing a tomb raider game years ago and I had no problem with her body  I liked her figure. now they are making her look like a man and Im like . it certainly doesnt entice me to play the games. when I was little I loved she-ra and now the reboot is blah  they make her look like a boy and I still love the classic she-ra better. I am a tomboy and always have been  even if I am more masculine minded I am still a female and I still like female things. you can be tough and still be sexy. wonder woman was tough  but she was still feminine and sexy. lynda carter s wonder woman was my favorite super hero when I was a little girl.
she will look like abbie smash from tlou2 soon.
the only thing I like about the reboots is the incredible inclusion of assassin-like stealth as a stealth gamer. but  I dont enjoy the wokeness and the lack of tombs.
16 12  is this a character that would have the same impact that classic lara did  its square enix s 2nd best-selling game ever behind ff7. does that count for anything
reboot lara pisses me off ... sometimes I die a lot on purpose just to see her suffer.
what the hell are they talking about classic lara not being vulnerable  in the legend anniversary underworld trilogy she showed a hell of a lot of vulnerability. in legend near the end she nearly kills amanda  unloading a whole clip of ammo around her asking where her mother was. where. is. my. mother   avalon yet she still oozed badass-ness in that moment. I swear these woksters only picked up a game controller in the last 5 years. underworld was awesome in the dlcs when she allowed her draug doppelg nger to live a free sentient life after returning to kill natla. thatshows a lot of compassion  forgiveness and growth especially after the doppelg nger had killed alistair  destroyed her home and tried to kill her.
crystal dynamics  dont worry  reboot lara will eventually be the tomb raider everyone remember and love.every fan of the classics tomb raider games and many who play the modern  when! amswer  when they are done beating the living s  t out of her cause good grief she get beat up a lot in the reboot  I lost count the amount of times she should ve die in just the first reboot.
there was some drama about lost ark when it released in the west like 3 weeks ago. people complaining  oh the females in this game are too sexy  and appeal too much to the male fantasy  lol.. the gist of it is  female gamers responded saying  actually we love playing as sexy strong female characters  plus  there the fact thatsometimes the  male fantasy  is actually a female fantasy  I for one am lesbian  and I love it. classic lara croft was sexy  smart  and strong.. and they just cant seem to handle the image of a sexy woman these days. I just dont get them. its sad really.
I dont see any rings on your fingers but Im not going to hold my breath . you seem to have a very sweet kitty. what s its name  sadly I never played tomb raider  but did play the  h e double hockey sticks  out of half-life. and would be just as po d if they  woked  gordon freeman.  woked  isn t the correct term. I should have said  shit on . ah! kitty must be  coltrane .
you dont see anything less revealing at the gym.  youre implying the people who complain about this stuff have ever been to the gym before.
I dont hate the crystal dynamics tomb raider games. they are fine and that version of lara is cute  but Ive always thought classic lara was far more badass. why is it  stunning and brave.  for lara to be hot and badass
the first pic of survivor timeline lara might look like  a girl next door   if you live in a homeless camp in san fran.
the devs have been dragging out lara s origin story for almost a decade now  and  personally  I dont really care to know about the constant struggles of lara s new iteration  not to mention her daddy issues. can we skip to the part where she s a seasoned  agile  superintelligent badass who isn t concerned with being liked by every random person she meets now
classic lara is still miles more recognizable  tr2013 does not have even close to the same impact as a worldwide recognizable icon
@melonie mac go boom  I am not saying you are wrong  but what happened to the people who bought the older tomb raider games  tomb raider  underworld sold only 2.6 million copies. before that  tomb raider  anniversary only sold 1.3 million copies. I d feel that if those games sold better  square enix wouldn t feel the need to change anything  that or the eidos company still wouldn t be up for sale.
@melonie mac go boom   and the game company is there to make money.
legend annI underworld lara is not classic lara  she is compleeeeetely different
haha yup  Imade a video on this. gaming journos are so clueless
lol true
except she doesnt dress like that to go to the gym  but outdoors and in harsh conditions.
bahahaha true
oh my gosh I could rant about this all day. I hate that there are people out there who genuinely believe that classic lara was made to be a sex symbol. correction  eidos tried to advertise her sex appeal in order to entice people to buy the games. toby gard specifically made her to be badass. he created a strong independent woman who knows exactly what she wants and against the odds she goes for it and damn well succeeds. this no nonsense lara is the one I grew up with and aspired to be. fuck  relatable  lara coz you know what lara would be if she was relatable to me ! weak. she wouldnt persue her dreams  she would be crying all the time because she would have terrible anxiety. she wouldnt bother raiding tombs or fighting for her life coz she would become crippled by self-doubt. if lara was relatable to me  there would be no tomb raider and people who fuckin hate her. I dont understand why some people feel the need to bring everyone down to their level  including lara . why are we not allowed to have a strong power figure in tr  why cant she be superhuman  she aint fukin real!!! she is meant to be a fantasy figure for fuks sake!! without lara I wouldnt be a woman working in a mans world. I wouldnt have pushed trough my own self-doubt and anxiety to get a level 3 mechanic qualification at triple distinction grade. I wouldnt be working a good-paying job. if I looked to a  relatable  lara  I would be in the gutter on government provided benefits saying  its okay to be crippled in life with mental health issues  I will just live my life being scared and lonely and wabting to die everyday coz its okay . life should be about improvement  not takin what u got. fuck that! I say fuck it to my self doubt and fuck it to my anxiety voz like original lara  im gonna be strong and independent. im gonna rely on me to get a good job so I xan get good money and better myself. my goal in life is to attain courage  knowledge and wisdom and use them in the be way I can. and og lara taught me that.
people remaking lara croft for feminism didn t understand what feminism stands for. they re basically telling us that for a woman to be strong and powerful she has to be less of a woman
Lord help us all
the old lara had the entire package - she was gorgeous  sassy  strong  and determined - a definite bad a  .  cross her at your peril  she fully intended to get to that treasure first!  Imiss the old lara  I dont remember her weeping   wailing in the old games  and stop calling for jonah  for heaven s sake .  wish I could play the old games on my ps5.as a woman I  much!  prefer playing the old confident version of lara - please crystal dynamics stop making her so bland - it makes it boring to play as her  as opposed to relatable.  the people that complain about the strong beautiful version are likely not buying your game  rather simply engaging in activism.
this is actually ridiculous. crystal dynamics couldn t hit water if they fell out of a boat
if western studios refuse to do tomb raider and other ips correctly  then maybe some japanese studios need to take the reins. they have no problem showing women characters as both strong and beautiful. one doesnt need to be sacrificed for the other.
Ive never been a tomb raider fan  for women I prefer samus aran. for playstation 1 games first of all castlevania symphony of the night is the best of that console. metal gear solid and silent hill follow it. solid snake is the definition of a lone wolf badass.thatsaid  I stand with you on this just because I despise the retcon crap.
she looks likes the newbie tech @ the crime scene
Imiss lara s short shorts. which would come back only if lara is designed into an obese landwhale  but could still do acrobatics and death defying stunts. dont ever be surprised if that happens.
they tried this same crap with samus from metroid in other m. I hope prime 4 stays true to her character.
how is old kick ass lara misogynistic. a thirty something kick ass woman with a wicked sense of humor. her creators loved their creation with all their heart.
I expect nothing less. given the bull they pulled back in the legacy of kain days--the company is still filled with idiots  the only difference is the faces have probably changed.
she is a badass I love classic lara the new games are cool but she doesnt feel like lara but really cool games but the classic are way better
lara in the new games is like a blonde bimbo from a horror flick. only  without the blonde hair or body that would make you give a damn about a helpless idiot in a hopeless situation.I liked the mechanics of the new game trilogy  but I couldn t bring myself to finish the first game. I personally hate what is essentially gore porn and I dont feel inclined to care for somebody sharing lara s name while sharing absolutely nothing else about her.
in the very first game both parents died  and she had to make her own way out of a forest when she was like 12.
I dont want to  relate  to my hero s  I want to look up to them. reboot lara is a failure and they just dont want to come to terms with it. anyone who makes the argument that classic lara was  hyper-sexualized  is just trying to be manipulative and deceptive. male superhero s are ripped   tall and handsome but you dont see people making a fuss about that. classic lara is my hero  there is no other lara.
classic lara is the best. well in the first games. I looked up to her as a child and wanted to be her. I find her solo life with her adventures alluring. new lara is some annoying moaning chihuahua you want slap.
can we get politics out of her video games
you sound like someone thats pissed off at the erasure of an entire childhood happening before their eyes . and no  its not just a fictional videogame character. its passion and memories and all the excitement these characters used to bring. Im 38 and Ive felt the same way for many many years now - I am genuinely fuming and raging seeing what s happening to these once innocent times. everything these days must comply to some racial gender political agenda and its sucking dry all the enjoyment of things that had the simplest task - to entertain us.
lara is the best.
it helped that the design of lara was and is inherently sexy. you cant make a character like lara without sex appeal even if you try.
well I suppose you might as well make a playable character appealing in appearance  because you have to see them for the majority of the game.
oh no  no thatsimply wont do.itseems you have made the mistake of wanting your characters to have character. that is problematic. xd
thats not even true lol
@melonie mac go boom  Imay have to play again. its been many years  and Im getting old. I still have my ps2.
the problem nowadays with female characters is they need to be strong whamen who have little to no weakness but if they do they overcome it with ease. ray  sue  from the star wars sequel is a great example of this. they did the exact opposite for lara. the original lara was a badass but now they made her into an emotional weakling who constantly cries for her daddy.
I grew up with tomb raider .classic lara is still my favorite. kicking atlantic mutants and dinosaur ass. new lara is still whining in the shadow of the tomb raider. old lara would not have been whining. also pissed me of that there were still no duel pistols. I hate the bow!!!
gamers  classic lara looked kick ass!game journos  classic lara  look at those cubes! thats sexism and misogynism!
as much as I like the remake  calling the original tropeish and all that is uncool. its like comparing chris pines kirk and shatners kirk. some people like shatners kirk over pines  and thats fine  he has his qualities. video game related  ready player one. the book is great  the movie is great.  to those who like them  they are both great in their own right and to call one the lesser is of the two is subjective. all four examples are different from their counter parts in their own way which make them great in their own way. so to belittle one is uncool  especially if its from the developer. its like if paramount called shatners kirk the prime example of toxic masculinity. was he  I dont know. the description in that museum shows a lack of descriptive imagination  in that there are better words to describe classic lara than what they used. in fact  the words you used makes me want to get to know classic lara. to pick up the games and invest in learning about classic lara. by the way been a  semI fan since before your gamestop tv days  I know this cause I remember the first time you popped up on thatscreen and I was like  oh wow  I know her   just cant remember from where  want to say thestream.tv   those were some great days
classic lara had bikinI outfits in print and advertising. the prima strategy guide had her in a bikini
maybe Im wrong since Im male. but itseems to me that the changes they made to laura to make her more relatable to  real  women are much more misogynistic than a large bust. so misogyny is a big bust but thinking an insecure  emotional wreck is what  real  women relate to isn t   btw when I said  maybe Im wrong since Im male  doesnt  mean  maybe Im wrong because Im male   just that I dont necessarily know what a women might find relatable  not being one of them myself.
17 52 yes and no. working out can slim your waist  however functional muscle makes your waist thicker than just trimming the fat off it. women typically do not go to the gym to get this kind of a waist  however you do see this in female weightlifters because these muscles are necessary.
you  an take the hits you are strong enough
Im a big fan of the tomb raider reboot and I love how they did her origins story I liked how she was at a weak point in her life and still kept going and never gave up. with that being said the sequels are what disappointed me. I believe after the first game they should have went with her being full of confidence and baddesry there was absolutely no need to make her struggling every two seconds in the sequels. but thats just my opinion and the 2013 reboot will always be my favourite.
metroid other m samus and 2013 reboot lara basically same meanwhile 2d samus and classic lara is badass
from what Ive seen a larger percentage of the woke hating on classic lara are from women themselves. rarely if ever I see a man complaining about classic lara s physique lol.
I feel like reboot lara has absolutely no personality. I thought shadow of the tomb raider was ok  but it was only because it had moments of  taking her power back  gameplay  the oil refinery scene is one example .  I was lenient on it because I felt jill murray was given a dumpster fire to fix. ask any man who played the original trs what they think of lara croft. I bet they ll all tell you   power . this erasure of sexuality in an adult female character is extremely disturbing to me. when rihanna pratchet wrote the first two reboots  the parallels between the new lara and noriko from heavenly sword were uncanny. it was all about daddy issues and victimization. that especially doesnt work with a newer ultraviolent game mechanic. rihanna has since said that the company wanted the  daddy issues  in the game before she was even hired. reading the screen rant article creeped me out.
10 04 tight waist pretty face  with a big bank is what I hear the youngsters say these days.
the complain I have with the new lara series  the ryona. all the Goddamn ryona. and the actual sexual harrassment. so progressive.
nooooooo they never learrrnnn!!  God dammnit!!
I grew up with the first and second lara croft  but never found myself interested in the third lara croft whatsoever. the way I see it  the first and second lara croft  to a degree  are the strong  confident  women who are both no doubt power fantasy characters.but the third lara croft just didn t...feel like I was playing as lara croft. she was too vulnerable  serious  heroic  and ultimately  she was boring. I didn t really care thatshe was trying to save the world  or thatshe was trying to save her friends  or just surviving during a series of environmental disasters in general. she was missing her good old british wit and snark. d you know... its gonna be a real pleasure to shut you up.  is one of my favourite lines from her  for example.what drew me to lara croft in my early years wasn t her sex appeal  though I have no problem with it whatsoever   but her confidence  wit  hedonism  irreverence  and most of all  how her diverse voice actors gave a new life and personality from game to game. I didn t play tomb raider to relate to lara croft  I played tomb raider to watch her breeze through desolate caves  temples  jungles  all in the name of sport and fun.
and thats not even the worst part of this questionable  evolution   gameplay-wise tomb raider anniversary is still the best game in the series so far  the newer ones are just mindless shooty shooty bang bang games  like everything else on the market. I always refer to the 2013 reboot lara as gollum-lara  since she seem to have two personalities. on the one hand she invades an island and is stalking upon the citizens  hammering a pick axe in their backs and then she s crying  like she s the victim in this scenario  make up your mind fake lara  that doesnt make any sense. plus the saw splatter stuff  where you can see her die in a bunch of nasty ways. yeah reboot fans  thats entertaining to see this happen to your young protagonist... classic lara was an adrenaline junky  doing it  for the sports   the first jolie-movie actually portrayed that pretty well  I think  there never were any s xual implications in the first game  its a woman alone in a bunch of caves and  yes  tombs  far off from society  it hardly gets more independant  meeting only four other male characters in the game and the only exchange is shooting  where she always comes on top with no ones help ...if the mob would think for a second  they would love her  but itseems like that already answers that...
being sexy is a sexist trope !
the recent comments by square crystal are cringe for sure. I just dont see anything wrong with their tomb raider games. I thought that they were simply grounded versions of that character. I never once thought I was being manipulated or that they were censoring who that character was. it was all about the tone of the games and adapting their lara to match that tone. they only made 3 of these rebooted games in a span of 5 years. the og lara starred in 10. she clearly had a great run and could easily come back without all of the  not my lara  outrage.
did I just not notice that you have a cat or is this the first time its been on camera
yes Im not referring to marketing materials. even then I dont mind them.
working out can make your shoulders and lats wider and create a more hourglass shape  makes the waist appear smaller because of the ratio is what I am talking about
@melonie mac go boom  it can and in most cases will  im not going to defend what they did to lara because there was no reason go realistic in that way  and yea I think we are talking about two different things  but I believe the added thickness to the waist is something that would realistically be there given what lara does but they didn t need to add it.
I agree! I feel so bad for eidos montreal and jill murray being left to conclude crystal s mess of a trilogy. shadow lara was alright. I think thats where she should have been at the beginning of rise  but cd decided to drag the story out.I recall rhianna saying she had a problem with the father storyline on a radio show shortly after rise s release. its weird crystal would hire a professional writer only to incessantly meddle with their output. I wonder if it played a role in her departure.
the original lara was only in 6 games  after that the series was rebooted twice with crystal dynamics  versions of lara
@mikey.526  sure. I should have worded it better. the three games made before the rebooted series  legend  anniversary  and underworld  were still pretty much in line with the original series. the three  survivor  games were the tonal shift I was referring to.
Ive had him for nearly 13 years  he walks around in the background sometimes haha
@melonie mac go boom  moar kitty cat   moar subs. at least I think thats how the algorithm works...
I love thatsomeone has the balls to say this. as a woman I love old lara  I want her to be feminine and sexy  thats empowering. what is wrong with females looking feminine !
I admit  I really like the new tomb raider games  but I hate them trying to trash the past incarnations in order to prop up their version. the characters and story were honestly the weakest aspects of the reboot trilogy  so it just feels like they re trying to artificially inflate the importance of their bland  cookie-cutter characters.
boom
I love when you have these fragile eggshell people that complain and one of the first things they say is  I think I speak for.... . no  unless youre the head of an organization who s members have discussed and voted on an issue and whom yourepresent  or you ve gone out on your own dime and created a signed petition  you speak for and represent no one but yourself.
boom!God bless!
so now its okay for them to tell women what they should or shouldn t wear  aren t these the same people that are constantly lecturing us about women s rights
misogyny  in tomb raider 1  lara was a female  athletic  gun-toting thrill-seeker with many millions of dollars to her name. meanwhile  her enemies were armed and dangerous men - several of whom aren t even given names - who submitted to the whims of their female employer  a self-made multi-millionaire named  natla   who is lara s greatest foe in the game. lara bests all of them and saves the world. I wouldn t call any of that  misogyny.  these people whine that they want  strong  independent wahmen who dont need no man   but they already have one in lara croft. and yet  they still complain about her somehow.
is it any good tomb raider game on ps2
its a shame how crystal dynamics has ruined tomb raider. tomb raider 3 was the first game I ever played I was 6 years old and that game made me fall in love with gaming as a whole. I ended up playing ever single tomb raider game from 1 2 etc and its truly bad that they ve ruined the image of lara and what she was meant to represent. reboot lara was such a boring character no depth compared to classic lara.
trying to go low key abby arms
just watching this and watching you freak out about this  wasnt there some thing where the guy who designed the original laura was creeping on his sister  and based it off of her as some courtship behavior  maybe their trying to be apologetic about that  and kinda shove that under the rug by trying to downplay her and her body appeal that wayalso sexist tropes  honestly I remember those ads in the 90 s they did with laura there  they did really ramp up those ads  hell I remember they had a full spread for some graphics card back in the day with her  3dvfx  3d voodo fx in one of the old pc mags back in the day  like full on 3d render in a bikinI to sell both the game and the graphics card  which was a big thing with those voodoo cards  they always had half nude women posted over the promo stuff of them  and laura was no exceptionso while its the wrong term  sexist  like someones putting someone down for being a woman  if they were honest  they would say we re kind of embarrased at how games were sold back then with lauras history on her sex appeal alone rather than the games themselveswhich is fair enoughhell honestly I remember trying the demo for laura croft 1 and not doing too well with it and its horrible controls  like even back then they were clunky and really really bad  also no maps  no indicators no nadawhich is probably part of the reason why driving games were so popular back then  and its because the controls were on a completely different level  fluid and worked well   and they gave you a map and told or showed you what to do  while these well  very few people tried to make 3d adventure games like that and itshowedwhich is why tomb raider was the only game in town and pulled in the sales it did  especially in 1997  in no small part to laura s gender being one of the major pulls so its kind of understandable that edios would ramp up the sex appeal and sell the games as well as they did on that  probably realizing hey the controls kinda suck we might wanna pull up the sex appeal to sell these things. as it was the 90 s  it was the edgy thing to do  and games did kinda suck back then  hell 1997 aint too far from 1993 and doom 1 really  which is really kinda incredible to think about really  like how much graphics and games came about and advanced in such short orderwhen all we were doing back in the old old days was looking at some stupid 2d pixels on screen in things like space invaders and the like  hell honestly laura back then really wasnt that memorable to me  jade in interstate 76 now that is a very different matterand she didnt even have a face lol and with 6 10  Jesus Christ  its not sexist  its stupid  like look at her boobs and tell me that is not abit overdone there  like I remember zero punctuation describing her as an ironing board with two balloons stappled to it  and yup  thats not too far off there with her 3d model lol and her render  like Jesus it looks like the difference between the woman who played quiet in real life for mgs5 and what she looked like in game and on that doll they made of her  where they really ramped that up abit lollike dont get me wrong I see what your coming from with the charachter  as honestly I dont remember any of those bits  but the sex appeal  yeah their kinda guilty as charged and then some  and then some ontop of that with that one lol granted that would be far more fun to have in the modern games  as she is kind of a bland sad sack abit  although could be worse  look at that gigantic henchwoman they had in the last of us part iilike atleast this laura s still a woman  and not a man with a womans face rendered to his body.
its really getting to the point where most modern games in general just aren t for me anymore when they continue to bend the knee to the woke mob  I d rather stick with the older games especially tomb raider
at 11 18 its the female version of mcu namorrrrrrr.
its just so funny because I feel like the people against the sexualization of women characters nowadays are guys. it has sort of swapped in a way because I remember there were women complaining about it like 10 years ago. but now all my female friends regardless of political beliefs like sexualized womens characters. its good that women dare making their voices heard because guys are just going to be called perverts and incels etc.
I dare them to tell angelina jolie thatshe was playing a misogynistic character. the movies that used the small things  like a sense of wonder when discovering items. doing reverse somersault gun battle.
crystal dynamics has become a woke joke and frankly I dont want to support this dev in the future. I loved the legend anniversary underworld tr games and cd was one of my favorite devs back then but over the years it has gotten worse and  though its not tomb raider  avengers was a very low point that  in fact I d call it a disgrace. terrible studio compared to what it once was.
man  this sounds just like frustrated star wars fans who aren t feeling disney star wars. and appreciate the Bible verse as usual.
women were dressing that way. buffy the vampire slayer  britney spears  etc.
the terrible 2018 tomb raider film is where they intend to grow new lara croft from  rake thin  no chest  no hips. the most ordinary female body type being the most extraordinary female video game character. what a phase mankind is going thru fighting the woke era.
that laura in all black and a ponytail  makes me think of perfect dark.
but her hair isn t as red.
can we also acknowledge that humans are sexual and ideally everyone in their life gets  sexualized    its a really sad  incel  existence when that never happens to you.  why isn t that considered to be a sometimes good thing that we should approve of in the first place again its one thing if you dont want your character to be seen as nothing more than wank material  but this  sexualization is misogyny  thing isn t just damaging to artists  conceptualizations  it also just doesnt make sense in the first place.
truth be told  I liked all the tomb raiders  but was not a huge fan of angel of darkness and shadow of tomb raider. the original lara croft was more of a morally gray anti-hero. my favorites would be last revelation  tr2  anniversary  and 2013. imo classic lara has a stronger personality  but I still think the 2013 game made her badass because of how she brutally kills the enemies. she is more emotional  but I did not really care. anyways  I do think all the woke nonsense is silly. side note  crystal dynamics need to bring back legacy of kain!!
the netherlands is actually my sister from another mr. s side of the world. sweet!
how does every major corporation end up pushing this woke bs  this is clearly organized and Im at the point of just letting all this beloved franchises die in my mind. we gonna need to just build new characters and make new franchises of our own.
go boom baby!
I really enjoyed the crystal dynamics games  but I will not stand for this slander of the og lara.
I dont really see new lara as  woke . I also hate that woke has become a negative thing. but whatever. but she definitely is a people pleaser. I was hesitant when I clicked on the video but the text on the wall is pretty bad. the only sexist part of classic lara was maybe the sexualized marketing that was pushed in the 90s. not the game itself. although there were some weird moments both in the game and the marketing with young lara. no one can deny that. why didn t they just talk about classic lara without highlighting anything negative  seems like they re just harming themselves. otherwise I would say you def have a bias with new lara and I feel like youre exaggerating a little bit because of but thats just my observation. take it with a grain of salt. the proportions are literally fine and the outfits are fine  except for the weird native outfits  I think her design in shadow is great. and she does not look androgenous at all. very confused by thatstatement.
if lara was a smoker  I think she would smoke virginia slims 120s.
here s how I think of it  I  as a man  play as kratos so I can feel like the God of war  not a peasant. I play swtor  so I can feel like a sith  jedI  han solo type  etc...  not a storm trooper. the list goes on  is it really that unimaginable that women would play games for similar reasons  our society doesnt need  fixing  when all the efforts to do so only drag us back to archaic  and faux-puritan norms.
tomb raider was my childhood game I play them on ps1 and ps2 loved them rebut hit  I was was like cool... then I played it... returned thatshitsooo fast and havent looked into tomb raider since. I hate the new stuff sooo much. if people like it thats fine im not one of them
finally  something to take my mind off the bizarre russian-chinese misinformation campaign about the ukraine war.
the problem with pandering to the wokes is they dont buy things  we buy the franchises we enjoy  star wars  dr who  lotr  and yes tomb raider  because we are fans. however  the more they butcher our memories the less we will buy. so they will crash and burn. I dont want to see this because I want more tomb raider.
my tomb raider is ada wong from resident evil 4   I simp . tomb raider should be super hawt but hey the modding community is very strong !
woke  doesnt fix  it breaks. woke should be renamed  broken  and dubbed the broken religion for the broken.
why do we need a masculine lara croft if we have a nathan drake ! I thought the thing about lara croft was thatshe was a girl.
why no-one creates a game with a hot female character in the spirit of original tomb raider is beyond me. it ll make bank from all those wanting to shaft modern day gaming.new tomb raider has good gameplay but bland lara. and its not even her looks that make her bland.
I believe crystal and square are distancing themselves from the classics because reboot was highly successful and sold way more that the classics. besides most of the online classic tr fans are trump supporters and pick me girls so I think they dont want that tarnishing the franchise. thats my take. I could be wrong. but Im never wrong.
is classic lara bodytype realistic  type caroline girvan to search and look.
reboot lara is a clumsy whiner  who trips and stumbles and falls over everything  with daddy issues. classic lara was agile  confident  bad a  . in the later games they made her a bit cold  but she didn t start that way. guys and girls loved her. reboot lara went from struggling to kill an animal for food to a mass murderer  but because she cries all the time  she is more relatable  I dont think so. I also think the hate on classic lara for having curves and being attractive and sexy should be insulting to curvy  attractive and sexy women. guess what  they actually exist in the real world  my wife is one of them  and she cosplays as classic lara.
you keep calling new lara  people pleaser ... but I think you mean to call her  political pleaser
they even turned kratos into a babysitter
they turned him into a father...
@angry yeti  exactly  but we didn t play God of war to be raising a kid as a single father... it was a fantasy about being a total badass God killing other Gods.they took  kratos is daddy  too literally
@clever man  have you forgotten that kratos  story started with him being forced to murder his wife and child  it was the source of his rage  and after having killed zeus his vengeance was complete. having no more bones to pick  it only makes sense that he would  bury his axe   sword   as many a soldier has  and start another family. that would have been the end of it if the norse Gods hadn t poked the bear. nothing was taken away from the kratos experience  and unlike almost every other game that has had an npc follow you everywhere  the kid did a damn good job of staying out of your way. bottom line kratos has no fury  without first having love. he doesnt fight because of what s been done to him  but rather what s been done or will be done  to those he loves. I dont know about you  but thats a character I can relate to.
the classic games grossed monumentally more profit than any of the reboot games ever dreamed of. tr2013 sold a little bit more but had 100x the budget. also who gaf what politics any of the fans have  thats irrelevant.
@melonie mac go boom  they stated in an official blog that rise of the tr with lara s realistic proportions and baggy winter clothes is the most profitable title of the entire series. tr is a media franchise from a pr point of view its important to not be known to have fans that have conservative and backward view on women  it will erase all the good they ve been doing. thats why I believe they wont ask you to promote the next game since yourevealed that you have misogynistic view on women and sexualisation. I hope the incels engagements on your social media are enough I really do.
shadow of the tomb raider is the only tomb raider game that I haven t bought yet. if I ever do  I will buy it used to avoid funding crystal dynamics. another company run by self righteous  woke narcissists.
an hourglass figure is sexist  as a man will not have such a body. it is not misogynistic  though  if anything  its the opposite.  sexism  isn t bad  its only a way of thinking that involves gender.I wear shorts in the winter. I haven t even bothered to play the second two games of the new trilogy. the first game was too unimpressive. I bought them  at a discount  because I liked some of the things they were doing  such as having the difficulty be customizable. however  I have rarely had any desire to play them.
facts
...classic lara was an  ice queen . she was a stone cold bitch  and an amazing character. I dont see refering to her as an ice queen as a negative  just a statement. the sexist comment I can understand  while Ivery much disagree with it. classic lara has long been a pretty controversial figure.
commenting to feed the algorithm
I agree with your sentiment  but as a fan who got into tr through the reboot series I honestly find no issue with the new games except that they couldn t keep lara s design consistent from tr 2013. I am fine with her being  realistic  and  girl next door type.  I am not viewing it from a lens that lara has to be this or has to be that like in the old games. I am content with her design and I think she is extremely beautiful and strong character. however  you are correct of a lot of woke agendas in games these days and I feel this has hindered tr quite a bit even in narrative terms.
classic lara would sacrifice herself to save the world. reboot lara sacrifices white men to save herself.
cant wait 2 c u go live on twitch again missing u I need 2 talk 2 u please go on twitch
I dont think these woke clowns know what misogynistic or sexist actually means. if anything they are the ones being sexist  because clearly they are the ones who hate the female form. why else would they keep making female video game characters more and more masculine  the woke movement is just sexism hiding behind virtue signalling while calling everyone else sexist. if this is the way crystal dynamics and square enix is going then I will not support the next game. I will no longer tolerate this nonsense. my new years resolution is to not support any game developer or publisher that panders to the woke cult.
these fake fans   fake gamers are really startin  to piss me off
ever sense crystal dynamics took over tomb raider I havnt been in love with a tomb raider game sense. I havnt been able to love it like I did with the first 6 games and thats because its not even the same character. a character I desperately miss so much. tomb raider hasn t been the same and Ive waited all these years for the real lara to come back and she hasn t and Im so sick of them for doing this. when they get tomb raider taken away from them or are done with the franchise they will go down in history as the company that destroyed and tried to change one of the most iconic and inspiring characters ever created and someday we will learn that keeping her the way she was is all that was ever needed. thats why she succeeded from day one and built a huge fan base. sure they made decent games but doesnt mean they made a decent tomb raider games staring lara croft. they have exactly everything they need to make an amazing tomb raider game but all they keep doing is trying to keep changing tomb raider and lara croft and they jus fail over and over again and by the third game they make  it needs to be rebooted again. why aren t they jus taking this sexy  inspiring  and motivational character on more and more adventures thatshe does for herself and for sport. the lara from the first 6 games inspired me. to be fit  active  stay healthy  do acrobatics and climb  have confidence  stand up for myself. legend lara did that a little but I hated the fact they changed her character in that game and the ones to follow and I felt embarrassed by it. the newest lara even since legend and especially the last 3 games is embarrassing me even more and hasn t interested me at all and hasn t inspired or motivated me in any way to enjoy life more  have fun  to be happier. by charging her character ur telling us its not ok to be who you are and you must conform to social standards like sheep. bring back the lara from the first 6 games! she is the one that inspired everyone.
as a trans woman  classic lara was the embodiment of the woman I wanted to be. a powerful  feminine force and things like her appearance and outfit choice were all just secondary to me. she never sought validation from anyone but herself and again  as a trans woman. these are subconscious messages that were a must during my personal development. I dont aspire to be like reboot lara. constantly pandering to her father and other male figures. this isn t a strong female protagonist  its an insecure and actually misogynistic take on what misogynists believe woman are!! classic lara is progressive. classic lara is feminism and cd completely robbed her of everything that made her this towering enigma.
just say u want classic lara back
girl  I get that your upset  but there s no need to tear down crystal dynamics first attempt at lara.she had a great design in legend  she wasnt   stretched   nor did she have   silicone    it was simply an idealized female form.people who took over the franchise with the 2013 reboot seem to slander legend - underworld lara aswell  its not just core s classic lara that they take issue with.
your obsession with lara croft is a tad funny. just make this the lara croft Bible verse channel. lol
a bigot is someone who ignorantly maintains a dogmatic stance beyond reason. Im pretty sure you know this franchise much better than the sjws..
I think lara croft from the new games has a very feminine figure  I seriously dont know what youre talking about. we get it  you like lara the way she was originally depicted  but the body specifically  a strong body can come in all forms  and you pointing out the absence of the typical hourglass figure  that every female character had back in the day  as a way to demonstrate that its not strong looking  its not feminine anymore and its not how bodies look after attending gym  what kind of ignorance is that  alicia vikander worked out endlessly for her role in the movie  and still never achieved a small waist  but her torso looked incredibly strong nevertheless  is honestly embarassing. she does have a small waist in the reboot games  not a cinderella level one  but still a small waist. youread a comment saying you dont need to bring the classic lara down in order to bring the new lara up but youre doing the same thing the other way around. I love the old games because lara knows who she is  a confident  smart  strong woman. I love the reboot as well because they show how she got there  through mistakes and hardship and lots of character development. I think you are closed minded and I dont think the way original lara croft was depicted was sexist  a little unrealistic because who would wear a short top and shorts  leaving so much skin exposed on highly dangerous adventures   but from the way youre talking  you seem to have some internalized misogyny going on.
liberal dude here  one line from the reboot tomb raider was when lara croft said I hate tombs. what the hell
its jealousy  pure   simple
sorry not sorry  but I didn t hear half the video because I was staring at your chonky kitty burrowing into your elbow
lol no classic lara would not. she was never driven to help people or be some hero. she did what she wanted for the thrill of it and that was it.
Ive made that abundantly clear
@melonie mac go boom  thats true atleast ur voicing ur opinion ... but while I have u here  do u as a fan fear for the future of tomb raider or are u happy with the direction the series is going in... Im genuinely curious ... because u have seen lara throughout all her era s
he s a show stealer
they defintely dont speak for the whole community  lara croft is being underappreciated and unfulfilled. the reboot was a great idea but it just went downhill from there.
it never notifies me when you go live
seriously I wouldn t be surprised if anita sarkeesian or zoey quinn wrote this trash. we re dealing with major hypocrisy and I wonder what toby gard has to say in all of this.
they try to make laura more woke by making her get beat up and cry. I dont get it. they did this with samus too right  also indy game designers go hire melonie to design a badass female protagonist
I hate new lara.. original is relatable lol I am a gym girl and og lara always inspired me to have muscles... not the itsy bitsy zero character new lara
I guess Im unrealistic cus I have huge breasts   a small waist.we should honestly issue complaints to this exhibition. this is so wrong.
if you want a sexualized character check out rayne from bloobrayne. now thats a sexualized female.
the wokesters will come for nathan drake next
new lara doesnt even use dual pistols ffs  yeah lets get rid of the braid and dual pistols aka the entire trademark. 2013- era are ok adventure games but Imiss playing as the action hero I bought the game for.

their view of classic lara is actual misogyny..  ice queen  really
next lara croft will have hair blue hair  overweight  vegan  and gender neutral. xd
I dont understand why they re viewing the characters with a political pov chill bro its just fiction lara is comical  none of her characteristic are real people liked her bcuz she provided them an escape from reality she had something they were missing.
they gave her a boys figure... thats what you are trying to say.
shadow of tomb raider lara reminds me a little bit to abby from last of us 2 if she would have been borned woman       no offense to anyone tho  you do you ofc
btw nintendo switch is giving us tomb raider n second best you forgot about samus
do this ppl know there are a lot hot chicks out there with curves right
I prefer old school lara mainly because she was a bad as female character the was very feminine in how she presented her self and pulse she stayed kicking ass
but classic lara did have vulnerability when she d face loss like she did in the comics when she lost chase her boyfriend and had to get over that. these  progressives  always want to be recognized as the  first  to do things but in reality they ve already been done years ago
original lara - badass  focused  determined. powerful. witty.new lara - whining  child-like demeanor  boring
this wasn t live  it was prerecorded. did it not show up in your sub box  do you have the bell notification on
they already did in uncharted 4 and itshowed
I liked 4 but man that fight with nadine was sjw moment
the comics messed up her backstory too and the love interests were dumb. lara croft in the classic games was an unattainable power fantasy - should have stayed that way
@melonie mac go boom  yeah... if youre saying the games had her be disowned we could say the comics messed it up since it just talks of the plane crash killing them there and her honoring her parents throughout supposedly. not sure why the comics changed her at all honestly  at least not at that time when people weren t really complaining about lara s character.
by sexist features  do they mean latino features she was  latino  then changed to english but they kept the look
I dont think there are very many rational people left on twitter. it might be time to abandonthe platform.
to all game developers listen to this video   reading this comment  let me whisper something to your ears  come a little closer  closer  closer  closer  closer  ahem stop listening to feminists   stop letting them be a ceo of anything!!!!!
the old lara is hot and gen z needs to get over it and get a hobby cuz fake outrage is not a hobby its an addiction to anger. they know they have issues why do you think they list them in their twitter bios....its a shield so you cant criticize them.
darrell gallagher ruined tomb raider with thatsurvivor trilogy bs art style. he was studio head at the time and daniel neuburger was game director.this was top-down management which only gallagher and neuburger had something to say about the survivor reboot. just look what happens to perfect dark at the initiative now  same shit over again from darrell gallagher.
they made superman gay they can do anything they want just dont consume it.
kitty!!!!!
the world would be a much better place if the woke crowd wasn t put above everyone else.
they just vanilla s her as a female uncharted game mechanic but used her name to suck out identification and sales to gain the extra bucks in hype of a retro come back.  in name only  like everything else leeching 70-90s culture today.
attractive people exist.
sucks that uncharted has better puzzles than the reboot tomb raider games
the need for everything to be  relatable  these days is so annoying.
you speak the truth to evil. oh my by now you know the demon oppressed possessed people that will come after you! keep your self prayed up  and God will protect you! God bless you  my sister in Christ. you are like my youtube daughter. lol. you are reaching more young people for Jesus then you know.
these people wont be happy until they turn lara into a 6 foot 5 transgender man. cause then lara will be strong and independent and dont forget finally she will be feminine and sexy. keep up the great work.
do these fake fans play any of these games  no
you mean fake fans
sexist tropes and unrealistic !  the hell  so is angelina jolie a sexist trope and have an unrealistic body also  does she exist  lol
yes  please make lara croft reflect the average modern american woman  pure 200 lb of  health and beauty why have heroic-superhuman standards to strive towards  and exercise to be healthy and fit  when you sit  complaint and eat burgirs
sexist tropes    beautiful realistic form    ugly
these fake gamers   fake fans
great verse as well btw  highly applicable today.
I like the reboot games for gameplay but I would play uncharted over them
I ll take sexist trope lara croft over whiny woke lara anyday. I like what epic games did with her when they introduced her into fortnite. they have the reboot lara  then they have a merged version of reboot lara and classic lara  which is pretty hot  not gonna lie   and then they have fully classic lara. also they made sure that each version of the skin looks like a sexy lara and not a man. wokies need to just go away and stay away from things.
classic lara s misogynistic............... no one crystal dynamincs  hey naughty dog!!naughty dog  yeah sup bro  cd   you mind if we make a game like yours   slap the tomb raider ip on it  nd  na bro  you think maybe we could use a heroine type like lara on steds throw her in with some zombies   kill the other main male character of with her cd  cool with us bro  crrrrack on!!!classic lara was harder  better  more mysterious more precise than what we have now    she actually raided tombs.
so they get to be sexist and body shame females of specific body types
caaaaaaaaaaaat
oh hell no! youre the boomer  lady!!!
reboot lara is so bland and generic she could be an npc in any game  think what you will about aloy but she is atleast a character thatstands out  and doesnt cry all the time.
I send love .
reboot andies
this is strangely asmrish. dont judge.
from feminine to dowdy  cause cant have pretty women these days. -_-
I hate the cowards who say they think the same  but can say it publicly!  if they didn t keep their mouths shut  then the small vocal wokies would not be able to drowned out the effing majority!
reboot laura wasn t even woke when the reboot game first came out. I would say reboot laura isn t even woke at all. then you get stuff like this which wants to try and change that. I hope the tomb raider franchise stays dead for a long while. I dont think anyone should make another game considering the social climate we re in.
my question what is the point the extremists liberals are trying to do like turn the Lord of rings into woke if this makes sense  and turning classic lara croft into something thatshe is not.
I really  dislike the reboot lara   they try so hard to make her this strong female character thatshe comes across as a complete idiot.and dont get me started on fatboy jonah and his nonexistant personality I will always love the classic tr games
its like these people complaining of sexism are the most sexist themselves   an attractive lady cant be empowering ...because they think so little of attractive women  they want to identify with characters on games... who just happen to never be fit attractive or even average at this point.we play fantasy games because they are a fantasy.. and if your fantasy is to play a game going to get some extra milk from the grocery store while your wheezing from asthma and your clothes dont fit right then go make that game as for most of us we want the fantasy   we want to be the impossibly muscly guy or impossibly proportioned girl who can do crazy things..as its a fantasy.the quartering got me here and I subbed after the first video  keep ranting melonie you got this
6 26bikinis  no. revealing outfits  yes.I dont like the woke crap either  but come on.
trying to compare new lara and classic  lara is dumb. your complaint is like comparing batman  year one and two to seasoned batman. both versions of lara are good each focus s on different stages of evolution of her growth and experience.
weird.   the new games look like torture pawn to me...  way worse
nathan drake personality is closer to classic lara than reboot lara  meanwhile reboot tomb raider is a copy of uncharted gameplay. why even bother with reboot tomb raider  you either play pre-reboot games for the actual lara or uncharted for the superior game experience.
woke is a joke...  immature children pretending to be grown ups. ...
oftenly mindlessly tho .
.
gotta run
reboot lara is extremely woke and was designed to be that way from day 1. read the promo articles and interviews  its disgusting.
feminism destroys everything it touches
almost forgot to comment
the reboot sucks
the defeminizing    of female characters is extremely disturbing
hey  I just found out why your getting low hit on rumble. there s a fake account using your name and has more subs then your real and is re-uploading your videos. there always two videos behind your real channel. you should probably look in to it. also   this is crystal dynamics way of shaming and gaslighting the original fan in the accepting there lara croft as the real lara croft. if you dont like there lara croft then  your just hates women and have unrealistic experience and if you a woman then your just a self hating women. the only way to not hate women in there eyes is to hate the original lara croft.  which is all you need to know that they hate lara croft and prefer fan fiction lara croft.
yet people will say wap is empowering. but classic lara is misogynistic  weird. very weird
male feminists make me laugh
sorry  how is lara croft supposed to be  relatable    even reboot lara is part of the 1 percent of 1 percent. she is part of the cream. that immediately takes away  relatable . original lara is better precisely because she knows is part of the privilege 1 percent and doesnt spend her games trying to pretend to be normal when she knows she is not. lame.
same people that will tell you video games and music wont influence people to act accordingly. well what are you worried about misogyny for then
I am like 666 of this video
boomers
the new designs are so bland and forgettable not really something you would display proudly on a poster or figurineid say a reboot is inevitable
well  Im first
youre not going to want to hear this but shadow of the tomb raider lara was the villian. she  a british woman  stole an indigenous artifact. in doing so she caused a massive natural disaster that killed the entire population of a native village.a man from the tribe she stole it from then took it back from her  told her she caused this disaster because she didn t understand what it was she took  and then spared her life and left. lara  narcicist thatshe is  and with a complete lack of self awareness  then swears to get revenge on him.she then spends the rest of the game gleefully murdering dozens of innocent security guards for doing their job before once again stealing the native artifact from its indigenous owner and killing him.if she had just gone home at the start of the game literally nothing bad would have happened to anyone.
did you played forza horizon  they got neutral pronouns yeah fucking neutral pronouns.
. played the original couple of tomb raiders when they came out  and did my best to get ahold of the top cow comics  this sound like some woke crap from people who probably never played the originals nor read the comics. if modern day npcs have their way all women would wear 8th century middle east garb.
my trans friends are upset too  they love classic. 4th wave feminists are wack. gloria steinem and the other 70 s women dont recognize them at all. 50  of michael turner s fans are women.
classic lara will always be amazing  but I dont see the reboot lara as being woke at all  its lara when she was starting out to be an explorer and tomb raider  you think she went out one day and was just automatically amazing at hunting  climbing  killing and surviving    hell no  she had to start somewhere  and then she gradually became  classic lara  that could raid tombs with her eyes closed and head shotted people with her pistols like it was nothing. I hate everything in this world that is labeled  woke   woke ppl are literally the worst  but Ive never seen reboot lara as woke in the rebooted video games. I thought you were only talking about the idiot ppl who comment dumb shit about classic lara  but then you started shit talking reboot lara and thats where you lost me. this entire video is multiple contradictions  youre saying reboot lara is woke  but then youre pointing out that crystal dynamics was giving her more revealing bikinI s and dresses. I agree with a lot of what youre saying but there s a lot that just isn t true as well.
