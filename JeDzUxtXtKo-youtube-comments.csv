the opinions of journalists can be safely ignored a large percentage of the time. nobody should feel bad  guilty  or uninformed for doing so. you ll be none of those things.
as far as I know  ghost of tsushima only had positive response in japan.the japanese haven t swallowed the dumb  cultural appropriation  pill like western pundits have  so when they see a western studio making the effort of representing japanese culture and history  they re happy about it.as most of us normal people would be.its like  Im scandinavian  so when I see games and films delving into the history of the norse and the vikings  even if its not historically correct all the time  I feel happy that this part of my people s history is being brought to the forefront for a larger audience to explore and enjoy.
a japanese studio could probably make a kickass western cowboy game.just look at the original cowboy bebop anime.while its more of a sci-fI setting  the western elements are really predominant.also  there s been a huge crossover between the western genre and old samuraI films in the past. like how the akira kurosawa film yojimbo had its script taken to make the clint eastwood film a fistful of dollars.the samuraI trope and the western gunslinger trope in fiction are really similar. so I have complete faith that there s plenty of japanese creators that would totally get what makes a good western story and setting.
these individuals are never happy regardless of how much corporations try to pander to them. it ll never be enough. lol
never pander to progressives because its never good enough. thats been the rule for like 10 years.also ghosts of tsushima is a western developed game that accurately brings a past age of japan to life  and if I recall they also helped fund a restoration of the real tsushima gate in japan.progressives are the worst people in the world. they dont know what they re talking about and they project their own bigotry on everyone else. the sooner outlets like this go out of business and real enthusiast press takes their place  the better.edit  I forgot that the devs of ghosts of tsushima were named ambassadors. that alone should shut up anyone complaining about it  but I guess idiots will cry about anything.
when the article says there s no jackie chan-esque slapstick in sifu  there s literally a joke move called  mighty calbot   an easter egg from the dev s previous game   where you can lightly slap your opponent upside the head  much to their confusion in the middle of a beat-down. thats it  no damage. this tells me they didn t actually play the game  or at least not enough of it to opine on it.
reminder  the devs of ghost of tsushima were made ambassadors by the people of tsushima
never let these game journalists get to you. they re all idiots and the most racists people alive. the reason  they literally only see race and gender. nothing else. you as an entertainer talk about the pros and cons of games youre into  they talk about the cons of white people  and thats it. thats why people like me watch your stuff and others like it cause I feel like I get nice opinions from you and nothing from them. like you Im native american but look white if the sun s not out. so naturally Im treated as trash on a daily basis by those people. if they just acted more like you they might be valued. but they re not. thats why we love your content and stick by you. dont stop being you.
thatstream was so much fun glad I was able to catch it! we absolutely crushed that goal! ghost was done beautifully they really did a good job capturing the culture and nice gfuel sweater! good merc plus a beautiful woman a boomin combination
dont apologize to these people. dont try to placate these people.it will only be seen as a sign of weakness and they will attack you even more. its like chumming the water  attracting more sharks.
hey melonie  love your videos. Im a bit of a sissy and mostly play videogames on normal mode  and especially fire emblem I only played on normal and casual. your coverage regarding difficulty in games have finally pushed me to try and play awakening on hard and classic. I still have to play awakening and echoes to prepare my fifth fire emblem three houses run I want to play on maddening and classic. I feel like I can finally push myself to play these games the way they re supposed to be played  so thank you  even though I already am annoyed by the rng in the game  yikes also  your voice is rather cute  so dont worry about that
I remember playing a game as a kid where you were an italian plumber chasing after a princess from either a giant guerrilla or a giant lizard made by a japanese company.a few weeks ago a company that usually makes european aethetic styled games from japan made another entry into their souls like experience. huge success as always.a korean mmo that launched recently has a heavy european art design as well as western creatures. its had millions of players all over the world.my point in all that is  an outside view of your culture history can be amazing. seeing what other creative minds can come up with can be truly spectacular. Imean look at link. does anyone not think botw is one of the best games of the 2010 s. japanese developers and european art and aethetics with a sexy twist of imagination. pure gaming bliss. f most journos for always being devisive. never trying to bring communities together unless  whining  about difficulty settings and   other nonsense for the most part. usually they suck at writing and at video games.
their take on representation is similar to people opening mexican or chinese restaurants event though the owner isn t hispanic or chinese. it doesnt matter. we are honoring the original. these fools are using fake outrage to further their own career and fame.
the problem is gamers are usually busy playing games and if the title isn t good we just move on to play something better. thats why channels like yours are important. voices of people playing games talking about games is worth a lot more than most of the stuff jurnos put out. we kinda let the infestation happen because people were busy actually doing the hobby instead of bitching about games on twitter 12h  a day. and now we suffer the consequences.
I hate that game journalists have the need to put down other games  when you could just say  ghostwire tokyo is a good game  and leave it at that.
remember  these same people had problems when the japanese development team that worked on super mario odyssey put mario into a poncho and sombrero and made the desert world reminiscent of el dia de los muertos--which actual mexican people absolutely loved. never bow down before the fake God of  cultural appropriation .
melonie  you probably get this a lot  but you ve inspired me to finally get myself in shape. thank you for that  and may the Lord continue to bless you.
hey melonie  random question out of the blue... do you at times struggle being single in your 30 s  and if so  how do you handle the  down  days  any advice  im 34 and havent been in a serious relationship for over 6yrs and I really struggle sometimes coping with lonliness and bitterness at times. im also a God-serving Christian man  who is devoted to my Lord
this just makes me want to buy this game as soon as my ps5 shows up next week
mel mac for queen of the galaxy!!
exactly.  they have been garbage for awhile now.  I totally gave up on even looking at the overall scores for games after what they did to days gone
the gaming community and developers no longer need these fools  I rather get my gaming info from actual content creators or better yet do the research myself and make my own informed opinions.
@bloodlust hunter  thats why gaming journalists struggle for money and stuff now. lots of them dont even play games.  with streamers now u can see someone actually play it and see what they think of the game. like u have streamers who are fighting game streamers or souls games. having people like that whole love those genres and games is what a lot of people will look at for opinions now
I dont understand how they seem to get enough readers to read their garbage in order to earn a living.
and the fun fact is that  the mayor of tsushima island actually loved how the game represents most of the island s history and the culture  he decided to made the game devs as their permanent ambassador to the island
@tfgenobatssasin 17  also one of the shines in the island got rehabilitated simply because of the popularity caused by ghost of tsushima
japanese studios do a lot of western-inspired games universes. they never aim to be realistic or authentic  since its more interesting to add your own flavor to it  to make the game as fun as possible and as good as possible.so japanese people really cant understand all this crap about  cultural appropriation   only a western and mentally ill mind can  as it makes no fucking sense to begin with. how can you expect people to be creative if they have to always be 100  authentic  there s nothing authentic about castlevania  valkyrie profile or fate stay night  but thats why all those licences have their own identity. its what art is all about to begin with  appropriating stuff to create something unique.
@xenotypos  quick example is resident evil. its made by capcom  a japanese company. and just by looking and playing the game  we can get the same feeling as if we are in a classic american horror movie.
I still remember a few years ago when a  celebrity  youtuber streamer  I cant remember what she was exactly  wore a kimono and the western media was calling her racist and a cultural appropriator for it  only for the japanese governement and its people to come out and say how happy they were thatsomeone in the west was wearing a kimono and spreading some of the japanese culture to the west.
@xenotypos  I saw a hilarious satire article a while back titled  people who fight cultural appropriation are my spirit animal   that had this white girl talking about how bad cultural appropriation is while using as many terms and concepts from other cultures as humanly possible. it was great.
yea I agree . dont care what the people are making a game or movie if its good
I have thing  yay  wah  changed thing  awww  ...you want thing   no  not interested
they recognize any concession as a weakness to be further exploited.
they have to have a cause  something to protest and fight against
from what ive heard  the real tsushima gate was funded by the fans when it was destroyed by flood. action speaks louder than words
@tfgenobatssasin 17  real fans  paying customers that raised funds to help is a disaster.outrage mob   we have not  nor ever will be  paying customers. and we demand you cater to our bullying!
if I ever play sifu  Im gonna be an ancient skeleton quick from slapping enemies repeatedly until my character is being killed while I roll on the floor laughing til my ribs are sore. xd
most game journos barely get past the tutorial.
wow  if only you watched the video you d know she brings that up and we dont need a  reminder !
try 5x crisis strength on stellaris. thatshould be fun. if youre feeling extra masochistic  make them spawn as early as possible
@john dodo  hold on. I agree with you  but isn t jeans invented by a jewish guy levI strauss  he s not exactly a white man since he s jewish  though jeans were so popular among miners who were mostly white men.
wait a minute  mel mac  melmac   mel knows alf confirmed!!
10 41 - Im not sure if this would apply  but I remember playing a game called samuraI western on the ps2 awhile back.  it was a game starring an anime powered samuraI that was fighting gun-toting cowboys in the wild west ages.
when game or movie show journalists start losing their minds about something  I find thatsomething to be rather well-made and enjoyable. usually like clockwork.
they are right  there is a representation problem in ghostwire. because the moment the subtitles translated the main characters original japanese utterance of           .    saa  dou darou na.    which translates to roughly  meh  who knows   with the phrase  all property is theft  kid.   you knew the localization team put their own politics in the game. consequently  you now have to at least suspect that every bit of japanese culture  mythology etc that is presented in the game is shown through a western  socialist lens that is divergent from the original japanese writers  creation  voice and vision. and that  I agree  is a problem.  edited for spelling .
I was considering picking up ghostwire but wason the fence it looks fun but wasn t sure if its my style. Im looking up more reviews now but I love it when I can add just to piss off the woke crowd to my list of reasons to get it lmao
its funny how they praise other countries for highlighting their cultural influences  but lose their shit if that is done in an american setting.
melonie s new catchphrase  ok journo
this reminds me of the time alyssa wong tried to cancel cb cebulskI because he once used a japanese pseudonym. here s the problem. cb cebulskI lived in japan. he is married to a japanese woman. he speaks fluent japanese. alyssa wong is chinese american.
they are not journalists  they are critics
I feel about batman the way melonie feels about lara both work better as loner s without the endless technology or the entourage of endless sidekicks.Imiss the dark gothic vampire like early classic batman who fits perfectly in the universal monster s universe the same way Imiss the bad ass classic lara.
imagine if the journos went to tokyo and started preaching wokeness. instant social pariah status.
game  journo s  to a tea. whaaaa! representation!  and 5 mins later.  how dare they diversify!  this is just game  journo s  trying to stay relevant. they make these articles to get clicks but the only reason they dont get clicks unless they make these articles is because everyone leaves them because they make these articles. a true chicken vs the egg dilemma. Ive just moved along and just ignore their rants.oh and loved you on fnt!
keep the good content coming!
congrats on raising money!  d
about japanese western genre games  I know a good one  the lone ranger by konamI  nes  1991. there are more.
the last time ghost of tsushima was in the news   the journos were mad it was selling well in japan
should we talk about how much fun this game is    nah  let s objectify it and find little bits and pieces we can complain about.  game journalism  ladies and gentlemen.
there have been a few asian cowboy movies. jackie chan shanghaI noon and shanghaI knights was a play on asian western and there are a few others out there. I think it would be kind of funny to see one as a game though. I dont mind some of the tongue-in-cheek mockeries though.
why is it that when I hear  unhappy person  I immediately think woke person or a gaming journo    they always find something to make themselves miserable .
saw you for the first time on friday night tights and you were awesome! I subbed to both your channels
I do not need to be represented. a setting is meaningless if you shoehorn yourself into it. might as well be a fanfiction.
its like this if a western studio does a asian culture game and does it correctly in the most respected way they get hate for it from the western media journalist but if a western game developer a game based on western culture like european they still get heat from western media and saying how come there s no black folks or anyone else even though the game is based in 700 ad
and who can forget about the greatest western game of all time  rising zan - the samuraI gunman. who doesnt love a  super ultra sexy hero!
fromsoftware is japanese and they ve done pretty well for the medieval european aesthetic in dark souls and elden ring. but yeah  a japanese cowboy rpg would be pretty cool.
this is the same sort of reception I received at a well-known fantasy sci-fI writer s convention back in 2016  and the attitude has only gotten worse in subsequent years 1. we  nyc-based publishers  need more diverse representation in the story worlds. no more european-based cultures and societies. pick another geographical ethnic cultural area to base your main characters and kingdoms on  and go to town.2. we  nyc-based publishers  also dont want anyone white writing about these characters because that would be appropriation.so 1   2   people like me need not apply. its no longer about telling a captivating story. its about an agenda  and that agenda must be pushed above all else.its one of many reasons Ive gone the indie route  to avoid all this. I ll write about what I want to write about and set it wherever and however I please. its as you said  melonie  anyone can--and should--be able to create anything based off anything  provided its not done in a mocking way. there is so much we can learn from neighboring or even ancient cultures  and in an alternate earth or secondary world setting multiple cultures can be blended together in new and unique ways. its one of the things that makes fantasy and sci-fI so fascinating and fun.
it is not the critic who counts  not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles  or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. the credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena  whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood  who strives valiantly  who errs  who comes short again and again  because there is no effort without error and shortcoming  but who does actually strive to do the deeds  who knows great enthusiasms  the great devotions  who spends himself in a worthy cause  who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement  and who at the worst  if he fails  at least fails while daring greatly  so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.  theodore roosevelt
this is why I just play games I like  or want to like  although the ones I want to like I dont stick with indefinitely.
look at the right side of that article. there s an advertisement for ghostwire. thats why the article comes off as an advertisement  and why they have to cut the other games down. they re being paid by the publisher  but they also get to get in those woke points by shitting on other similar games.
did you see how they got mad at sucker punch when they first introduced the game  they had a white guy playing traditional japanese flutes and they got mad because he was white! plaot twist  the guy studied for years  like 1 2 his life  and is considered  iirc  one of the last masters of that instrument.
you rocked on fnt!
im buying this game now.
btw pick up ghostwire. its super fun and Im loving it. both elden ring and ghostwire are the most fun I had in years.
Ive never watched a movie and thought  that actor isn t my race  so I cant enjoy it.  thats a selfish mindset. we dont need representation!!
games with too much realism beats the purpose of it being fun.
so what happens when a japanese company makes a game based off midwestern culture people via silent hill  I rest my case.
journalists should now be referred to as  jour - no - lists.    nuff said....
damn  if they ain t happy it must be good
I remember when they went crazy over the live action cowboy bebop netflix show...
its hilarious because ghost of tsushima got incredibly high marks from japanese people.
I always say  if the game was respectful   the japanese people are not offended  note for got they praised the game  then all is good  these journos should follow the same metric. plus jackie chan makes his own movies and stunts   so how canthey be offended by someone liking his movies
itseemed like their main complaint was it wasn t stereotypical enough.
when you dont have the skill or the discipline to create something yourself  you spend your time pointing the finger to actually talented people for not creating exactly what youre too lazy to do
what did you think of lara croft and the guardian of light
especially the people of tsushima made them ambassadors of the island
from all the whining I think I want to play this.
solution to avoid journalist bs step 1. ignore the woke malding journaliststep 2. dont feel bad  bad journalists   journalism causes more problems than goodstep 3. youre done
japanese cowboy game  sunset riders  konamI 1991
cant remember the last time I reed any journalism about games as a whole. if I  am interested in a game  I wait until it comes out and a lot of people reviewed it.  those people are mainly youtubers like angry joe  gameranx and such. never have I ever listed or respected the review from ign or any company like that. then from that make the decision of buying it. I dont even know who from the demographic that games all the time read any journalism  even more game journalism.
tomb raider talk starts at 11 30
the only real thing that pisses me off about ghostwire  tokyo is that I cant get it until a year later. I just got a series x  and its currently only available on ps5. and thatsucks  because this game bleeds everything I love  mythology  magic  weapons  fps gameplay. psychological elements  its basically my second perfect game from this year next to elden ring just from the description alone. seriously  8ft tall pale ghost woman with huge shears  monster with a monstrous maw hidden under tendril-like hair  a main villain with a noh mask of an onI  gah Im jealous!
you should join nick rekieta and read the unbreaded verse of the day.
there is japanese animes and games about cowboys and they are pieces of art.
some people are just looking for dragons to slay where there are none
so basically they can only compliment ghostwire by tearing down other games
it would be funner if you could play a demo real game during video.
greetings  melonie. the woke mob may come for you  but take heed  for it is written     blessed are you when they revile and persecute you  and say all kinds of evil against you falsely for my sake. rejoice and be exceedingly glad  for great is your reward in heaven  for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you.    the fact they call you mean names is a sign you ve done something right  so take it with a grain of salt. for  after all   you are the salt of the earth.    - rodel  _
jackie chan is from china  not japan  article writer.
toriI gates aren t just placed randomly  they are often placed in front of shinto shrines  lmao never been to or even looked at japan at all huh journo
why dont we ask the japanese about how they feel  they have the  internet  too I bet if they were angry they would tweet about it
I love elden rings design and I also am enjoying this game very much
didnt the devs of ghost of tsushima get honored as ambassadors of the island
I dare woke journalist play arma 3
ghost of tsushima is an amazing game. just shows you how people will hate on stuff for attention.
from soft should make a lara croft title.
damn dude I feel for you  I hope you are able to get your hands on it asap. love it when people find games that tick all their boxes  exclusives suck when you dont have the  right  platform.
it is on pc also.
@mad thing media  no gaming pc  and no money to get one.
yes they did but according to game journos apparently even that doesnt matter who cares what they think about anything
@keyblademaster-dan  I looked them up but aren t they owned by sony who is a japaneese company
I guess this fool missed the part where sp became the first western studio to win goty from famitsu for got.
legend too easy huh so can we expect a no cheats  no hints  no restarts run of tr3 on the ps1 soon
melonie would you rather play tomb raider legend or anniversary and underworld over the reboot triology I would
what program do you use for the verse of the day
love your show check out jayne theory and nina infinity.  triple threat stream.
its gotten to the point where I had just heard of ghostwire tokyo and was about to play it  but just seeing these journos talk positively about it makes me second guess and worry its injected full of woke nonsense.  I ll still play it  but its shocking how accurate the  if journos hate it  its great  if journos love it  its trash  method has been for me so far.  they re like negative marketing at this point.
game journalism is honestly the most useless industry around  pretty much no gamers read them and they are more focused on politics and forcing it into games rather than the actual games and the stories gameplay that they offer.
so game journalism is basically  take popular game everyone like  find reason to be offended...profit
you want to play a asian western type game try playing  samuraI western  its a very good underrated game.
journos still mad because ghost of tsushima wonthe players award over the last of us
so should we be mad at from software for being japanese and using european lore and style for the souls series   or should we just let anyone make any game the want
when journos are salty about a game or movie  it usually means its good seriously. these  journos  should learn what the word fictional means.
ofcourse they are mad about  representation  they are always mad.
sounds like this is a  fan boy girl type of person. jealous that ghost of tsushima was in my opinion on of the best japanese representative game. game was phenomenal.
and elden ring  dark souls  bloodborne  and demon souls were made by almost entirely japanese people  making inherently western style medieval gothic games. who cares. if the game is good who gives a damn who s behind it.
they re just mad ghost of tsushima had more love and culture to it than their trash woke games. the japanese are not against westerners partaking in their culture. when shown pics of western women in kimonos  japanese interviewees were pleased to see them. japan itself makes their own media based on european folklore  western characters  and places in the west. I have no objection to sharing culture. its what makes this country great.
freaking game journos again. can we just praise something without simultaneously bringing something else down in order to do it  according to this article s logic  from soft should be hated on for their medieval fantasy based games. Im surprised the author didn t bring the nioh franchise into this as being a better darksouls because it was a more culturally authentic soulslike than darksouls. personally I just like nioh more because of the gameplay combat setting. I really want to give ghostwire a try but I cant get my hands on a non-scalped ps5.
so first started with ghost of tsushima  and then sifu and now this
most game journalists aren t developers. I find it highly offensive that they have appropriated the industry without having the correct qualifications.  s
melonie gratz on breakin 30k sub
I gives a damn bigot!
I have literally no interest in sifu. I have some interest in ghosts of tsushima because itseems that even the japanese like it. so even if it is made by a western studio Imight enjoy it but it is sad how so many western studios have gone from making great game only a decade ago to rubbish journalists saying what they can and cannot make now.
what a tonedeaf article... ghost of tsushima got actally lauded by the kurusawa estate to use and call that mode kurusawa modeand suckerpunch became actual embassadors to the island of tsushima. saying they were thankfull for bringing the island in to the spotlight.
I wonder if there s some benefit for these journos in their getting a bunch of negative attention
these are the same journos that cried when people stopped talking about horizon forbidden west when elden ring came out. they are deeply bitter self entitled individuals that is sensing their doom approaching.I ll be picking up ghostwire in a few months when I am done with elden ring.
game journos are never happy and are hypocrites.
congrats on 30k
what about resident evil being created by the japanese  guess that doesnt count
these guys have to much time on their hands!
these people are insane.
not enough marines made the halo franchise!not enough albinos made the witcher games!not enough highschoolers made the persona games!not enough  greeks made assasins creed odyssey!not enough amputees made devil may cry!do these sound stupid  good. because it is.
game journos are just butt mad that people really dont care about them and there are many who left the reservation and they are still trying to join a party that is already dying
melonie you should try out insurgency sandstorm it is a great tactical military shooter yeahyeyeyeye
lashing on sifu creators over not having chinese at release is pretty stupid...its a small indie studio thatself-published it  not a aaa studio with publisher backing.I guess those jurnos dont understand costs of recording of voice overs...
Imean dark souls is essentially european fantasy from a japanese dev soooo
awww shit here we go again
its never enuf with these people they wil eat everyone and then there own.
fnt go boom
no one cares who makes a game. it doesnt matter what gender or race a programmer is as long as the product is good. thats the good thing about making games etc  its doesnt matter what u r. its not like a movie etc where they matter more
soon be 50k subs baby!
did anyone complain when afro samuraI came out     crickets
someone s going to cancel halo because the guardians in the game are depicted as marines  while the term guardian is used for giant robots instead.
I do find the lack of anthropomorphic talking hedgehogs involved in making the sonic series somewhat problematic. and I also hear that not a single member of the dmc dev team has been impaled by their own sword. thats one of those things youreally have to experience if youre going to write about it. and bayonetta  created by a bald guy. no wonder he thinks hair canturn into clothes and summon demons. no real life hair experience. I bet pac-man s creator doesnt even know what a ghost tastes like. have they no shame
not enough actual aliens were involved in games about aliens.
they are never happy
have you played samuraI western melonie
I notice alannah pearce still follows you. a pleasant surprise
when are they not mad
I dont know if it was real  and I dont really care one way or the other. most of the people in hollywood are not worth my time or money.
are these games journos ever feckin concerned about rather a game s good or bad from  like a well ya know gameplay prospective.
does this  journalist  even realize japanese studios do western-inspired games all the time. and they generally add their own vision to it  to say the least   instead of trying to be always  authentic .
games journalists get too high on their high horse.  that doesnt work.live and learn.
welcome to  Im cute  the channel
boomer here! yes Im old.
people need tbstart ignoring these woke cry bullies and telling them to get lost.
good for you
but when a japanese studio like capcom creates a western horror game like resident evil then there s no problem  Imean I dont have a problem with that what I do have a problem is with the double standards of this ppl
commenting to feed the algorithm.
thats what these wannabes are  fake fans   fake gamers
Im more pissed that this is a ps5 exclusive and not ps4 when ps5 are still scarce to buy you cant just walk into a local store and ask for a ps5 without employees giving you a funny look
im a boomster!
garbage writers  I think the only people who read those things now are streamers lol
hey melonie can I just say that game journos is not happy with the video games that is about to be coming out or is already out in stores and has different types of products like graphic design and pictures and how characters are showing like to be a real human in the video games. anyway I just want to tell you that how journos needs to stop being not happy with the video games and they need to just be pleased with how the video games are like and how they are being done and played to keep the kids and adult kids be happy to play this video game  ok melonie. anyway I do hope you understand what I am trying to say for this topic  ok. anyway hope you have a wonderful and great blessed day today at home with your pets.
cool
good luck.
real games journalism died when a bunch of npr rejects got hired on to report on things that they dont actually care about.
urinalists again...
glad we have all those black game developers from compton to make a new gta game.... o wait
representation  souls series - japanese devs  mostly european looking architecture  armor  weaponry... ghost of tsushima - western devs  japanese setting and history  recommended by the city of tsushima    journos are stupid.
woke lunatics will lunatic.
to bad jacky chan is chinese. this article ooooooo. I also want to point how how they did not point out the yakuza games. I bet this writer has never played one of those games. you literally play in japanese locations.
day 22 of commenting on your videos until g-fuel sponsors me.so its so funny that they shit on ghost of tsushima when like japanese devs praised it like crazy... yet these ppl dont praise cod vanguard even though its literal garbage because it bent itself backwards in order to appease wokies to the point where its uninspired garbage.
wait....  old boy  is chinese   hong kong cinema  who is the racist here  yep. that article author.
comment for the algorithm
well if they played the game but they said they did they would know this game is bland and shallow and has barely any substance to it its story is boring and and having to protectionist kind of ruins the game because you dont get to find out much about his sister and youre too busy worrying about the other protagonist that is in your body giving you superpowers and his story so the journalist is incorrect and destroys any argument they even had this game is not even survival horror and evil within is much better game
before I watch the video I have to say it does not feel right you wearing a jumper.....
I saw this article on my timeline read it for a little bit and couldn t finish it. this asian americantry so hard to virtue signal just for edge point gtfo! most of the comments were deleted on the page   go check it out!
this just seems like a desperate grift by some insanely racists people to get their foot in the door with companies solely based on their race and not much else. how bout this instead. can you program games competently and skillfully to a degree as to compete with some of the most talented developers the world over  if not programing expertise  then do you have any talent in graphical design or character and asset modeling with at least 5 10 years experience in the industry   if not that do you have any talent as a sound designer or in musical creation   if you have none of these things  or at the very least have bare bones  fischer price baby s first experience level in game design  then Im sorry you need to be satisfied with getting in on the ground floor with a much lower profile game developer and through hard work and talent work your way up to a company like tango gameworks  or sucker punch productions. you dont get to just boss your way into any company you want to  crying reeeeeeeeecisim! at the top of your lungs just because the people making the game aren t the  right  skin color  race  or ethnicity to you. that  is true racism!better yet how bout this  go make your own game about asian culture and compete with these companies you loathe so much. try pulling away their audience with the promise of  authentication  you so desperately champion...fyI the island of tsushima and the ministry of travel in japan made sucker punch studios honorary ambassadors of the island for their amazing job in depicting the locals  culture  traditions and people of the island! thats how badly they nailed the representation in that game! grift harder games journos!
the only thing that was cool in this whole game was combat the rest of the game was boring
