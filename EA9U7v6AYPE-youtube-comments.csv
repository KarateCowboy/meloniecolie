Im patiently waiting for the 2023 remake of ben-hur  been-her.
emilia clarke actually did refuse to get naked after a few seasons on got. people cheered for her strong decision. julian blaylock argued with the writers on star trek enterprise a lot. she was a huge fan of trek  and fought with them any time they broke canon. fans  myself included  loved her for it. so to see them freak out over henry do those same things is so incredibly hypocritical. henry deserves better.
liam hemsworth should play a witcher by a different name and school.
respectable young lady! keeping it real  keeping it nerdy.
I hear liam hemsworth was originally casted as geralt and that he is a fan. Im not sure how true that is. but I dont think it matters at this point. henry has brought geralt to life so perfectly that no matter what liam does itstill wouldn t be enough. I honestly feel sorry for liam. he s being set up for failure and its not fair to him.
the look on melonie s face in the thumb
liam could play a different witcher just not gerald and it kind of makes you wonder regardless of henry if he s willing to step into the role of gerald as they re willingly destroying it I could understand liam s desire to play gerald but just not like this not under these circumstances and conditions
I want mr. hemsworth to continue the cavalier trolling mr. cavill started by reading the books and playing a game in the series. that would be pretty funny. and also  well done on staying hydrated! stay awesome  melonie!
you do some of the funniest faces for your thumbnails melonie I swear to God
will u be reviewing more blood origins and witcher stuff  your narration and voice over was pure gold. possibly the only redeeming feature.
Ive watched quite a few of your videos and I have to say that although Imight not agree with everything you say  I have a lot of respect for you. I agree with your decision to be independent and speak your mind  instead of selling yourself out just to make big companies happy. I also love how youre respectful and light-hearted toward others who may oppose your beliefs. we need more people like you in this world  especially in leadership positions. youre awesome  melonie mac. keep it up.
belated congrats on 100k subscribers  melonie! great job with everything. keep it up!
guys... she stops to drink water. houston  we have a take-off. I repeat  we have a take-off.plays highway to the danger zone
the highlight of liam s career  the knife kick from jvd in expendable 2.
let s not forget liam is not at fault for any of this. he s just trying to get paid. give him some support and encourage him to learn what the role really means. unless he opens his mouth and says some dumb shit  its the writers and management all at fault. blame them.
also  we are all proud of your staying hydrated darlin. God bless
massive respect to you for staying true to yourself  mel and not being a puppett. meat
12 50 they literally did everything they could to not be close to the source material. that is a major reason why cavill left. they hated cavill for defending the source material. the whole point of recasting him is to not have someone defending the source material. being close to the source material now is just an insult to everyone involved  both to cavill and the staff who fought him. it also says a lot about hemsworth and where his social and political views lie. he is constantly in movies which subvert the source material or focus mainly on woke talking points. even in the hunger games he was cucked by jennifer lawrence.
I remember when I was in high school. I used to bring my pok mon strategy guide to school and I was laughed at and called a  nerd  like it was an insult. however I always felt at home when I used to go to the chinese manga stores to buy dbz on vhs tapes.. anyway glad to see youre doing great!
hollywood is so dumb. yes hydrate!!! we love to see it. yeah we want people who care about the source material. people who care about the fans. and stop with this made for a mondern audience stuff  that just looks and sounds like crap. yeah the naughty scenes are awkard. and I didn t think are necessary. but maybe thats just me. great video melonie. youre doing great. take care.
rofl!!!
lmao
bruh  this comment made me die inside.
in scotland still pronounced ben hur.
absolutely hilarious.
as I do agree and it could be free to do its own thing we cant trust them look at blood origin.
that would make me happy if this was the route taken
good take I agree. maybe one a   dem cat school assassin type. given they seem like jerks anyway. heh.
why is it that audiences so often have better ideas than the people making the damn shows
@that guy with the face  people making the show probably dont even know there are other witchers.
@thedarkemissary  they d probably never encountered the books or games before  and thought they were signing up for another harry potter spinoff. henry cavill had to leave after they killed his horse off because they thought a broom was closer to the source material.
I agree. it would have been better than then rewriting it all after season 3. after watching blood origin  I see them now rewriting it all. could be wrong but ugh!
I have enjoyed the witcher a lot because I wasn t familiar with the game or books but love the genre and of course henry cavill. even so  it is my understanding that henry  strictly speaking  does not match the physical description of geralt in the books. liam may be better in that way. but if they dont adhere to canon that wont matter either. reminds me of tom cruise s portrayal of jack reacher. tom s acting very nearly made up for the almost full foot taller the character is supposed to be. casting 6 5  alan ritchson and sticking so closely to the books is what made  jack reacher  such a success for the amazon series. there s a lesson there thatseems obvious. do it right and it will be successful... and make them money. fans want no part in woke-washed  agenda driven stories. just stop. quality content. is it really that hard
agreed. but we all know this is a too smart idea for them. plus it doesnt fit their agenda
as if we need more characters invented by netflix
why  they destroyed the witcher  first they should hire better writers who like the witcher games and books.
no.
his name is garry of the platypus school.
agreed
his witcher is from hufflepuff.its canon  dummy !
geralt
thats gonna be demand no. 1 in his contract   in order to play out the vision of the production and create a quality product this character will take a different route from the  novels and games   therefore no mention  dialogue nor reference to any material outside the production will be allowed under any circumstances on the set
@k ant.  but the idea would be that hemsworth honors the material and tries to change the scenes like cavill did  and ends up getting booted too. would be extra hilarious  and even if he would maybe not get paid  he would get a truckton of attention by people  meaning he could really step up in the famous hierarchy to the near top
I would have picked anson mount as the witcher  he looks very close to the games   he was my first pick instead of henry cavill  but when I saw henry as the witcher  I was satisfied with it but  no no way liam hemsworth
@kamranahmed  sadly  no actor could make this show better. henry cavill tried...
@fino diez  yes  I want this to be a running gag with all the actors who play geralt. they get hired  they refuse to stray from the source material  get fired  and the role is then passed to someone else  and then someone makes a legendary shitpost on the wikI in the style of a ballad by dandelion  called  the mantle of geralt the based  or something.
my face is built for making funny faces lol!
haha I will try to get episode 2 up this week  Ive been dreading watching another episode but it is too fun to do those voiceovers  so I will make it happen  p
thank you so much!
bahahaha!!!
lol nice one
@b n  nicer than liam s choice in women
exactly. man s gotta eat
while I agree the blame lies with the studio but then why would we continue to support the show
shame too cuz he s not terrible. he s not great either but I feel like he s still too good for a lot of the movies in which he s been
wow. haven t heard  cuck  used for a good while. coooooooool.
gamers are so oppressed indeed.and people say we gen zers live in the worst time at least nerds are trendy rather than bullied.but then incels say otherwise whatever the hell they believe in
@chandler burse  well the nerds that get bullied are by definition then incels lol the problem isn t nerdy stuff  and the public and participating in it  is the type of people that would participate in it. people who would just wear gym clothes they were dirty  and not groom or bathed well  and were very overweight were the ones who were playing pok mon or yu-gi-oh. like people shouldn t be bullied  but how are those nerdy  kids weren t very nice actually  and they were kind of mean to other people. when I went to high school  most people that were bullies were the weirdos and the losers. they were the ones that were jerks other people. and I said out of someone who loves nerdy stuff and collected yu-gi-oh in elementary school and middle school and I still collected it when I was 29 and I just turned 30. but obviously some people are picked on and its not fair but again  a lot of people that were picked on by everyone  they were kind of the jerks first  and I didn t really have anything going for them witches maybe why they were mean to people to make up for that
plus Im glad they listened to the somic fans and gave us a good fun sonic movie s
I think he has potential if he stays true to the story. Ive seen these situations go both ways. the more of the woke nonsense they keep out of it  the better the show will be. I  like many others  have seen too many shows lately where they inject things in that have absolutely no relevance to the story. melonie is totally right about the haters wanting to hijack a brand and change it to their own narrative.
after seeing clipped coins and your review of blood origins  that is the witcher they really wanted to make. they just want the witcher skinsuitso they can blame the fans when they fail with all the typical ists and isms.
gotta gatekeep the writers of most of these shows lately right the heck outa there. and that bit about not watching got with your family reminded me about your story of watching the northman with your dad.
they put game of thrones on sunday nights so you can  watch it with your family.  haha   yeah right after church melonie. I totally agree wit you about the awkwardness with thatshow especially the incest part.
liam hemsworth could portray eskel or lambert on the witcher
the thing with hollywood is that even if you know every nook and cranny of the source material and look like the character they will still hire a big name actor over you 9 10. also the director of the tomb raider netflix anime said that we will see what lara croft is gonna look like in the series soon which I do not have high hopes for given the base synopsis of the series but who knows maybe I ll be surprised by how she looks cuz the animation is gonna be done by the same people who did the castlevania series and they kept the characters in thatseries as close looking to their game counterparts as they could.
would not be surprised if they wanted liam as someone who lacked the clout or likelihood to push back on or stand up to the writers. cavill was able to do that because he s a-list  not just because he s a fan.
I think the look  is would be if he looks like this  but without good writing all is lost. sad for liam I fear he s gonna take the hit for other people s crappy writing.
let s be honest- their litmus test was  will you play ball
Im not going to judge a profromace from any actor till I see them act. but what really matters is the writing got to have good amounts of fan service to please everyone.
I have seen several replacement actors that did fine. I will give it a chance and form my opinion after.
the sonic peeps finally listened at the 11th hour !!! which absolutely saved that franchise!! sonic 1.0   both in the teasers   in chip  n dale  rescue rangers  still haunts my dreams
with all of these books or video games being turned into movies tv shows or having them redone it makes me think about one of my favorite books having this happen.  while it happened back in 2006 itstill frustrates me. I speak of eragon. while the movie might have been considered ok if not good by some people who say it. it cut and changed so many things that were in the book that it is one movie I wish I had never seen let alone bought without seeing beforehand. those who have seen the movie and read the book know what I am talking about. would I like to see a remake to the movie to try and fix the mess the original made  if Christopher paolinI didn t have a major hand in the production of the movie  I would rather just tell the entire production team to stop and dont bother. if people want to turn games or books into movies or tv shows  they need to stay as close to the source material as possible.
looks better than I thought it would.
priceless facial expression in the thumbnail!
it doesnt matter how good hemsworth could do in the role  he s not going to be given material befitting that role.
I absolutely love liam hemsworth  poor guy xd
cant wait to see how this plays out with the new liam hemsworth geralt
mel   I remember thinking dont be mean. I remember thinking there was room for everybody. I too remember the before times when we could assume that an incomer was just an excited newbie and not an opportunistic cuckoo.
she bought the lara croft
lambert. he could have been a good lambert.
its too late now!  they already murdered eskel!
well its too late for that unfortunately.
duh but you can still say a 3 foot tall 400 lbs black man is a bad case to play the witcher. you can still say its a bad cast before you see it lol

dont worry  if you watch the God-awful blood origin its very easy... they are using the multiverse... different face but is still the same as geralt.
not getting a single viewing minute from me
I remember the times when people actually respected eachother and werent assuming or judgmental.oh wait that never really existed despite popular belief.
the writers have already proven their commitment to not letting it work
he looks good but the plot changes theyre doing to the overall arc due to blood origins changes are worrisome. its gonna go super woke
at this point  I ll settle for creatives that dont hate the property.
I ll be surprised if this goes well!
they dont want fans in the writers room because they hate the fans.
its so disheartening when the love of something brinks enough willingness to see the product on the bug screen and nonfans destroy and    redo  the product to soot their narrative s  instead of what made ppl love it in the 1st place.
facial hair doesnt look like a normal beard but some of the old traditional mustaches and kind of goatee.    the moustache part is traditional but the beard  I dont remember when researching the polish half or 1 3 of the family.  and Im roughly halfway into the first book not exactly what I expected but still good.sort of reminds me of the book  who fears the devil.
liam hemsworth in the lead role   I thought that was reserved for yennifer
henry kept the witcher project on the rails  without him the shows dead.
well I guess the viewers who watch are gonna have to give it time to see if he s right for the part.
tbh  I d be an actor in the shadow of a thousand superior actors and actresses if I still get a couple mill a year.
most actors say they are fans of whatever you pay them to be.
I think he will be okay  he is a good actor.
not gonna lie. he does not look as bad as I expected him to look
baby thor cant save you netflix
nothing against liam  I wish him luck. haven t heard his voice for geralt  but I imagine if he had the role before henry it would have been accepted assuming his voice works well. problem is the director and writers...the show is just bad  with or without henry.
so that piece about henry cavill being difficult to work with ended up being completely false and the original poster issued an apology about it.  its pretty clear henry s team threatened legal action and the original poster then back tracked on it all  said they should have verified their source etc.
hey melonie! go to see you. looking forward to tnme. its going to be great.
the problem is they hijack the storylines and then dont even play the games or watch the movies that they hijacked so it just makes no sense.
I was like  ain t that thor !
thats all we ever wanted even as far back as uwe boll s work

I thought geralt didnt have facial hair in the books  he looks like he did in the first game.albeit in the first game hes way uglier than he s ever been
appreciate your support towards my channel 
rofl!!!!
when in the time when the main actor or actress was replaced I cant imagine jon snow as somebody else  that character belongs to kit like geralt belong to henry...
glad to see you drinking  so maybe I wont comment about water  water  water on every video. hahaha congratulations on over 100 000 subscribers. keep up the good work. youre videos are entertaining.
he s in a tough spot. cant blame him for wanting the check.
seems he has the right look based on the art but I will retain low expectations until they can prove the season 4 is a good season and liam does indeed have the right look.
there s only one geralt when it comes to film and thats henry.
they photoshopped lats on him because he s not that big.  he s not little  and while he s in good shape  he s not a bulky-type of muscular.
you cant replace him at all. its too late because he has been seen as geralt since 2019
lead role
with all this witcher drama going on  Im glad that the proposed elric of melnibon  series never got green lit. the reason why it got canned  people would think its a ripoff of the witcher.edit  all right! look at you hydrating  butter babe. keep it up lol
liam hemsworth  could work if the writing is good. he played quI gon jin.
what if it was chris hemsworth   he already pretty much looks like a witcher. Imean  he looks more like geralt than henry does if we re going to be honest about it.
it is a sad state to say the least  should just end it on season 3.
henry cavill !!! have to wait and see what happens
there s room for everybody...  rip 2022
11 00  ever since game of thrones.... I have the exact opposite experience  since the woke wave hit  everyone seems to go out of their way to avoid nudity  this is for western productions . hell  even the mediocre new game of thrones does that. maybe the shows we watch are just radically different
@11 15  it was  the spartacus blood and sand series   created that genre  of over the top  random medevil accent nudity in a show.  game of thrones just kept the style going
liam just needs to stand out and go for unexpected rolls  follow the path of clint howard and be his own thing.
as my homie from hey arnold said he s a phoney!!!!
nothing better than listening to a based q t
hey melonie. great to see a new video. you are stunning today how is there no steelers stickers on that bottle yet!
melonie  you did click bait! how dare you! lol. always enjoy your videos. do miss your scripture studies.
everything Ive seen is just liam s face on caville s face. to the point where its obviously henry s jawline.
al pacino as geralt.
liam playing geralt is not what worries me. its the arrogant writers that will  already have  butcher this show.
liam has very big shoes to fill and everything against him.  if he can pull it off it will be great for his career  but more likely he will be the victim of circumstances  studio behavior and bad decisions.  he shouldn t have taken the role.
I feel sorry for hemsworth. he s trying to fill huge shoes  but beyond that  he s taking on the horrendous results of netflix s idiocy.
at least this will free up cavill for his warhammer project  assuming amazon prime doesnt  wheel of time  it.
yeah  2022 has chalked up to be the worst year for films and tv shows I hope hollywood and the other clowns at amazon wake up when the money starts to dry up. I genuinely want to know who the fk is responsible for hiring these writers because itseems since like 2012 the quality of everything has been going backwards with the exception of a few gems that make it through the mess.
regardless of the acting chops of discount hemsworth  and whether or not they return to a more accurate adaptation in the coming witcher seasons  I will not watch it. henry cavill was the only reason I stuck through season 2  even though I didn t really like the first one. I cannot and will not support netflix anymore with my money and time. though saying that  I will probably end up ing season 3 eventually  if the usual youtube suspects end up saying its okay.
would be funny is after the 4  season is release someone uses deepfake to put kavil face in the show and the deep fake version is get more praise than the oficial version of the show
a small detail  geralt wouldn t grow a beard  he actually hates it. it was a game only thing that became too big.
im willing to give him a chance  I think the issue is more about the writers to be honest.
henry is geralt.
maybe he ll be a geralt made younger. liam is studying up as chris has been advising him since the role was announced. but if the writers suck then so will the show.
no it wouldn t. the real reason why cavill left was because the writers of the show want to add stuff in the show thats not part of the source material. like unnecessary sex scenes that dont make sense stuff like that. so it dont matter who s in it it matters who s writing it
remember when we all raged against heath ledger being cast as the joker  give liam a chance.
I honestly cant even see season 4 happening. if they have any sense left at all it will get canned. the reaction to henry leaving  the reception of blood origins and the general state of their shares  I just dont see it. its money down the drain. one day they will just have to accept that they give the fans what they want  or they fail.
at first  I thought it was liam nessans- and I was like   okay  maybe. ....now Ive been corrected  and I dont think this will work.
liam hemsworth actually looks more like geralt from the game in my opinion. henry cavil is great as geralt. the problem with the series is purely the writing and directing. even if liam blows the performance out of the water and does as good of a job as henry did... the show will still be terrible.
was about to say  there is no way he is that big. not his body type
he can understudy all day but no matter the show is doomed. our conan the barbarian was replaced too soon.
henry already looked super young as geralt.compared to the games especially.
no fuck that. liam lives in chris s shadow
I love the guy and I ll give him a chance. he should consult cavill like ben affleck did bale though before jumping on the horse.
even if liam looks the part  does it well in season 4  etc. I doubt he s going to be viewed by the fans as anything other than the  scab  that came in after cavill went on strike. I know thats not really fair to him  but at this point he s a knowing collaborator in all of this woke nonsense  so...
you look like some magical dungeons and dragons creature...
the direction the show is going in is that liam will be the 4th most important female star of the show.the 3 females will be the main stars. gerault will become a co star...
well call me crazy  I dont wanna watch....y should we think that they now will make the witcher the right way  I have no faith in what they make anymore......I ll just stick to watching awesome ppl like u.....much more entertaining
I never understood ever how people could just be replaced from movies and series and we are just supposeed to just further suspend our disbelief as we watch these new actors take their place in the next season or in the sequel.the only movie series thatsurprised me with a somewhat more sensible approach was the transformers movies. I know they aren t really that good. but when shia labeouf and megan fox were replaced  then new actors didn t just take over their roles  but instead were given new characters to play as.I know that this wouldn t quiet work with the witcher series. but that is when you usually either try to make a compromise with someone like henry to keep him on  or you cancel the whole show.
I think liam would be just fine playing giralt but the real problem will come from the showrunners.
no way - thats not geralt.
disappointed that henry wont be in witcher because there are not many medieval fantasy shows to watch. cop shows are more common. I  m not sure what it will be like if they replace a main character.
agree with the awkward thing   time and place for everything and makes the drama less mature when you try to appeal to hormonal teenagers and wine moms who are not getting any at home.
this will be interesting.....cbr article - report  netflix s the witcher seasons 4 and 5 begin developmentfansided article - the witcher season 4 and season 5 rumored to be in the works already at netflix
I feel sorry for liam  because first he was rejected for thor for being too young looking  or so I heard anyway. now he s being expected to take up after henry cavill in this role ! I wish him all the luck  he s going to need it. speaking as an og nerd who was nerdy long  long  as in decades  before it was trendy  gate keeping needs to make a comeback to weed out the posers and the fakes. the way its going lately  we need to have that happen  sez me. let the woke folks cry about it all they want to  they dont care about us  so why should I care what they have to say  Im with you  excessive sexual content and attempts at being  edgy  are more awkward than anything else  and studios are trying too hard to emulate  got   I concur. I dont associate that kinda thing with  high fantasy  or what have you. I prefer that to stay at least a bit wholesome  you know
marvel phase 5  is here ! time for kang the conqueror. the witcher is alright mac go boom.
problem if henry knows the shows story and its bad enough he left what does that tell you!
I cant think of a single thing discount hemsworth has been in
canthis work    the reason it may or may not work is not down to the actor  its down to the writing team. its irrelevant really who is geralt  if the source material continues to be mocked and ignored.
I get the impression that liam hemsworth will be a meat puppet  just happy to have a job  and wont defend the fans or the source material one bit.
regardless of wether he does a good job is irrelevant because we already know the team behind the show hates the source material  no
with all respect to hemsworth  its my personal opinion that he s too young in appearance alone. it will be very hard for him to convey the road-weary  battle-hardened warrior veteran that geralt is.
I agree  nudity for nudities sake is awkward. its gotta serve a purpose to the story.
um  you never saw the hunger games  pretty huge movies
@static charm  that was him  I fell asleep watching it. original battle royale was more intriguing
@static charm  I just recently rewatched the hunfger games with my daughters. dont know what part was his. dont know any movie this guy has been in.
the only thing that comes to mind is that teeny bopper disney channel original he did with miley cyrus a long time ago  and I didn t even watch it lol!
he was in one of the expendables movies  I think
@joseph crabtree  saw all of them and dont remember him. doesnt bode well for the witcher
yup truth
mads mikkelsen should have been the next witcher. liam looks so soft
liam s not a bad actor  and in that photoshop pic he looks better as a witcher than I thought he would. however...1  cavill nailed the role  and I cant think of anyone who could fill those shoes. but for example  luke evans would ve been a closer fit than liam imo.2  the voice. for anyone who s played the games  geralt has a very distinct voice  which henry did a great job of emulating. I could be wrong  but hard to imagine liam having a voice thatsounds right for the role.3  the story will still be terrible. after 2022 Im convinced that only people who love  original  fantasy in the first place can actually get these kinds of movies shows right. so unfortunately liam will be doing his best on the titanic...which has already hit the iceberg.
even yellow eyes wouldn t sell it imo
I ll be honest henry had no nudity meanwhile the girls did.geralt would be nude in the games and it was kinda lame he wouldn t show any butt.ya I said
bro couldnt even get katniss.
4 09 what some people came for   these days  I feel like mugen developers get lara croft better than official stuff last 5 years and thats sad. gatekeeping is needed   metal fans anime fans software developers gasp in unison . Im not a witcher gamer but the games are really fleshed out and depp  I hope liam is able to pull a heath ledger and really surprise people
if liam hemsworth was any sort of man he would have said no that roll was taken and you cant replace it.
awe poor  l  I am
after them complaining about henry I doubt they will get another fanbut as someone who doesnt like sex in shows when its not needed I wanted it in this show cus it makes more sense to the version most of us know from the gamesand I think henry was ok with it in sesson 1 cus he wants it to be accurate but I think after season 1 that was the one thing he was ok with changing cus in interviews woman were always asking him about it and they were super unprofessionalyou wouldn t see a guy trying to talk to a actress about her nude sceans whilst making thirsty comments without people calling him a creep for making the actress feel awkward I think henry just got fed up with being treated like a piece of meat by interviewers and the women at work
can you imagine peter jackson getting rid of Christopher lee  when he  lee  gave directions on the lotr lore  the person who knew the most out of any1 on the set about the source material of thatseries of films  Imean fuck knowing the material inside and out beforehand. the writers who  I bet  probably thought the lead roles  name was jerald  or probably yennifer  dont need input  they know stuff. itshows in their writing...
honestly  if we just set aside the fact that they are replacing cavill and all that that entails  I dont think hemsworth looks  bad  as geralt but what s with the beard  just try to make him look like the same character as much as you can  at least. if they re going for a time skip then they need to grey his beard too. its a small but very noticeable shift in character design for me  enough to be off-putting.also  yeah I was one of those people who sneered a little when cavill was announced and I was happy to eat my words when the thing came to light. even in season 1  which was the better of the two overall  I still think cavills geralt was the highlight for me. its reminiscent  for me at least  of when they announced ledger as the joker. everyone laughed until they saw his performance.
they really do need to reboot it  its less insulting than this. but its screwed either way
what s wrong with liam hemsworth he s quite a decent actor
happy new year. Gods blessings upon you.
sadly  it doesnt matter much. the writing was already causing my interest to wane. they seem to view the books as simply suggestions
I actually think liam looks pretty good there. doesnt matter - the writers and showrunner are still the same  so its doomed to fail.
he could pull off the witcher if he was in a proper adaptation of the series.
they should pick matt bomer for geralt. wouldn t even notice... kinda. just needs to bulk up a bit.
at least he has longer arms than cavil.
14 12 take that  blacklist  status as a badge of honor. living for the world s standards will leave you empty. living for God is the best option in life  and Im glad thats the road you ve chosen to take.
how many franchises can he save
mads looks more like geralt from the first game than either liam or henry does
amen! thank you! itsure was fun getting to travel and host for these companies  but even so I am much happier doing what I do now and not feeling like I have to filter myself. I never felt like when hosting I could ever be authentically me  it was almost like acting. I had over a decade of fun doing all that  but now I can just be me and I love that even more!
as a Christian with doubts its terrible hard to see life worth living that way since I dont feel like I do.Bible says forsake the world well we arent doing that  still on the internet and materialistic. playing and watching games and movies some give good arguments for we are meant to spread into the world not abandon it but I havent done anything.and nowadays I fear that if my belief is wrong my life will only be more depressively wasted and false hope of seeing beloved late relatives again.even more ironic discussing the witcher recently got into the 3rd game and geralt is an atheist in a supernatural world
@melonie mac go boom  well all I can say is  and Im sure there are those who would agree with me... a lot of us are grateful that youre free to speak your mind like you do and yourefuse to be a puppet. you carry a message thatso many need to hear! or  in my case as a believer  messages and videos that are really edifying to listen to!yeah  you get the occasional condescending troll... but I think youre accomplishing so much good with your platforms- especially when you talk about God and the gospel. and you do it in a way thats not muddied with a bunch of foul language.

good luck to them. Ive already committed to never watching season 4.
remember  it doesnt matter if hemsworth is a fan of the source material  he will be bowled over more easily than cavil.it doesnt matter if he s a great actor  a great actor will just do a great job bringing to life the work of the writers  producers   directors.a lore-loving show runner is the only hope for this show in my opinion   we re not getting that.
shows will  more often than not  fade into obscurity when a or the main character is replaced.
mel  youre missing the point. the people who wanted games to be more inclusive didn t even want a walking simulator. they wanted to latch on to an industry that was making money. these are all the same people. none of them care about comics  film  television  video games  tabletop rpgs  or any of it. they just want to leech off of a  scene  thats now popular that can earn them money.
he could play as a witcher. but not as geralt. he s just another witcher probably named chris. chris the witcher from the school of honeybadger or something.
I want sonic the hedgehog to play geralt. they cant stop him.
three seasons as the leading man on the netflix series    one and maybe two thirds of a season total out of three  I feel like Im being generous  maybe 1-1 2 seasons as leading man.
ffs    why pay licensing if your just going to change the product   go boom
it doesnt matter who plays geralt as long as you have the same garbage writers and showrunner.  its going to suck.
school of the cat maybe I can see some options for him 1 24
Im a og fan. besides the fact that henry was the absolute fan favourite  recast suck! nothing against william  its just that there is always those few actors who must star in each and every production of certain budget in a certain role. I was struggling to keep watching witcher with henry onboard. now Im cosidering quitting netflix altogether. they ll never learn. its all just numbers to them.
I actually feel kinda bad for hemsworth. he is just taking a job  and in the process has walked into a huge mess that really has nothing to do with him. the show runners on the other hand  get no such sympathy. they deserve all the backlash they get.
Im sure Ive seen dollar tree hemsworth in somethingI just dont know in what
they had already ruined cavill s gerarlt. no way in hell that one comes close to the character.
nice one mel   they are ruining everything
I have zero skin in this game by not caring about the witcher.. but let s be honest here.. the reason they hired hemsworth is because he ll roll over  play nice and do as he s told and wont complain when they shove their hand up his a   to mouth whatever talking points they want to get out. this show is even more doomed. I at least respect cavill for being a fan and walking away from what was his dream because they had no interest in making  the witcher  just some weird sad pale imitation.
liam hemsworth work in the role  a lot of actors could work for the role  if the series had competent writers who revered the source materials so probably not.
liam hemsworth he looks all right as geralt although it would be probably good for him to shave and he ll look okay the different colored beard with the white hair done not look good
does it really matter if hes any good  if the writers are still terrible  cavill was as good as it gets and itstill sucked in many places
you give an inch  they take a mile.
ooh good point  very well said
he was in hunger games watching his girlfriend get engaged and fall in love with a guy named peta.
liam looks the part. too bad blood origins killed any hope of netflitcher being remotely decent.
lots of folks thought the twilight guy would be a terrible batman. I guess my point is we wont know until we see it.
it looks like they photoshopped his face on henry
they could cast danny devito as geralt for all I care. this shit is done...
anytime wokeness results in a cast change  no it wont work...
some say thatshow can be redeemed in the eyes of a fan  just like house of the dragon or stranger things season 4 prooved.I didn t see either  so cant realte - let just wait  but with those  showrunners  who destroyed season 2 of the witcher I doubt it can be salvaged at all...
there is unfortunately no way this will work because of the writers..they could make a witcher show with any somewhat buff dude. thats not really the issue. but if there passion and lore isn t there then nothing is
no  liam is not able to pulloff playing geralt.
I will not be watching liam as a pity watch. I know he needs a job. he s handsome  and he will have no problem staring in his own show as a supporting actor to yennefer. unfortunately since netflix produces projects that feel like activism  my activism will be that my home has already cancelled netflix. they are blocked from charging me since Christmas.
go hydration!  woot!
the show is already done. if they didn t respect the lore with henry involved  imagine what they gonna do now with liam. its gonna be on the same level with blood origin or worse.
even if liam nails the part  I think they ve strayed too far from the source material. Imean  s2e2 was already blasphemous and unforgivable.
wish him the best. wont watch lol
I dont think it ll matter to have liam take over.  geralt will still be hamstrung and minimized so it ll still be a crappy show because the people in charge haven t changed anything at all.  just so freaking lame.  and a certain shame that it is.
the writers hating the source material should already been a  red flag  not only for this show but for every show out there who loves to f up know ips. amazon with rop ffs.
admittedly he does look like the hexer geralt than henrys did but well hexer wasnt received well at least by americans.
Imean no disrespect to liam but I dont think anyone could save this franchise  at this point. Im more worried about how the crew will treat him...
apt analogy!
I swear  the casting department needs to be fired. they keep thinking geralt is pretty boy handsome  when actually he s really rough looking with all his scars but rugged handsome underneath them. the books states this many times. appreciate cavil s passion but he was really a bad geralt and Im surprise many fans ignore his bad acting skills. I think cavil will make a wonderful executive producer for witcher but not as the white wolf himself. no matter because netflix witcher was poop show inside and out.
he can pull it off.  too bad the writers wont.  with all the shadows  he should save on overpriced sunglasses.   although night vision ain t cheap either....      p
true!
those folks are obsessive and believed that pattinson couldnt be anything but edward they just hate him for no good reason. they just hated twilight as a trend and now that hes moved on from that period they cant stand it.hes a great actor but people who hate him refuse to admit it because they are still stuck in 2008 or whatever.and even pattinson hated those movies more than anyone else he regrets doing them now.
right  season 1 wasn t even close to good
geralt in the books says he s ugly himself
well  itshould be obvious by now that henry cavill was the reason thatseries got a fourth season at all. indeed  they will have to provide more fan service now  since henry cavil s shadow looms over them all and liam hemsworth stans untried as geralt of rivia. but then again  what kind of business sense there is that caters to a niche audience when the games were played by millions  far surpassing that niche audience s numbers  is this a run for guinness world record of wasting money in a series  rop takes the cake in that  no chance of topping that
I dont mind if hemsworth plays geralt  Im just not interested in the story line the witcher is taking. the next couple seasons of the witcher will be like blook origins. seasons 1 2 were ok to me  but I feel like they wouldn t have been even that if henry cavill wasn t there to keep them honest.
I have to say...thats a lot of melanin in his skin. considering geralt is an albino.
I thought henry was doing an amazing job of playing garelt. but season 1 was ok up s and downs but henry was great   season 2 was bad but henry was great. I was losing hope after season 2. cavill leaving is really bad for the show as in season 3 I had decided that if it was like season 2 I was done anyway. I have played all the games and had audio books. I think the writing sinks and some of the actors are wooden.
I dont really like the picture  but not being official I dont really mind. anyway the biggest problem is the writing  as always.
alexander skarsgard would ve been a great replacement for geralt.
I will never understand how people are uncomfortable around sexuality but dont have any problem with all the blood and gore in a series like this. that is so incredibly twisted in my eyes.
this show doesnt stand a chance until lauren hissrich is fired.
got a message for mel  hope she sees it  just heard her on g g.  very important.in 2019 I got cov and for me I just wasn t hungry  wasn t thirsty and felt like I had a flu and would get sick if I drank or ate.so I got severely dehydrated and went to er.  6 ivs later  good ivs  ones containing electrolytes and felt great  took an antiviral that I probably didn t need  it was all dehydration.here s the point to this  comment .water alone would have just killed me  washing away whatever electrolytes I had left  so I needed both  everyone does  cant have one without the other.  its common knowledge but good doctors will tell you  but so many people literally think they just needed more water  when at that point  regular water would have been deadly.  make sense  if not  look into it  but I know youre really smart.sorry it was long but if I just said  electrolytes  doubt it has the same impact.
love you
with cavill I went with it because he was passionate about the role  but geralt isn t supposed to look like a  prince charming . he s described as rugged  not pretty. someone like clint eastwood in his younger days would ve been perfect. hugh jackman right now even.
personally  I wish liam the best of luck but for me  the witcher died with season 2. I just dont care enough anymore
haven t seen anything he s been in since... quick check later... expendables 2  2012    even then I had to check because I couldn t remember a thing he s been in  so he s hardly going to be a draw to get me to watch the show.
I think liam will dislike my comment hard.it looks fine. it doesnt feel geralt. it feels thor.I think I will watch 1 or 2 episodes of s4. after that decide.I am sceptical. I like witcher 3  I started reading one of the books. liked it but I just cant relax to read a book anymore. yeah  I know audio-books but haven t looked into it that much yet.melonie  until next time. stay hydrated!
the dude should have just stayed out of the show... he should have seen henry leaving as a warning of a disaster coming
henry cavill was a good geralt.  still he is not anything like the witcher 2 or 3 geralt in the games.  liam hemsworth will be different to form the source material awell.  liam hemsworth is reported to be a fan of the witcher  just like henry cavill.
keep this in mind  melonie  and everyone else... geralt was never  gorgeous   nor was he meant to be. anyone whose actually read the books would know that. xd
I thru up a lil bit in my mouth fr the title I got the eck s
hopefully they cancel it before season 4 comes out.  there is no replacement for cavill!
it looks weird cus I cantell thats henry s body I know thatsexy son of a b     body anywhere loland I wanted henry to grow a beard like the game cus I think the character should look grizzled
thats the issue for decades. nudity is censored by both political sides especially conservative Christian parents.a movie has and can show a man butcher and mutilate a child but has a harder time selling boobs.
what
yeah this is what ive asked of fans of henrys and no one really answers.geralt in the books has described himself as ugly even.hes scarred up and super pale and gaunt by the first games standards  very bangable for women sure but hes not henry cavil handsome and I wonder if henry wanted to looks rougher but the creators wanted to sell his looks.
clint is rougher sure hugh is too handsome like henry
he s book geralt
how many chances are you willing to give netflix  this is not about liam. this is about sending a message to activists who hate us and they used us. they targeted fans of the games and the lore for this show and by the time they launched the show it was for neither audience. they used us to get employment and put us last. giving liam a chance means giving netflix a chance and they dont deserve it.
to me it doesnt matter if he does a decent job in the role. the show runner and writers have guaranteed I wont be watching it.
call him the switcher not the witcher
I dont think we necessarily need writers that are  fans  so long as the source material is being respected. how often have we gotten fan fiction that turned out to be just garbage because they re not real writers and dont really know how to write for a show  the science fiction genre is full of it. thats happened far too often  so much so thatstudios shy away from it because you narrow down the audience far too much  advertisers pull their money and the show doesnt profit  or in the case of streaming  its not a show they can use to market their service and the service pulls the funding. the studio has no reason to continue making the show much to the annoyance of the super fan. the problem here is the opposite in that they re straying too far away from the source material and the fans that made it popular in the first place are being pushed away. in the ideal scenario the happy medium is struck where you have writers who are willing and able to be creative and explore avenues that make the show approachable and enjoyable to people who dont know much if anything at all about the source material  but at the same time keeping the fans happy by building upon and staying within the already established lore setting. this is like walking on a tight rope  though. lean a little too far one way or the other and you fall off.
never watching netflix or any box checking group destroy the witcher
I just dont care  I tuned out after season 1  Im just enjoying the witcher 3 upgrade on ps5
if we cant have henry then liam is the next best thing. he actually looks more like geralt. if you had told me the games used him as a model I would have believed it. the only thing that worries me is how he will behave.1. will he let the writers push him around.2. will he start insulting the fans on twitter.
I got nothing against hemsworth. he s done nothing wrong. but c mon man
at least we had 3 seasons of decent witcher. wasn t great but not bad either. I expect season 4 to be terrible then canceled.
discount chris hemsworth  ehhhhhhhh...nah.
henry cavil as the witcher could barely make the show work  not that cavil was bad  the show itself is bad. even if cavil stays in the show  it will still be terrible.ps. remember cavil s test picture of geralt that got so much backlash and hate
please sign the petition to keep henry and replace the writers  especially replace the writers.
I am done with woke netflix destroying this ip  nothing against liam at all.
sex sells and where used cleverly and with purpose its fine  but if youre shoehorning it into everything because its edgy and appeals to a younger and less  discerning  audience its a problem. the witcher deals with sex tastefully  so should the show.
eyes too close together
the witcher died when cavill left  and it was already going in the wrong direction anyway. hemsworth might be a good geralt  but I doubt he can overcome a woke-infested  source material hating writing team.
doesnt matter who s in the lead role  if the production is woke garbage from the ground up.
Im still shocked our host is middle age....but I digress
this series was dead on arrival  no matter what actor plays the part while the script is infected with  diversity and inclusion .
doesnt matter who they get to play geralt if the screenwriting is garbage
30 s ain t middle aged unless something tragic happens xd
@melonie mac go boom  melonies not middle aged. she ll look like she s in her 30 s when she actually in her 60 s or 70 s
@melonie mac go boom  true...guess 30 s is the new 20 s
if she is middle-aged  Im ancient.
50 is middle well sometimes 40 maybe because of counting to 80 where most people usually well die
@the real stephentv actually she does look 30 I think how she looks is how most well healthy 30 year olds usually look.people here seem to have the grasp that once a woman hits 30 she goes super downhill.explains the dead space video
@chandler burse  thats just the barney stinson effect.
@david franz  who the hell is barney stinson
@chandler burse  you ve never watched  how Imet your mother
your recent grifter Christian arc is pretty fascinating to watch. youre not very charismatic but I guess as long as you spout Bible verses you ll always have an audience.
if you see this message what kind of mic and camera you use
he looks like thor
my reaction   eew
they can cast any actor to play geralt but if the writers hate the source material and keep putting out this God awful show it wont make a difference. personally  and dont get me wrong I like him and this could be a writing issue  but henry cavill as geralt wasn t exactly that impressive. I know he loves the source material and he s a super nice cool guy but you barely see him in the show and when you do he mostly grunts and says  f ck  every now and then. what this could of been with henry and a team of passionate creators behind it
liam is too much of a pretty boy... not gritty enough to be geralt.
well it doesnt matter because after season 3 am out
commenting to feed the algorithm
I feel sorry for this dude...
modern writers writing something actually good  in other words  its going to crash and burn.
I hate to say this cause when I saw the hunger games I liked gale way more then peeta but Im sorry nope he doesnt have the look they need someone older cause this ain t it chief in my opinion.
itshould just be a different witcher not geralt.
hard pass on netflix in general. they cant be trusted with the witcher series.
I never did like game of thrones its so desperate to be controversial. no class at all. if I was gonna do nudity in a fantasy epic then gimme some boris vallejo stuff thunder thighs and battle boobs  fur underwear etc. not emillia clarke and dinklage.
hello! honestly they destroyed my dreams when announced some one changing story trying to     with some of their own when lack of creativity taking other people art and retelling the story makes me mad and netflix allowing that and of course the problem isn t the one changing story so the main character actor fires himself ok. thats the point of the pittiest cinema movies and series had come.
why not play a different character
this shows dead after season 3. I have no interest in watching anything else witcher related without cavill. smh.
I feel like in the past people made art and entertainment from a place of passion and excitement. now I feel like its just made for agendas and money grabs  even video games! you used to be able to buy the game and enjoy the game. now you have to buy the game and everything within it as well lol
he ll be known as  soyboy geralt.
looks like  goth thor ...   go figure.
a lot of art is made with sadness although this is made from passion ironically just a very misguided one
it quite honestly doesnt matter who they hired because the writers are trash  no matted who s acting the show would be bad. season 1 and 2 sucked.
Im not even going to watch that crap xd
Jesus and chill
sorry  it just looks like chris hemsworth dressed as geralt. not trying to offend liam or any fans of his  but seriously to me  it looks like chris.
am I the only to see that the hemsworth siblings are often the go to for the feminists  ghost buster  thor etc.
my perspective is liam hemsworth doesnt make very good choices  after all  he married miley cyrus.
is that black face
liam hemsworth as geralt concept art has major bI vibes lmfao.  let me be clear  not a fan
no one is gonna match cavill s voice!! hemsworth is cool and all but no man this is sad shit. when I think of the witcher cavills voice and presence is burnt in my mind.
but this will be the writing of blood origins level  so worse than primary school play.
yestrrrrlaaasnight
who the hell cares who plays geralt he s not gonna get enough screen time but the show will still be called the witcher not the yennefer or the sorceress of the lodge or whatever
anita s
I didn t feel cavill was the right fit but he ended up being the only thing good about the show. but just by looks alone this hemsworth dude just doesnt have the right look for the part at all. he looks soft.
its not like henry cavill was a great witcher.  he obviously loved the story but he is very unlike geralt. if the writing and acting is good Im down for change.
books are better please read them
no henry  no witcher. not watching it if he s not geralt
I thought they were going to use a woman as the new witcher since all are women  in the production.
I dont like it  I dont think he looks like geralt
it does not really matter. the show is nothing to do with the witcher. let him to make some money with this bs.
no it cant. end of story
terrible.sure  they can stick another actor in a white wig and get him on  mutagens  to buff him up but we all know why its a different actor  thats the problem.they needed an actor who didn t care what they did to the witcher  they want it woke  they wanna butcher the story  and I refuse to watch it happen.
Im still not watching
honestly no one is going to watch it anyway. they killed the entire ip already.
hold up  she still using windows 10
nobody wants the switcher.
your not a real gamer if you cant play thru death stranding.
liam hemsworth should stay away from this burning garbage  save yourself from netflix  otherwise people will just hate him for taking the job  even if he had no bad intentions. either go make a good witcher adaptation  or dont take it with netflix
am I the only one who thinks liam looks like he is in blackface  who did his make-up  it looks ridiculous.
1st
season 4 of the witcher   a big flop
no  it cant work and it wont. witcher is dead
hemsworth fan or not is still your basic dont rock the boat actor I dont see him being objective of the writing.he is a typical hollywood drone.
no it cant work and dont watch it
