grats on 60k!we are fortunate to have independent creators right now. corporate manipulation of data  even down to reviews  goes unchecked otherwise
speaking of disney  noticed how their quality of films went down after their contract ended with paramount pictures  black widow went from guns and choking people out  to attempting to attack thanos with two sticks. marvel has become so watered down  and that has everything to do with disney and their family friendly morales
yup. the only numbers we have come from the companies themselves. of course they re gonna lie. none of us can prove they are lying without suing them  and we certainly dont have enough money to try with disney or amazon. thanks for always giving us great content melonie and grats on 60k.  Im so happy for you with how much this channel has grown this last month.
maybe jameela was talking about bots when she said the target audience was happy... that actually makes a lot more sense.
amazon was major suss when they declared however many billion or so supposedly saw rings of power. on the day it premiered I noticed that when you logged in the show would start in an ad and all you had to do was click. I bet they counted views as any log in thatsaw the ad. these companies cant be trusted. great video. smart and beautiful as always melonie.
thank you for reporting this  melonie. I really appreciate your news updates and views on current media trends. sad to see so much corporate corruption out there.  but glad we have people like yourself brave enough to stand up and say something about it. stay true  always. new sub.
keep up the great work melonie!! glad to see creators that canthink on their own  3
its unreal how viewer data can be manipulated  but cash flow is cash flow  you cant legally manipulate that. Im in media sales for a local broadcast station  and Ive seen several competitors fudge numbers to paint their business in a better picture but its all smoke and mirrors. got to follow the cash. it will always tell the truth.
sure its messing up numbers  do they ever say well maybe our show just sucks. . this video was a good one. I like all this fact checking a research you did for this. keep that up.
well looks like the board of directors have some explaining to do with the shareholders. congrats on 60k subs!
I am certain that the shows you enumerated are number 1 on their respective streaming platforms but by those numbers its less probable.
congratulationson 60k subscribers melonie yay!!!!  so youre saying its your fault because of the ad you did.just kidding! yes youre right about this. you look beautiful  imo . take care melonie! oh and dont let you mom keep you up too later.
they re fudging their numbers what a surprise!!!
congratulations on your 60k rise keep thriving
I didn t even know this channel existed melonie. I thought you just never really posted on youtube on your other channel. cool that you do have regular content.
they used to call it lying  but I suppose thats one of the hurtful words now.
just found your channel  but Im loving it! congrats on the 60k! brazilian fan here!
sheeeesh you should be the entertainment reporting arm for ajones. I would watch your segments
the eternals   1movie in the world.ms. marvel   1show ever.netflix resident evil  best re adaptation. she hulk  best disney  show.ring of power  best streaming show ever.all of them flop... the numbers doesnt add up. I smell culinary.
I am so glad I found this girl  she s fckn awesome! been watching for a couple weeks. and so far Ive agreed with every single opinion of hers  and I feel the same way about all the topics. oh also  I love the sleeve. nothing better than a girl with ink.
with what they ve gotten away with recently  I wouldn t exactly call them  family friendly ...
facts
daredevil and bullseye will be having a tickle fight.
great point  yet everyone still watches their trash.
@mr jones  cats  not everyone.
cgI  adventure  movies need to go away
disney is about as  family friendly  as a child diddler
family friendly  is a stretch.
@mr jones  cats  well as least ms.marvel and sheshe-hulk are the two lowest rated streaming show in the mcu  so maybe things are changing.
@john durham  hope so yeah. or just end the franchise after phase 5 altogether and give planet earth a rest from these z-list characters.
@mr jones  cats  have no choice if you want to continue the story of mcu
@5m views  I have a choice and there is no story to the feminist gay mcu. you seriously think disney is still following the beats from 2008
I logged in three times to watch the boys  I bet it counted the ad as 3 views too.
@zan jayna  yep. they are fudging their numbers. honestly  amazon is the oddball streaming service  where many people have it  but they have it for free shipping. so who knows how many even watch anything there. that being said  the idea that almost half or of all their subscribers in general  all logged on during that weekend to watch it  is absurd.
I still dont understand anyone give a dislike. I dont see anything to dislike imo. keep up the good work melonie and again yay!!!!!! to 60k
you should watch critical drinker  he is book writer and pointing out why today shows is bad because of  the message . there s also a video where he rewrote she hulk origin episode to make it better.
@bobo boy  lol  oh I know all about critical drinker. great recommendation  its one of my favorite channels. love it!
wow! 60k! thats the best  melonie. congrats and keep going boom!  d
I noticed the cgI went from bad to absolutely terrible after episode 3 of shehulk. I think its because bruce banner left the show on a spaceship  so they didn t have to worry about her looking terrible by contrast when standing next to him anymore.
I got hbo max as part of my gigabit internet service. its got some good stuff on it particularly the classic Godzilla movies and the misadventures of flapjack lol
I did not know I had hbo max until I heard house of the dragon was going to be on it and didn t need to sign up.  first time I ever used it.  I have prime video only because it comes along with the free shipping.  have netflix but considering changing that  and I only get hulu a month at a time when I hear they have new letterkenny content.
I love how if I cook my books I go to jail for like 15 years but if disney does it  ehh whatever
congrats on getting to 60k melonie!
congratulations on 60k  youre awesome!!!
melonie mac  doing the media s job for them  and doing it better to boot.
young and not dumb. how refreshing. clear-headed  insightful and conservative with some trad morals. youre blowing my mind.
sitting in an office where I cant watch yet. so frustrating.  congrats on 60k though
honestly all of my friends are nerds and Im literally the only one watching she-hulk because I review it for my other channel  if I didn t I would have never watched it like how Im not watching rings of power or any of the star wars shows
hello  melonie  so streaming services worry about numbers interesting  if only they could be worry in delivering quality producs.
no wonder at t dumped wb so they wont get sued
woaa melonie looks amazing!
I definitely agree with youmelonie I hope your enjoyingyour weekend thus far takecare melonie
discovery needs to find more revenue streams. they should be making money on just merchandising dc and looney tunes characters alone  so why aren t they
lol I think its hilarious they stand so tough but when shit fails they resort to cheating..  its like playing my lil cousin in nba 2k
they think we are stupid. clearly  some of us are.
Im seeing this new natural approach in regards to your looks. little-to-no-make-up melonie is the superior melonie.
the empress just released on netflix is brilliant
how does your little cousin cheat in nba2k
shocking  really shocking. Im shocked. literally shaking
an insider at disney told doomcock that over half of all disney  subscriptions are free. they re all cooking their books  and they are all in violation of their fiduciary duty.
when it comes to these streaming numbers  I am always skeptical to believe them. all these services are trying to compete against netflix and everyone is pretty much failing to get an audience. and you see them still offer discounts to subscribe  it makes me think that maybe they re desperate.
some of the recent rotten tomatoes film scores seem really sketch as well. Im looking at you woman king  and maybe bros too .
yesterday  I saw that rings of power was in my  continue watching  list on prime... I haven t watched a single minute of thatshow. hmmm...
not surprising  especially in the case of rop.  a lot of people figured amazon was fudge the fuck out of their numbers because they invested an obscene amount of money to make thatshow and literally couldn t afford to have it fail even though it absolutely deserves to.
love it melonie
subbed because you keep popping up in my feed and I like your content.
tbh it doesnt matter if they are faking numbers if we have no way of finding out as that is the same data that advertisers and stakeholders will be using. I personally trust nielsen but who knows these days.
wait  she-hulk fudged the numbers up after we all read the article about nielsen soundscan not even charting she-hulk   seriously
shows have done this before. its just that we the norms  have access to way more information than ever before. so now a lot of the old scams and traditions are coming into the light
well done
studios be trying to gaslight us! resist!!
I dont know how successful they think they are. but Im not seeing she-hulk knock-offs on etsy  or galadriel fanfics on amazon
mac   steph real life collaboration when
so we ve reached a point where lying is portrayed as something normal and completely fine. humanity is  progressively  deteriorating. weren t we supposed to make progress and evolve further  how come the movement who talks about progression slowly makes us decline instead  people used to tell me Im exaggerating but just think of recent events and you know Im right. like the story about thatswedish convict jeremy meeks who got released from prison because a lot of women found him  too hot to be in prison . it also makes me remember the story about one black dude who tried to kill a woman and her children but  activists  marched for his inoccence because he was black. society has become degenorate. we are on stept ahead of turning a second sodom   gomorrha. we are already at a point where we even condone attempted murder just because of a person s skin color. we even have women who  share  their boyfriend with their underaged daughter. drugs are slowly becoming legal in several  advanced  countries. freedom of speech is basically non-existent anymore. only in theory. amazon already proved what happens to opinions that dont align with theirs. prohobiting freedom of speech is basically what cancel culture is all about. at this point  I wouldn t even be surprised if soon sodomy will become legal.
every month they ll say this is the number one film for every movie that comes out to a point that the words number one end up feeling like nothing  pointless in other words.the words number one feels more like a cliche then a truth at at times.
alright  alright! a new video!
what ever amount hbo max fudges their numbers by  amazon fudges their numbers by 3-4 times as much.
here s the thing that tickles me pink - even if they lie about the numbers  its not doing them any good  because the numbers aren t actually there. so  why lie about them  all they do is maybe save some face. the money still got wasted.
not even mad at her for thinking that the shows thatshe dislike are actually doing well because nobody wants to be wrong especially when does it fit there narrative  about go woke go broke thing.
physical media is much better anyway.let s make that 60k 100k all in due time.
damn  I didn t get my expresso tomb raider reference today mel  d
profligate is said like profliget or profligut  basically. not a criticism or anything - its somewhat of an uncommon word.
amazon  stopped reviews  btw  . on there site  . deleted them or delayed them for days even weeks .   ofcourse they did the writers and directors  the showrunners have almost 0 experience . amazon hired the cheapest people to make rings of power
I will say  I know a few people who ve genuinely told me they find trop to be actually enjoyable. however  I work and live in an extremely liberal and leftist area  so it doesnt surprise me so many of those around me are willfully looking past the show s many obvious flaws and blatant disrespect of its source material.as someone who s fairly middle-of-the-road or absent  politically speaking  all I care about is tolkien as an ingenious creator and visionary. it isn t like some comic book franchise thats had dozens of writers over the decades and has zero creative integrity. if they changed anything or took creative license at all with tolkien lore and middle-earth  I am against that. I dont much care what they changed. nothing needed to be changed or added to begin with  its really thatsimple for me. I felt the same way about those shadow of mordor video games  just nah bruh. nah.
hey. you look friggin great. I love the make-up change.
there is zero buzz for these shows in real life or online
she-hulk is probably fake  that list they showed excluded house of the dragon lol its like I win because the real winners aren t allowed here
yeah  this happened in the music industry 10 years ago - diffusion  digital  no transparency  no verification  endless new measurements  rankings  blather  bs. so  wb and others are doing the same  but where its legally discoverable and consequential is 1  knowingly misleading investors and shareholders  earnings calls  sec filings  public statements by executives etc  2  any valuation that goes into dd for a business deal  acquisition  divestment  whatever 3  any valuation based on the streaming numbers etc which involves making an attestation to a bank  fund  or other lender in order to borrow  goes to viability  going concern  collateral  overall cap ratios .  lying to the public or consumers  doesnt matter   or at least they seem to be able to do it with impunity  but lie to a lender or major shareholder  and yeah  yr in legal jeopardy.
a1  100  another great take. also coming from a heterosexual male  hides from everything coming to hurt me just by saying that  I like your nails.  gotta say they really suit you.
its very encouraging to see women standing up against this shit as well. kudos ma am.
so does this mean that the game of thrones numbers might not be as high as they claimed
I dare you to spoof as reboot lara for halloween since you despise her so much its halloween right  reboot lara would definitely fit into the scared and afraid aesthetic
definitely some bamboozling  but also  people are being horn-swaggled.
God only knows what s real or not. all I know is  Im so happy Im done with star wars and marvel and I dont want any part of rop. house of dragons  is awesome!
Im loving u without makeup. its my preferred look for you personally
keep speaking the truth melonie resist wokeness
finally  you switched out the awful mugshot.  I dont care thatstreaming shows cook the demographic books--Im just happy your channel is even easier on the eyes.if youre irritated by how the old hats are managing their affairs by being bought off  why not goof with anna on a creative project to inspire the new ones
I like how you think.  more and more each day lol.
ah the classic  lie with statistics  issue.it is why with numbers I hate vagueness in every manner. like being given just a percentage but no number to take from that percent to actually get the full picture. it is easy to paint anything with a percentage good or bad as long as you omit key information. though I will admit that people can still get a horrible view even with all the information because people just hate math and have innate negative views with something like a disease having a 100  increase  when in actuality with the right information that increase could easily have just been one whole number up  but mathematically it is right.
maybe the make-up is just different today  but melonie is looking  even  more attractive than usual...
if hbomax wants to improve   then perhaps   they should make their app work good ! ! !
if we analyze this series without remembering the books  this series is still dragged  full of clich s  lazy solutions  bad performances and cheap. they dont seem to have invested 1 billion dollars.
well when the investors see the real numbers they are going to be fudging their pants.
hilariously so they wouldn t have to be fudging numbers if they just stopped playing hard to get and gave customers what they wanted  biggest example in the case of wb... snyderverse
I never hear people talking about these shows so whatever they get these numbers from  well you already know
boom with no eye makeup.... natural beaut.
melonie macncheese bringing it
she-dunk sports report coming soonwhere my dog at ! !
but logic and common sense are just conspiracy theories!
warner bros has become an absolute mess. they re very arsey when it comes to their content being used as well. defently cant make revenue talking about warner bros. properties. a simple image can stop you from making a cent. they should take the opportunity of marvel s downfall and reinvent what a blockbuster movie is - but its warner bros  I wouldn t expect that from them.
when s your next twitch
0 35 -  can I borrow your  uh... wig  please  step-joker
I love Lord of the rings  I tried watching the new show  after 2 weeks and im only 1 2 way through the 2nd episode.  its so bad  I just dont care.  I get so bored that I can only give it like 15 minutes at a time . its so bad  its like  hard to watch.  so disappointing.ive come to believe that with all these woke remakes reboots whathaveyou  its not even about making money off these tried and proven shows movies  its about destroying anything and everything that bring people together  outside of politics  they want to destroy our culture  make everything in the world neutral and identical.  american is the  1 target.. its existence gives people all over the world in worse conditions proof that things can be better  that there is another way  that its possible  they get rid of thatshining city on the hill and why would anyone think they have it worse than anyone else  they have no example to look to.. to give them hope.make sure y all keep on lighting those brushfire of freedom in the minds of men.
Im glad these dumpster fire shows exist so channels like this can roast them.
of course they have to fudge the numbers because their shows tanked and bombed big time.   look how good we are corporate mentality at its finest  .
they can literally say anything how on earth will we know lmfao they can say anything is  1 or is this out of this out of 10 or whatever just look at rotten tomatoes they used to be a reliable source to go to to get information on how a movie is being receivednow everything is 100  like give me a break
melonie when you doing q and a
girl you look tired. why dont you give this stuff a break for a bit and veg out  and get some rest. good content as always though
or at least do more streams. simpcast is getting boring. I only watch when she s on. fnt has too guests  as does flashcast. the jack show gets way too juvenile for her.
I dont know a single person watching or talking about she hulk.
people got tired of woke shit. calling us names stopped being effective ages ago.
keep the makeup off - youre a natural beauty.
these streaming services are worst than cable packages...
yep they re all lying poses
this comes as a surprise to absolutely no one.
did you just say its gaslighting to say something is performing well
why would anybody be surprised at this revelation  they re desperate because nobody likes their awful shows. this level of dishonesty and gaslighting is to be expected from these people. its one of the reasons I dont give them my money at all  as a rule.
does everything have to be fake
I was on my high horse taking a stand  saying I will never give money to disney   because of their treatment of star wars... nope  I will stick to my guns  they ll never have me as a customer... then I discovered I already had disney   because I got it free with my unlimited cell phone plan... stupid dead high horse!
I get free netflix from t-moblie... lol
which with any luck the sec will want to look at.
hopefully the scc fines them for reporting wrong and false number of subscribers
what s y all s favorite pastry
what s the tat on your right bicep
who the hell is this lady pretending to be melonie
never believed any of their numbers. its too easy to manipulate and skew.

damn girl how bright is your monitor or are you not front lit
y is this an issue... fudging the data does it really matter esp. to non- investors pple really bothered by she-hulk having a w
you can see the ring light in her eyes dude.
@mungeparty  well I cant get your face out of your phone
every tech company is lying about their popularity. massively so.
if we are still talking about crap corporate content  yes... we are stupid.
thought you were gonna talk about how rings of powah raised 2 points in their ratings in the last 3 days....  not gonna lie tho  their last episode was their best yet.... still some bad characters and overall just shit extras.....
Im still at the door of not believing the box office figures put out about capt marvel  black panther and rise of skywalker. everyone lies.
10 million   compared to what   I hate it when they quote numbers without saying how it is compared.  itseems like every company cooks their books to some extent.  also it is an established fact that accounting is not 100 .  if that 10 million is 1  no one cares.  but it is not.  their total is around 90 million.  that is over 10 .  that matters.
well if there is an entity that is monitoring and suing companies  then it is clear that the company that are not being sued  must be doing a pretty good job of giving correct data.... however since the lawsuit is about the cost for a merge purchase then it is more about over paying based of market share then about any individual show...also anyone in this nation can file suit  it doesnt require any evidence or proof of wrong doing to file the lawsuit...  for example  trump is suing cnn  he is probably going to sue the state of new york and if the supreme court doesnt move on his behalf  he may sue them as well..  it doesnt mean there is a valid case!
yup fake numbers and fake facts...
okokokokok do favor!  find out if captain marvel really hit a billion...that was...really f ing fast  right ! anybody !.....just me !
well thats ironic . I only have hbo max because of my internet package  I dont even bother to use it but it was included. claiming me  and people like me  as  subscribers  is rather sad yet amusing.
there is no way disney and amazon did not do that too  or something similar . Im just ending up watching your channel because movies and series are mostly crap now
I fail to care at this point. this behavior is predictable and expected.
please  review  star trek discovery for any no regard to cost or profit attitude and while you are at it how this fake star trek ripped off a game creator.
research. the wokies kryptonite. lies never last forever. the truth will always be revealed.
both she-hulk and ring of power shows are bad  tho I think ring of power should be higher than she-hulk. who even watches that greenface show  !  dif we talk about house of the dragons - show is decent - 10x better than both greenface and ring without power shows...
yea like when angry joe kept getting harassed because he kept putting out reviews about the halo show that fucking sucks. they kept claiming copyright on all his videos  it was ridiculous.
aaaaa yoo
we re fecking stupid for paying subscriptions to watch these shows. imagine how pissed the investors will be knowing this information has gotten out  especially with the mouse in the rotten sjw house.
no their not
they think it matters  its just a tv show  one of many throw away garbage programmes . made by overpaid. undertalented overhyped flash in the pan amateurs. stop wasteing your energy and intellect on this and figure out what youre being distracted from in the real world
