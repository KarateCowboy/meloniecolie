ever notice how this nonsense never happens when the show is good  almost like the show can speak for itself.
calling me a racist isn t going to get me to watch your program.  calling me a sexist isn t going to get me to watch your program.  what would get me to watch your program is a full apology  firing everyone and starting over again with a show that holds true to the lotr lore.
even when we say   I just dont like it   the actors will still label it as racist and misogynistic. this is just crazy.
the one thing that this show has absolutely highlighted is that the actor s talentlessness is only exceeded by their arrogance.
rings of amazon producers  look at the races of our actors and characters!rings of amazon actors  people keep paying attention to our races  taking attention away from our acting  story  and silkscreened underarmor costumes. this shows how far we still have to go.
its funny  because people initially complained about the race swaps for house of the dragon  and then the show came out and it was good  that complaint stopped. it turns out people are more concerned about whether or not youre telling a good story. if you tell a good story people will hardly notice.
the thought of a large corporation humbled by a fandom warms my heart.
mel mel  I think its really weird when a company goes out of their way to reconstruct something that has already been established when it comes to telling that unique story. this means that they completely undo and eradicate what has been told before it  and do some thing that they think will work with a  modern audience . I think its really funny when different companies have fall guys because they know that what they re producing is crap  but they hope it catches on. its like going into a losing war with people that are expendable.  regardless  great vid
its taken air time from the depths of who we are as artists. no  no it hasn t. artists make art  youre professional activists.
thank you for this excellent essay on current race relations  youre echoing my own thoughts much better than I could ever state them. people aren t pokemon  we dont need to collect them all. it makes as much sense to case a black actor as a tolkien elf as it would to cast elijah wood as black panther. Ive seen several black people react to these articles with a  wait  I wasn t supposed to be a tolkien fan before   its all so disgusting. keep fighting this fight!
manufactured division  spot on  melonie!
I hate this constant lie that people and media push where people and society is just against poc leads  characters and so on. that having one is some sort of incredible ground breaking event when that is not reality at all in anyway. nobody cares or has issues with a poc lead or character in general its when lore  cannon and existing chars are changed that people have issues.
I know someone personally who works close to people at amazon and well  its basically a disaster according to them  which we all knew  but its somewhat satisfying knowing the people  inside  know their show sucks and are currently trying to cover up the pr shit-storm. there s a reason they wont report on viewership numbers I ll just say that lol
awesome video again.  Im reminded by a george carlin bit where he said   thats how the ruling class acts in any society  keep the lower classes fighting among themselves while they keep going to the bank.  keep up the great work melonie!
great video! the simple fact that amazon  and hollywood in general  seem to forget is that we are not their slaves and are free to spend our time   money on what we like! not what they want to us to consume.
imagine the backlash if they got danny devito to play elektra.  I thought you wanted marginalized groups to get represented  dwarfism is the most marginalized  just ask peter dinklage with snow white.
I am a brown guy from canada. I never had to identify as a brown guy before... society made me to know that this needs to be known now a days. I just never really thought of being different from any other human being. when I was a kid and I got to read superman comics. I thought of having super powers was cool and having a hero who fights crime was a cool concept. I never once thought... hmm... I wonder if he would be brown.. I just didn t care for representation.. a story when rewritten and talks about the show and what s the purposes or goal is what gets my attention... if a character in a show are busy chewing themselves out or has to come out due to their sexuality kind of makes the show die off because no one came to see that.   well.. 1 percent of population only.. and itsucks that the world caters to them    everyone came to enjoy a plot and how the story is carried and that is about it.
the wga just sent me the awards screener codes for rings of power  and I was like  awards push   youre out of your mind
the irony is that the overwhelming consensus Ive heard is that the black female dwarf was the best part of the show. people acknowledged that hey  even though it was a ridiculous childish woke insert  she did a good job in her role. she was even popping off the most woke bromides amongst the cast too  yet people gave her props.
amazon be all like   please clap.
like... the peripheral and the expanse... seems amazon should stick to just buying up sci-fI properties...
precisely right. you dont see tom cruise constantly defending himself or top gun maverick in every entertainment web site  podcast  review site  etc.
mysterious
the casting would still be inaccurate pandering.
you haven t heard much about house of the dragon because it was considered a good show. you dont see the actors of thatshow attacking their audience. you also dont see fans still complaining about any black targaryens cause they didn t feel out of place  and again  the show was good and fans were focusing on that
@static charm  spoilers for hotd!  I was against it for reasons of character portrayal. in the book lanor s coloration is almost the same as rhaenyra s so the rumors of their children s paternity rested solely upon their hair color. the explanation being that the kids must have inherited rhaenyra s maternal grandfather s hair color  he was an arryn  giving her a certain amount of plausible deniability. by making lanor dark skinned it portrays rhaenyra as stupider or more arrogant than her book characterization. also in the book it is explained that lanor was able to  do the deed  but couldn t get her pregnant hinting that he was infertile giving her an extra reason to have kids by someone else. being the heir to the throne she needed children to secure that position. in the end tho Im fine with it if grrm is fine with it but that extra characterization puts me in camp green for the show when in the book I am camp black.
@adam  true but people are much more likely to overlook it if the show is actually good. I personally think black elves and dwarves make absolutely no sense within the realm of tolkien but if the show wasn t utter garbage I wouldn t care who portrayed what character.
@adam white  exactly. I think it could be thematic to have  different  dwarves and elves. heck every rpg  video game  has racial sub races for non humans. of course  they just need to be homogeneous groups  thats the only thing that makes sense. but none of us would have any problem it.
@fig jam  I took the route of  wikI the book   so I know the basics but not the nitty gritty details. Ive seen complaints that the velaryons were sidelined in the show and thus  making them black felt to be a little bit of being in poor taste I guess  I still have some hopes that baela and rhaena will grow to greater prominence in season 2  as to my understanding they do take on a slightly larger role when the war kicks off. Imyself had mixed feelings about it before I read a more detailed reason as to why they did it as well as actually see some episodes. so far the only two I have liked are adult laenor  the friendship he had with rhaenrya was great  I enjoyed their dialogue   and corlys. especially corlys  the actor did an excellent job and him and rhaenys are an a  power couple imo. p.s. I heard a rumor that the first episode of the next season is titled  blood and cheese.  if thats true . audience reaction is going to be on a whole different level lol.
the lore of the rings we need.
nothing less!
literally! less goo
indeed  that is why I kicked star wars to the curb. they all but said they dont want people like me as fans.
you are under the assumption that actors cant afford to not learn from the same mistake done over and over like normal people. also an apology wont make this series even marginally decent. if they focused 10  of the effort they put into insulting their fans  the series might even... not be a mess.
more of the insanity of hollywood when would any business ever insult their customer then expect customers to do business with them
Im not watching it even then
exactly... just present us a show that is faithful to the lore and we will watch it.
@rockhopper_392  I gave itsome thought  and I think a big part of the problem is that there is this relatively new trend  thats a hostile take over of geek culture by sjw s. these considerations are foreign to us. they re trying to fix what we love by breaking it.and you know what  I can get along with most identity politics geeks just fine. they re enthusiastic about what they love as we are about what we love. kind of. but let s not kid ourselves. this has nothing to do with social justice  and everything to do about virtue signalimg for financial gain.either way  these people dont love tolkien  they dont love  the witcher   they dont love  star wars   and they seem to just barely be able to stand us  the fans.
as a black person who read the books  and who is the stand of Lord of the rings  I can say  I did not see myself  or anyone that looks like me a part of thatstory  or was even welcome to be a part of thatstory you as a white woman never have to guess are still not included  because you are always included representation is important and Im happy about it and I love the show
thats the only way they ll be able to look at this as anything other than a billion dollar mistake. just ignore this season  say it was a one off fan fic or whatever and start over and make it good. quit worrying about identity politics. its getting old  and they have done nothing but lose money the more they do that. and adding to the racial tensions in america. I would never be ok with our kids being looked down on cause they were born white  black  mexican  or any other race. its such a bad approach
we need a lot more people to say this.
why do actors always assume that people are racist just because they dont like something
@freakr x  because they re trying to play up that you must like it to polarize identities.  rich people think this
their egos are monumental.
its the new norm if you dont like something its because youre some type of ist its never the fault of those associated with what you dont like.
no but they will usually actively look for 1 person saying the really bad stuff  and use it to group all criticism into that 1 or 2 extreme cases  sometimes they will even use fake account to make up the really nasty stuff to use as an excuse.
they are all no bodies  and after this  show  ends  they will all still be no bodies.
@angel phoenix77  while I do not like this show at all  in my opinion it is not fair to blame the actors. a brilliant actor can lift up a bad movie. but the incompetence of the writers in this series is at a level where even brilliant actors would look pathetic. remember the stone ship seqoence. I dare say  that there is no possible way to deliver thatscene without looking stupid as an actor.
@draxx gecko  you might have had a point. its the actors resses that is going out of their way to attack the fans.
@draxx gecko  dunno man  I think with this one  a good actor could ve fooled people into thinking its good.like how the tom-something guy that plays lokImade people think his series was good  it wasn t the story would still suck  but the more easily distracted people would have had a harder time catching up.
tokens books sold millions of copies around the world without them what audacity to say we make the original creators books better because where in them
I just say that the female dwarfs do not have beards.  where s their representation
ghostbusters  star wars  star trek  doctor who  classic disney  etc etc etc fans  first time
I notice.  one whiffed that crap and Im out. didn t watch got. haven t watched hotd. dont plan to either.
in cowboy bebop a lot of people complained about jet black being race swapped... until they noticed that was the better casted of all the actors and enjoyed his performance  even when the rest of the show fell apart
it probably also helped that unlike in rop  hotd actually a legitimate reason that made sense in that fantasy world why those people were of those races.
it also helped that the race swap was an entire house  instead of just sprinkling random black people all through the setting. there are still some logical problems - the valerians and targeryns were supposed to be interbreeding extensively  and you sure cant see it - but its still much easier to swallow then just random black extras in westerous. also  Im probably spelling this stuff wrong  whatever.
@zephyr    yeah whatever  but yeah  that helps too. both things are evidence they made an attempt to make having dark-skinned people in the story make sense in the world they built  instead of just throwing them in there just to crow about being  diverse .
and most of the rop criticism is about the portrayal of galadriel and harfoots. almost nobody complain about the actor s race  just their performance and story  dialogue.
with you on that
defo
@booming bob   had no clue what that meant and to look it up lol
they would never ever be a comparison to peter jacksons work. so I refuse to watch the bs. on amazon.
@mr cage242  the word defo
@booming bob  yeah
@mr cage242  oh I just shortened definitely oop
@booming bob   oh lol
@mr cage242  yeah lol
yeah  why the hell would I  if I am part of this  modern audience    even watch a tv show based on tolkien s work that itself was based on ancient northern european folklore. we want authenticity  not this  modern  nonsense.if it truly was a great series  then people would have watched it despite all the woke stuff. but it was crap!
@mick ratters  yeah you saw house of the dragon and race wasn t an issue why do you think that was after itstarted because it was actually bloody good and the dwarf was the best part ironically who would ve guess attacking the fan wouldn t work  nothing says wanting to watch season 2 like insulting the fans
exactly  tolkien already stated that he wrote this to be the sort of official british mythology to go along with the great empire much like all great civilizations have have before it like the greeks and egyptians. all peoples are welcome to enjoy  read  watch and be fans  there was never any segregation in that. why feel the need to mess with that. like all the millions of black people weren t already fans
not to mention  there are countries based on the middle east and africa in middle-earth  but do we get stories there  nope. guess its too hard to actually learn about those cultures and building those up with their own stories. plus  still haven t heard anyone rushing to remake the earthsea series with the proper casting. that miniseries was whitewashed  supposed to be polynesian and native american peoples  but I guess they re at the bottom of the victim totem pole  only brought out to be paraded around from time to time.
@amanda pizzolatto  they recently tried  and the best they could do with the woman king was to make slavers be the heroes lmao!
will smith movies  almost always super popular and well-liked  though he s definitely got a few stinkers .denzel washington  same. morgan freeman  same. samuel l. jackson  sidney poitier  eddy murphy  halle berry  etc  etc  etc.oh  but you dont like this movie show that has a black character in it  clearly youre just a racist!I can absolutely 100  guarantee that the people who are quick to point fingers and scream   ist!  phobe!  dont always like every single thing that features a character of the race sexuality gender whatever that they re claiming to defend that week. but to admit that would be to admit that its just an act to them  and they aren t willing to do that.
@wumpusrat  morgan freeman  the man hated by the woke because of his commentaries on waicism. just dont talk about it he made it  so other black men can as well  and they did.
this comment needs to be seen more
the problem is that the amazon executives dont think the show sucks because of their decisions  they think the show sucks because of the people who did the show. and that wont change the way they think about book adaptations  that maybe they should try to stay a little bit more faithful to the source material and not trying to rewrite what has been written  what millions of fans love and then be angry about that the fans hate their adaptation which they butchered because of some modern agenda. for them it is the traditional case of am I so out of touch  no. its the racist fans who are wrong.
@starfish 25  honestly  I think they already know that there are mostly no racist aspect in audience criticism. they just make these narrative to pretend they dont make failed series.  our show is not bad  but the racists make people not watching  its their fault
@starfish 25  they blame the fans for being racist honestly idc about the race changes etc but the story and the lore breaking is terrible who would think changing the great already written story would be in need of change the rings of power sucked mainly bc of the writing and directing the actors are all fine but the script is just not it
@ad bylsh  they do  they have whole promos showing the changes they made and why they think its better than tolkien. if tolkien was alive he would be pissed for sure.
@joe hockey player  I believe tolkien s son didn t like the jackson trilogy because  he turned them into superheroes  or smth.imagine if he had lived 2 years longer  and seen guylladriel tank a volcano blast. instant heart failure.
well thats like us white guys. when I was a kid  I grew up watching the jefferson s  sanford and son  family matters  fat albert  beverley hills cop  and later on blade with wesley snipes  and so on  and I cannot ever once anyone talking about the skin color of any of those shows  and this was me in rural louisiana. the show was either good or itsucked. period. but man  today is just insane. skin color is everything.
what s next  a surcharge on one s prime account for not leaving positive reviews all across the internet
great vod  mel! continue to speak your mind! I hope you are not feeling stressed and overwhelmed anymore because of all the hate that has been going your way lately and Im sorry about the endometriosis coming back  thatsucks.
yay! new video. good to see you melonie. I hope youre doing well. praying
they haven t been relevant for over a month and their show is being ignored. they cant keep grifting forever that their vastly unpopular show is disliked for that reason whilst hotd has been vastly successful
man I just stumbled across this channel and started watching some of the vids. melonie is incredibly beautiful and not about this woke nonsense we living in rn. Im just shook I really thought everyone was about this new agenda crap. this gives me motivation to seek out more likeminded because Im going crazy trying to talk to other people who are stuck in the matrix.
I think its offensive that they would even call themselves  artists
melonie the new superman. I can see it now. this is such a good video. I love seeing melonie smile and laugh. always good to see.great vidoe melonie. take care and have fun today.
you dont reshape history. you make history!
thank you !  you seriously give me a bit of hope for the younger generation
omg  thats some next level self entitlement there. not even on children I saw so much of it.
love your videos and speak your mind. the most realist content on youtube.
I didn t like your story  what are you racist  that response is just a massive cope lol
there was a time when putting someone that wasn t relatable to the audience in either a heroic or sympathetic position was a way to break barriers. this was the notion of subverting expectations that worked for movies like shrek  where ogres could be  good   or at least seen as misunderstood  rather than evil. its also used in criminal mystery shows to throw people off who might already be convinced that one suspect is the killer  but it turns out to be the person least expected. there are many ways to subvert expectations that can be profitable  and the audience might enjoy  but race  gender  etc. swapping  just for the sake of it is not one of them  and is far worse when insulting the fans for not wanting to go along with the nonsense.
where did you get your medals  daddy  ukraine   amazon prime.
its gonna make me sound like a dork  but when I hear these people talking about wanting  badges  I immediately imagine them being the inquisitorial squad under umbridge from harry potter  are we the baddies   that meme even more so
Im so glad we at least got chainsaw man now after all this.they clearly didn t give an f about  modern western sensibilities  when making it. thats why its actually good.
a lot of people that play part of these shows often dont even know the real materials. special tolkiens works are very specific on how his char s looks like.
melonie mac cast as new superman stated in an interview   deep down  I have always felt that I was superman.  so  this made me perfect for this role. media replies   stunning and so brave!   finally  a superman that represents our modern values!
their narcissism is on full display.
mel  I think you playing  clarkette kent  and superman would be pretty interesting.your love interest would be lorne lane  and your newspaper buddy could be jane olsen.  peggie white.this could be great.
and with this  they ll be easily forgettable for their performance whom nobody would remember them in this show...... they were hoping to get the same accolades like how the whole peter jackson casts got.... lol.
it is just keeping the attention till the reward season is over as they think they deserve an emmie for their turd.
soon as I read that   I was like my gosh.    artist   not even close.
hackivist
I d watch melonie as the new superman.  especially if she gets to determine who the villains are.  watching melonie giving superman-strength flagpole-hanging wedgies to the hollyweird oligarchs is a movie I d watch at least twice at full price.
haaaaa hahahahaaaaaaaaa!!!!or  lol z  if one prefers
everyone needs more thomas sowell in their educational material.
divide   conquer is the oldest rule in the book  you are quite right this is manufactured conflict. as to the actors  I dont know if they are really this far up themselves or this is more  acting  they are being paid to do.
Im a new fan and subscriber...appreciate you publicly stating you are a Christian
thanks for these videos. Ive been watching various videos for months now on this subject  and it never gets old watching all of this bastardization get exposed and trashed and your channel is probably my favorite of all. I d totally watch you in the color purple.  go on a campaign that anybody who doesnt like it is racist and sexist! you could play danny glover s part and go on brie larson level campaign on ist and phobe because of the minor change in the character.  and it would be no different from what we re getting over the last few years....representation by use of over the top stereotypes is not representation.  its adding to the problem. love ya melonie!!
ty melonie for fighting the good fight!
it used to be when someone said they dont like the changes  the response was  then dont watch it  and that was that. nowadays when someone says the same thing  they get name-called and insulted and gaslit. what happened  my guess  mainstream media and film companies realized that the previous response doesnt help them get seats in the theater.
same thing  different day  and the definition of insanity comes to mind. I still couldn t care less about this series  and all the insulting me in the world wont change that. I couldn t care less what color characters are in any given movie series--john amos  a black man  had a prominent role in  the beastmaster  as a bad ass warrior monk and it didn t faze me at all back in the day  and itstill doesnt. his character was really cool and since I was a fan of his from watching  good times  back in the day  I thought it was really cool to see him in that movie. how does that make me  racist   again  I d like to know.
your in depth knowledge of what the government truly wants makes you so beautiful and amazing. your on point. they want us week and to control us.
the fact they actually think they deserve badges and plaques is funny at first... then it actually gets worrying because these people do actually have influence and are being given platforms to speak.
wow  what a great idea! they should remake the color purple with an all white cast. Imean   since skin color has no bearing upon a role or the portrayal of a character. Im sure jessica chastain or isla fisher would be able to tell celie s story just as effectively as whoopI did  maybe better  since apparently I need to be able to  see myself  in a story in order to relate to it emotionally. and it would finally be appealing to that  wider audience  because not very many white folks saw it the first time around or had the opportunity to express how deeply we relate to our shared experiences with slavery and abuse. no  thats not insulting at all. Im sure whoopI will have nothing to say about it. she never speaks up like that.
cor what a cop out. the plot was so twisted and messed with it actually felt creepy to watch for me. I dont know if that was their mission statement  to make people like me find watching it creepy  lol
let s not have a double standard here ...couldn t have said it better!
the actress sounds like a totally humble and level headed individual you could have a beer with.
100  agreed!   great video melonie!
I love thay youread the silmarillion. its dry but obviously the start of it all. where did you think it diverged the most
the fame bubble is full of people who believe the only role of the fan is to give unconditional homage and fund their stellar lifestyle
thanks for the heads up  ps  you probably didn t intend this  but you kinda have a tifa lockhart look going on  you look great
just dont mention house of the dragon  where there was also race swapping but because the show was good  no one cared about the race swap...no medals were needed
erase the tolkien pretense  make a fantasy world of diverse characters  and put them in a world with great writing and plot then you ll have none of the backlash of amazons billion dollar fanfic.
I like this artist. very animated and intelligent
super hero movies are big  lets do black panther with a white lead. break those boundries  Im sure everyone would love that.
@haruka may  well we do have to reflect how the world really is. so  I have no issue with this.
Im still hoping for a remake of jackie chan s drunken master 2 but I d prefer all mexicans.
oh wow I love it haha. thank you!
love your videos  but would you consider bringing back  verse of the day    it was the best!
amazon will have to buy me a 20 piece mcnuggies  per episode  in order to entice me to watch this show.
as someone who was in acting I can say that actors are not artists. you play pretend. youread words other people wrote. thats it. I detest this attitude that many have in that industry.
that reminds me the sonic first trailer reaction. when the fans complained that the hedgehog didn t looked like what they expected... thatstudio didn t called them  racist  for that  d they did the right thing  acknowledged that the critics were legitimate and then explained that it wasn t their intention to destroy what the fans loved. after that they even did their best to take into account the critics and change what seemed to be the problem.those netflix  disney and amazon show are the opposite of that. they buy the rights to something with a lot of fans.then they choose one of those idiots with very caricatural views on genders and races  who hates or doesnt care about the source material. that brilliant idiot comes up with some brilliant ideas like   we are going to make black panther white  and puts some profound message like  all blacks are white haters .and when the inevitable backlash comes they just try to shame and insult the people who were the main reason why the thing was popular.they are not even trying to do something good. they just seem to care for that very vocal minority of idiots with caricatural views about society.
I cant believe this point even has to be made wtf kinda world do we live in holy shit.
they re literally butthurt no one is talking about their  epic transformative life-changing show.
new video!! great to see you melonie
half the time without realizing it. I stop paying attention to what melanie is talking about. and end up on some random side quest thinking bout how pretty she is..like virtually no make mind you..but the color purple thing was hilarious
I cant relate to the character unless they look like me me  a white guy watching luther  he s literally me
and as I have quoted many times before  oh  what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive.  meaning that when you act dishonestly you are initiating problems  and a domino structure of complications  which will eventually run out of control.
7 00 I have two quotes for this.  a nation divided is a nation easily conquered.  america will never be destroyed from the outside. if we lose our freedoms it will be because we have destroyed ourselves from within.
when you hire activists instead of writers instead of interesting stories  you get lectures. I dont go to the movies to be lectured  I go to be entertained. which means  at this point  I dont go
I feel sorry for these people  they didnt even get paid that great  and for some of them its their first big project they will be exposed in  and theyve been duped into this race marketing and get asked about that instead of about the character and what it was like to take part in this production   and by the sounds of it they dont get asked because it was a shitshow  in the writing room and the characters are irrelevant to the overall story just tokens
would be great to see you on bounding into comics  black pill stream!!
Ive never heard of someone doing before.  if you dont watch my show youre an asshole.  oh no!!!!
negative promotion can get the word out for a show as much as positive promotion.  here is the reality restoretolkienverse  or get ready for a long 6 years or  ride out and meet them  the corporate machine theyocracy may have its skinny cow for now  but as we have defined on our channel in exsurge tolkien  now is the time to raise the beacons of tolkien orthodoxy and stand ready to reject any further support of rop.  to hold fast to the beautiful truth of professor tolkien s lore  legends and story  and to get educated and spread the joy of him through the tolkien-verse awash in schism. let us cross swords together and do this!.
you would make a good clark kent   spending the 2h of the moview searching for a phone cabin to change
Imiss when the mask meant  anyone could wear it and do good .
its like the halo series where instead we the halo fans got a badass soldier instead got an emotional mess who showed his face.
melonie mac as superman  I d watch it  p
that is not a bad idea at all.  mcdonalds got really expensive after replacing their floor-staff with a touch-screen computer.
do per minute to make it worth your time
word.  the amount of people Ive met that assume anthony hopkins is some super-mega-mind  because he s played super-mega-minds on film  is... it is what it is.   I bring up hopkins because one of the gossip magazines did a total hit-piece on him in like 1999  exposing him as just an average dude.
I didn t even know they did a stream  I d be happy to be on sometime
@melonie mac go boom   also  your channel is close to 100k now. will there be an event   special guests
@melonie mac go boom   yeah! every wednesday night they live stream here on youtube and talk about whatever articles! you should check it out  reach out to them- it would be totally awesome to see you on there some time!!

good point on how galadriel has gotten the most critique from people and rightfully so. so bizarre they are sticking with the  well youre just prejudice  line when you dont like this show.. I grew up loving all kinds of characters from all genders  shapes and colors. this is all so bizarre.
when the show is good itspeaks for itself if itsucks it needs a explanation why they think its good
wonder why they dont have any comment on house of the dragon s race-swapped characters or black nick fury...
to be honest I like the finale just for the galadriel and sauron bits  but yeah  the actors and actresses should just let their show speak for themselves. the fans will know if the show is made with heart. my concern here is mostly amazon using their actors as puppets. it isnt a coincidence they low balled the actors salaries and they arent even in the opening credits. im just hoping charlie vickers just stay quiet and just do his tolkien research and just do sauron the way tolkien intended. and so true. amazon went with a  message.  I truly hope they change showrunners come season 2.
decide for yourself whether you like it or not. there s too much  youre wrong to like it not like it  talk on social media and the wider press.
black person here ...never cared for Lord of the rings  but I love good fantasy. house of the dragon made the velaryons black and a lot of people disliked this at first  until they saw saw how it affected the storyline and really showed how rhaenyra s children didn t have valeryon blood.  you can make the case for the white hair  but even in the lore the white hair wasn t always an absolute. ask some of the blackfires or jon snow  plus the actor that plays corlys is pretty good! thats how you diversify your cast. give it a purpose or a meaning  but dont just plop black  gay  woman  etc. characters into your plot in an attempt to be woke. it actually does the opposite of its intended purpose.as a black man  I hate to be coddled to or given what I dont deserve out of sympathy. most african americans dont want overcompensation  they want to be treated normally. so if you do a film about russia  dont drop a black guy in there to show diversity  because why  there have been several times where character race swapping has been done with grace. idris elba as heimdall and samuel l. jackson as nick fury in the mcu for instance  but thats more because those people cantruly embody their characters. but changing race for the sake of appeasing pc culture is annoying af!in the same breath let s not act like there aren t racist ass lotr fans out there. but thats gonna happen  pieces of  will always exist. I dont wanna justify their hate. at the same time  sprinkling black people into this show gives nancy pelosI kneeling in african atire vibes
oh no. Im just now realising how unsafe I should feel watching spongebob squarepants!
last time I felt safe was when I saw the mutant from 300 on screen.
when people just read tolkien  none of this was an issue.  the book fandom was the literal definition of diversity.
I watch one of arch video and he was talking about amazon was buying views from brazil using food coupons but you only got it if you watch one episode  ring of power.
one thing that Im not a fan of when it comes to race and gender swapping is that a huge part of that character s personality and a lot of the plot ends up being about their race and or gender
what happened to actors and directors being able to take criticism  now its gotten to the point where they cant take it but gaslight you and shame you for not liking their project. its not my fault they decided to make a poorly made series with intentions and that be making an agenda than a good story   as I always say  if youre going to adapt something  get with the fucking program!
go act  in something better if you want me to watch it.  is all I can say to these    people   .
as long as you didn t change clothes at super speed in the phone booth or supply room  I d be cool with you as superman.  oh  thatscright  he wears it under his suit.
how does one bully someone into enjoying something  lol
one way to get people to watch would be to make a good show. not that hard
its insane how instead of complaining about how the writing sucks and how the characters aren t written in an interesting way they instead want to blame the fans for not liking a boring show with bland character which is based on one of the greatest works of literature which makes those fans feel like those apart of this horrible mess didn t care at all for that great literary work and did what they wanted to do screwing it up and wasting a billion dollars and the low viewing numbers seems to bare out that it didn t do nearly as good as they want to act like it did.
what we re looking at is an over-correction in the entertainment industry.
amazon are using their black cast members as human shields to deflect all criticism  when most criticism is about other issues  dialogue  pacing  faithfulness  characterisation .
dunno about superman  you d be a great wonder woman tho
nah.  its just as difficult  and expensive  to make a flop as it is to make a success.  with thatsaid  apparently  this was doomed from the start  if the gossip is true.  apparently  a lot of people turned this down because it looked like it would flop.  and  since the attacks on the fanbase started before the show ran its first commercial... yah  some producer looked at the half-done work and thought  this show is going to be hated  and worst of all  it will be forgotten the day after the final episode is released.  someone call the social media trolls  let them do the advertising so at least were not spending even more money to promote this pile of nothing .
I always appreciate your uploads. this not related to the video at hand but you might find this interesting  I saw something about emily blunt being done with the  woke agenda  in hollywood and the strong female lead is a boring roll.
its upsetting thatso many i.p s nowadays have been ruined or rewritten by people who were never fans of the i.p s or didn t care about them. star wars  marvel  dc  doctor who  star trek  disney  Lord of the rings  etc. its embarrassing. most of these i.p s have lost around half their audience more or less because  no one cares about forced diversity and messaging. they just want good stories and the characters to act like themselves
the war will never end...
I d watch you play superman.  .  just kidding.  I think you hit it on the head with the manufactured division.
amazon in brazil   youre racist if you- oh shit  these guys are actually black. new plan.  we ll  literally  pay  you  to  watch  it!!!
I treat  elves  dwarves  hobbits  orcs  evil Lords  and wizards equally
what most people dont realise is race swapping is ok if its done right. nick fury is the perfect example. samuel jackson did so well at the part that nobody cared. it also helps that nick fury wasn t a major character in the comics. but yeah  butchering the story is the big issue with this show in particular.
flip the script on them   when she calls muriel  regent   I get strong n word vibes
weird how they aren t attacking fans of the game of thrones prequel because thats actually good. these people know rings of powa is a turkey.
there are no more actors  just activists...
as a life long tolkien fan. Ive read all the books and appendices. I love the peter jackson films even though they had to take creative liberty due to the length of the books. they would have been about 10 hours a piece if they portrayed it word for word. on the other hand  ringworms of power didn t even try. its completely garbage from start to finish. its the equivalent of disney rebooting mickey mouse as tom from tom and jerry. its an all out insult to the true tolkien supporters. it makes my heart hurt.ps. melonie mac  marry me  just got introduced to your channel and I love your content. beautiful and based.
God I love you!!!! speak that truth I love it
I feel so victimized.
manufactured racism is a perfect term for this. they go out of their way to engineer a situation in which the things people will find fault with can be ascribed to racism  sexism  homophobia or what have you.instead of making choices that the audience will enjoy  they pigheadedly stick their unpopular decisions in identity-kevlar.
henry cavill as lara croft!
Im totally down for you playing super man
no one cared about the color of these people s skin. arondir was completely made up and they tried to write a beren and luthien type story out of him which fell flat  elf human romance is supposed to be very rare . the disa actress took shit because she kept talking about how she s the first female dwarf on screen ever when there are female dwarves in the hobbit. miriel is an actual character from the books who never has any real power  is forced to marry her cousin  and dies during the fall of numenor.
if human beings supposed to be thinking like them  how is it possible people are fans of chinese mainland and korean dramas       are they seeing themselves in a chinese drama   lol
this tells me one thing  there will no reboot of rop. the second season  if it even airs  will be more of the same  perhaps even doubling down on the message just out of spite.
mel mac as batman     sign me up!
I agree
Imiss the good ol days of pc pr pieces. this isn t even hiding the attack on the fans. so much for taking the high road. even back then they would admit a show might not be doing well or skirting around the issue  here they have no shame and are putting the blamed squarely on the fanbase they proclaim are intending to satisfy. jeez.
let s see. their going to make a new superman movie with melonie mac as the lead protagonist  I d watch it  I just wouldn t have any expectations that its a superman movie
losing 1 billion aint enough
did anyone go nuts when denzel was cast in much ado about nothing
I bet none of those actors identify with meteor man.
I had no interest in it to begin with  but since they have decided upon this tactic  they have effectively guaranteed that I will never even be curious about it
if amazon wants people to like rangz of power that badly  people do accept bribes. it would be a better use of all that advertising budget
melonie mac being bomb...makes me go boom....
I dont know why anyone is surprised by the gaslighting these narcissistic sociopath s do. Imean they are actors and I think for most of them that particular psychological problem is a job prerequisite. the actress playing disa did a better job than most in the show. but  her promotional appearances for the show were all I needed to know that no one involved cared at all about a good story or tolkien.
they hope they have normalized someone. lol  destroying the franchise and people s interest in it
its been 20yrs  so you should create and direct  crouching tiger  hidden white girl
I thought there was a lot of boring storylines I didn t care about and I thought they should ve kept closer to the lore too. the entire halbrand being sauron was extremely predictable and stupid. the only saving grace was they didn t totally go there and make galadriel and halbrand a thing which is what I feared going into the show. I dont think the show deserves as much hate as it gets though as overall I thought it was decent. I feel the people who hate it the most are the galadriel haters and the people who love it the most are the galadriel simps me being one of them. seriously I watched the entire show thinking why aren t these people bowing down and giving galadriel everything she wants. she s a Goddess.
peter jackson s movies will be the only adaptation of lotr I know. rop  what s that
you d be a great supergirl
I dont know where is this show going. but when people ask me about you . I always reply  melonie mac go boom.
if they d used tolkien s original non-white races  it wouldn t have been an issue. if they d adhered to the canon it wouldn t have been an issue. and if they d given us the real  southlanders  of middle-earth  it wouldn t have been an issue  Imean  a few oliphaunts could have come in handy against adar s forces. . instead  amazon apparently wiped out all of tolkien s non-white races  and made everyone white  except a few token darker skinned characters sprinkled here and there  even when it didn t make sense  which seems to have been most of the time  . and they call the fans racist.. anyway  tolkien s works exist. peter jackson s movies exist. and amazon s rings of power exists. and people are free to compare them with each as much as they want. one of them definitely does not go with the others. and that is something amazon s army of shills cant hide forever.
we need and albino superhero named bleach. his super power is jump scares
maybe melonie mac as supergirl might work....
wow. the amount of seething cope coming from these actors is something else. the level of self righteousness and narcissism is off the hook. they re in it for the audience and fans  they re in it for themselves. Im so glad no asians were in rop except for the one guy on the boat in the background  because I would hate to see anyone who shares my race attached to this garbage  makes us look bad. lol.
if you ever wanna get married ...  ... love how youre part of the resistance
like andor  its not really a starwars thing  obvious good folk  obvious bad folk  and lots of rubber masks.  its still a good show.  plus  its got a lot of that nice 70 s futuristic look
same. same.
my price is  10 000  after tax  per episode. the dark Lord bezos has plenty of       to toss around.
I ll take 10 000 dollars to be killed off painfully like the amount of time the plot of season 1 took
I heard on another channel that in brazil they were offering food coupons at the end of rings of pooper episodes to try and boost viewership.
@limegreenbunny  wouldn t be suprised for brazil
lmao
bahahaha
to be fair  I d actually watch you play superman...
people complain about galadrial except galadrial was a warrior in the books  think the fans of the books and the original movies are putting too much thought on their perception of her and the original franchise you also have to keep in mind the series does not work its way into the movies  it works its way into shadow of war and shadow of mordor the games  you also need to understand that no movie series is a accurate adaption to the books themselves. I think people are taking the series way too seriously  especially seeing as its a fantasy and has no real relation to anything historical.
if they didnt have double standards  they wouldn t have any.
I couldn t care less what color the actor s skin is  I just didn t feel moved by the story. when you take a story by one of the all-time greatest writers in human history and make a bunch of changes to make it more how you would have written it  dont cry when people dont find it as gripping as the original author.
nothing makes you want to watch their show more than attack the fans that would ve backed you if you were faithful to the source we would ve been by yer side but you had to do the opposite and went against the source and insult the fans ahd the author himself
you must love rings of power look at all these boxes we ve ticked   all the important ones   we just skipped out 4 story   meaning   continuity and entertainment  so our show is better than everything else on right now only bigots wont enjoy it.
its a bird no its a plane! no its super man! idk I think you would make a great super man so long as they go for equality and gender swap super girl along side the gender swapped super man xd it would be cool to let kara get to earth before superman and see how that universe is will she become super woman or a super karen.. who knows.
I would cast you as storm from the x-men. you would be from south africa  beast and ms. marvel would find you in
remember how no one batted an eye at djimon honsou s role in gladiator  that was because effort had been made to make a black guy s inclusion believable. modern hollywood could learn a thing or two.
thatso call pendulum is going the opposite way  idk what they are talking about.
I dont feel offended by this bullying because I haven t watched a single second of the show and I wont be. I will just not support such people. so  they can cry floods of tears  stamp their feet hard enough to cause an earthquake  and vomit out as many insults as they like  they have still done nothing to make me interested in their garbage.
bad analogy  having you play superman would tick a lot of the right boxes.
because unknown actors have such incredible influence on the general population s opinion right
I actually went and watched it. I dont know why everyone thinks its woke  it was pretty good when I watched it
I suppose folk like this never heard of catching flies with honey instead of vinegar.
sounds like the ghostbusters  answer the call situation all over again. where reviews on the movie weren t good and in response the cast and  producer of the movie responded to the bad reviews calling the reviewers and those who didn t like the movie as sexist bigots heck when they announced ghostbusters afterlife  the sequel to the originals   leslie jones called it a  trump thing to do  to not give her movie a sequel and have an all men one green lit  I dont think she knew that the 1984 movie existed and the one after hers was a sequel to those  she probably thought hers was the first ghostbusters movie to exist   but yeah  it had gotten to where anyone who expressed disappointment got the answer the call one was called a sexist bigot and was told thats why the didn t like the movie
as the saying goes  you catch more flies with honey than vinegar but that requires that you dont have anger problems  are mentally unstable or not able to take criticism.
has anyone talked to durin s actor   are all the cast interviews about this stuff
what if you were superman without even being a man   dont give them ideas  they already did it with batman
its like these people never went to high school.
I like this. great comment.
the producers knew  right away  there was no honey to be had from all this.  btw - I used to know a professional troll that  spent the whole day making new socail media accounts  talking trash  and leaving positive reviews  but mostly trash-talking  all day long.  he was payed by movie studios to review-bomb their own projects they knew weren t going to do very well under their own merit.

haha omg I forgot
fans never had any problems with minorities. do youremember games of thrones  Ive never seen any hate for actors who were poc women lgbt disabled plus size etc. they ve never promoted themselves as activists as well.
I fully support melonie as superman...superman go boom!!!
they want to rewritte lotr but they cant because of the simple fact that we allready got the epic prequel hobbit trilogy n the shadow of mordor games in which tells the story of celebrimbor n talion
I fully support the idea of mel in the role of superman.  all you have to say is that you identify as male and who would they be to question that   plus  you d look much better in the outfit.
let them run their mouths. it gives us a working list of actors work to avoid.
serious question. what is their reply when the criticism comes from people who are the same race as them  and still think it is not worth watching  as for their pendulum that is a bad analogy since you know a pendulum usually swings back and forth.
you just cant make these people  happy  no matter what you do...its almost like the mere fact that the main focus of angst and anger regarding this series  the absolute shitshow in the way they portray galadriel   is in-and-of-itself  racist  because it is ignoring the presence of all these other actors....are they angry because they are not the center of attention   of course if they were the center of attention for all the anger  it would still be considered  racist ....so no matter what the course  it will always be  racist .perpetual victimhood....
those woke manipulative actors are simply bad creatively
these people want to be known for their great struggle against  insert imaginary foe here   so their names can be held up with the likes of rosa parks  susan b. anthony  martin luther king jr.  dred scott  if they even know who he was   and harriet tubman  but they dont have anyone to fight against because all the struggling for equality was done and won before any of them were even born. they have equality. they have the same rights as anyone else  but they want to be victims  so they can struggle. they are narcissists  and nobody exemplifies their mindset better than rirI williams  who wanted her teacher to oppress her so thatshe could have someone to struggle against.
they aren t worth my time  best wishes mel.
we just need a non-binary steve buscemI to play every role  all the time now.
yes  but you d make a good lara croft.
the chef got our order wrong. thats it. we ordered s clubhouse  and they gave us stale bread with lettuce. a chef doesnt call you a racist bigot if they mess up your order.
no one is watching rop or even talking about itsince the last episode aired. amazing how fast this show fell out of relevance. must be sad for actors to hitch their career for five years to a terribly written show.
I dunno if you ve heard of nish kumar - he s a uk comedian  allegedly - but this has been his schtick for a very long time.   oh  you dont like me  do you   well  you must be a racist!
I ll be honest  I didn t like it.  I want accurate tolkien  I dont want the  message  in my tolkien entertainment.  just like I dont want chuck norris casted as blade  although twilight should have ended with blade showing up and smoking the lot of them.
keep up the great work
I have news for the woke people at amazon prime doing the rings of power show.  I grew up on television  and there are many  many shows that lasted one season or less  and it is because the public didn t want it.  this is normal motion picture business  and it is time for you to grow up.
where can I get my merit badge for fighting troll-fan-racism
now that the season is done and dusted falling back on  critical fans are racists!  just doesnt work anymore. we ve seen the bad writing  the cringe dialogue  the boring pacing  the completely unlikeable galadriel  and the horrendous shipping of galadriel and sauron as the reylo of the 2020s. just bury the show and forget it.
the Lord turns everything that evil can do in its attempts to corrupt creation into further and unfathomable opportunities to manifest his glory  and serve his will.  j.r.r. tolkien  a devout catholic  references this in the creation story at the beginning of the silmarillion  and in sharing his belief that this is a fundamental part of our reality  I find the irony of the role amazon is playing in this divine performance utterly hilarious!
I dont need to see myself on the screen  I got mirrors for that.  I watch movies for other interesting characters
if they want to do something similar to tolkien but not tolkien with different races  fine  why not do a show on the dark elves  maybe even on drizzt d urden the heroic dark elf from the book series. there could be a roles for a bunch of black actors  as long as they were true to the material and the actors were very dark skinned black people. this crap about you have to see someone like you to enjoy a show is bs  my ex was east indian and she was obsessed with peter jackson s tolkien movies and I liked her indian bollywood films.
the shadow that bred that can only mock  it cannot make - not real things of its own!
people becomes a fan of a particular ip because they love the story being told of that original ip. in the case of ring of power  there is an original written story. adapting an ip from written media into screenplay  it as is with little to no adjustments have always been the best way of honoring the author and giving somethings for fan to cherish.this  modern audience  spinoff is parasitic  unoriginal  total rip-off and fraud. it is sad frankly that the modern showrunners are multImillion  billion  and perhaps billionaire but are creatively bankrupt.
they could have added diversity in a smart way. the numenorians could be of all  human races  because the race of humans in tolkien was diverse. its sprinkling in a single black dwarf and a single black elf that people dont like  like wtf  how does that biologically work  pick a type of elf and make all of them black like the teleri. dont just throw some in here and there and pretend that wont change what the children look like. how do they all end up white 2000 years later in time for the Lord of the rings trilogy
misplaced diversity is the issue  not diversity itself. also diversity comes in many forms  not just race or gender  diversity of thought is important as well. where it is relevant thats fine  where it is not relevant it comes off as stupid.
when we will get black mulan
kanye was right.  candace owens was right.  kyre was exactly right.  the contributor to coindesk  isiah jackson  was also exactly right and forthright and the system fired him.
I could not care less about diversity in a movie  a good movie has strong characters and race should matter  only to keep to its origin story. it makes no sense that a columbian girl named rachel zegler is playing snow white  her whole name is about her skin being white as snow.
I never thought of race skin color back when blade came out
I also really like it when people defend this type of forced diversity in rings of power or witcher by claiming these are fantasy so why couldn t they look different but these studios force black people even into historical shows and movies.
ah variety. I wonder if they have found another round of investors by now....
Im sure that diversity would have saved the live action version of mulan. it only failed because mulan wasn t an indian woman and there weren t enough black and white citizen s represented in china.
fantasy settings should follow the rules of ancient settings... so areas are racially homogenous. this isn t a high school play where the black kid wants to play romeo  this is a billion dollar production. if you want to ignore the rules of reality and give every area the racial diversity of downtown new york  dont expect people to like it.
they easiest way to deflect legitimate criticism is to say that it is bigotry.
do you know what  I find miriel s figure hugging boob armour sexist. if you want to prove your feminist credentials by having a woman leading armies  why do you need to give her form-fitting armour which accentuates her breasts  exactly  thats not what armour is for.
so we cant critize the rings of power or the characters cause we can give our opinion  good to know thats why the show failed they attacked the fans and now no one is watching.
I would like to see you play super man  and on the color
they hate the source material yet use its name to boost their fan fiction crap
there s no better way to fight for diversity than plopping the diverse character into a work based on another country s history and culture  where the diverse character is scrubbed of any actual ties to their own unique history and culture except for the quality that gains those diversity points. skin deep representation at its finest  tokenism rebranded. but if you disagree youre racist  if you disagree and are not white you dont exist. all people of your insert diversity here sing their praises for the never asked for representation in european stories where insert diversity didn t exist. the world is diverse and must be represented in every piece of media  the world being specific american states  and the diversity mandate is only applicable to whiteness . so let s celebrate the fact that a supposed diverse society must be racist as hell if different ethnicities sho no signs of intermixing after centuries together. or one culture that dominates the rest by erasing all uniqueness from any people entering it. winnie the pooh would be proud.
are there any interviews when they say stupid crap like this where someone asks a followup question for them to explain house of the dragon s success
I dont know that website. maybe its far from reality.
jeff bozos really be embarrassing himself here
at this point  who actually cares about rings of power anymore
you in a superman suit  ummm eff yes!
actors still bullying tolkien fans into supporting amazon s Lord of the rings .where I come from we have an old saying that comes to mind and it goes like this ...fuck em!
hImelonie good afternoon.I absolutely  your outfit this afternoon for this video.may you  your family continue to have blessed life.takecare melonie
do these people have some kind of magical pendulum that doesnt swing back and forth
if you dont feel safe  you need a therapist.
why dont they bribe us fans with food like they do in brazil
if someone gives me a good reason to dislike them  I feel obligated to do so. thats not being prejudiced  thats tit-for-tat. stealing my stuff  bullying me  being a total a  hole  astard  those all qualify you for my contempt. and thats what they ve done here with lotr. I dont have to like you or put up with a lot of crap from you just because your skin is some particular color.
she is incredibly cutealthough Ive never seen her in the same room with shoe on head.
8 05 why not just make it a red armband.
8 00 I have an eruption coming on by hearing this    r.g.
amazon is desperate like disney releasing andor on free television.amazon ring is not Lord of the rings.disney star wars is not star wars.
you are a very funny girl
the more they act like this  the less inclined I am to watch their show. which is saying something  seeing as that inclination started at zero. its gotta be in the negative billions by now!
if Imay ask  for the next videos can you do a zoom on the page to be easier to read togheter.
stop lecturing us. just entertain us.
I want a badge!! I want one!!!
same here.  even if all the characters were snow white I d not watch it.   the plot makes no sense in relation to the books.
how narcissistic are these people
hey melonie and your cool dogs  so rings of power trying really hard to become interesting  to public eyes  haha good luck with that
they cant write a story and have no moral compass.
thatsoundtrack is banging girl who sang that who played that guccI band I love it
series was pretty bad. when the writers and showmakers cant possibly blame themselves  it must be because audience is horrible.  re-produce this in animated version with blue  green and purple characters and they will still get panned due to story writing being substandard which doesnt do justice to the tolkien works.
no  melonie we want you to be laura croft.
lol these people are next level dillusional
the reason why fixing rop is not an option because amazon is trying to destroy tolkien.
they are activists not actors.
that will earn them an emmie.when there is an emmie for antisocial behaviour.I have some hope that after the reward season is over they shut up for a year of two.@8 40 badges and plaques why is that this reminded my of plaques of cowdung
the color purple  holy hell you watching old films
sidney poitier didn t need all that.
racism goes both ways  if they think I should like the show simply cuz there are people of color in it  then that is racism as wellthe only thing this achieves is ensuring that I will never watch any project that these people are associated with  and I am a person of color
dont give them new ideas by telling them u would play superman...
amazon  tolken   token
oh there will be badges and plaques  they re not going to like what they have to say though.
how canthey say the fans are racist.  the videos Ive seen that are critical of the show are hosted by people that look like they are from the same race.
bullying fans is one of the reasons rop flopped and they have learned nothing  typical.
1965 star trek- diverse cast!!!!
I cant watch for an air bud remake with a chihuahua
awesome
rings of power stars have got to be the worst cast of any tv show I can remember  none of them are fans  actively talk about it being their show now  they dont like the fans  go on twitter to attack them and decry that everything is racist  if your show was good nobody would even say anything about racism at all  I personally love that almost 99  of the reviews I have watched have openly stated that disa  the black dwarf  was one of the better characters in the show  oh that damn racism is at it again.  truly shameful on the media for not calling them out and feeding the racism fire  we cant even praise the good actors because the only media attention they will get is the 10 people who say disgusting crap to them  never the nice shit  the world has become mean tweets
I have no clue who any of these  actors  are so..............
I love the show   I dont like everybody around it.
algorithym bump
bullying is the m.o. of narcissists and woke people.
bet you struggle finding representation for the name  melonie  spelling it like some kinda crazy person
they act like there has never been a black person in a movie before.
good vid siski
clearly that is the only cards they have to play  because they sure have nothing of quality to get an audience with.
I just wanna say I voted for obama twice .. I just didn t love rings of power  but omg if I could have voted for him  three times I would have.. I just think rings of power didn t have a great script.. but omg how about beyonc  and moonlight was totally robbed at the oscar s amiright .. also it didn t stick to the lore..  blm beyoncestunningandbrave
these people aren t  the first  to do anything.  old school star trek had one of the first black female characters and that was back in the 60s.  o hura even smooches kirk and that was a first too.  then star trek had the first black captain and that was way back in the 90s I think with deep space nine.  and he wasn t cow towing to any women on the show either.
its not a coincidence that paid actors are the ones doing this. we re at the point that anyone in hollywood is compromised and shouldn t he listened to. even our entertainment industry is finished and has its own agenda just like social media. as far as racism in these fantasy shows  if the original author came out to say something like  are there black people in my book  hell no  then the black community should and would have a problem with it. but if he said  yeah but they re not the ones Im talking about  then I can see having them in the movie. but this token thing is agenda bullsht brought to you by  the elite .
yep! no supe for you!
I love you. just saying...
superman no.  but damn you ll make a beautiful supergirl

people disliking woke race-swapping just shows we need to do more woke race-swapping.
@melonie mac go boom
I couldn t even watch  the show long enough to get to the part those people were in. such bad writing  and soooooo boooring. the reviews from folks like melonie were the only worthwhile part of the show.I was really hoping melonie would keep going on that conspiracy tangent  but her laughter about the self-righteousness made my day.
forreal
many comments feeds the algorithm      - the draugr
if the writing is terrible let s blame it on racism or seismic or any ism. how about writing a good story
it honestly baffles me how these racists dont see their own racism...  like  even the k 3 knew they were racists - they were proud of it  but this is a whole  nother wildebeest...
quoting mlk to the people claiming others are racist. we really have come full circle.
is this a cause of  yes people  syndrome  is it that the people around these actors curate what they see  they all loved you  you were awesome look here  the only people that didn t like you are racist  and they show the 0.01 racist troll comments    they cant be thst oblivious canthey
scripture of the day !
it is not racist to want to keep characters and their peoples to how they are described in the canon!
as long as amazon allows trop actors to shit on fans and as long as amazon shits on tolkien  I will never like this show. if anything  it only makes me dig in.
just eat some more butter mal.
modern day entertainment is really bad I cant bring myself to watch anything new I always fall asleep.
the actors and actresses can say what they like - doesnt make their garbage show better.......
the night of the living dead  from 1968 had a black male as lead!
not a little bit arrogant  aren t they.
if you gotta be mean to your audience who are giving genuine critics  you dont got good content.
can I have a medal or a plaque for putting a comment here
hahaaha
you will watch the new movie supertransman and like it or be called a somethingphobe!
I do think it is silly. but mostly  it is ignorant for these activist-actors actresses  etc.  to call out racist s or call upon use the term racism. we all know they work hard. and  ..... alot of these activists are the same folks that call out hardworking misogynistic brick layers  first responders and or service members. the amazon clubs  run with  the wheel of time  and  the rings of power  are not only boring  badly paced and poorly written directed  they are offensive to fans of the source material. decades of epicness. decades of loyal readers and fans in general from around the globe were lost instantly due to this incessant need for inclusion  and the obvious western wokeness and the money-seeking-money grabbers.  yikes. lett m push the narrative  right  -also  what s wrong with thinking a female elf with a pale complexion is attractive in a  fantasy  realm .. thanks for posting. keep on it!
this has been said before but imagine the backlash if the black panther was cast with a white actor.
they re using the ghostbusters 2016 model of advertising  any attention is good attention.  its just like your average class clown or school bully  being a sh!theel for a little attention
I did like a few episodes but not many. nice location footage. episodes 6 was probably the best. after that and like before  it got boring. the episodes were way too long. 45 minutes would have been better. the accents with some of the characters weren t the greatest. galadriel the warrior didn t work. I thought she was joan of arc on acid. the scene where she was hanging off the horse was laughable.
you play stupid games  you win stupid prizes - or  badges and plaques   I suppose...
these rings of powers creators sound more like zealots lol like by doing this the gates of valhalla will open for them. only history they re making is biggest show flop of a beloved franchise. amazon and disney competing on who cantwist ips and run them into the ground quicker.
ah   its just fantasy! you can believe in dragons and magic but you say black people are unrealistic! racist!  this is literally thier argument. you know what  yeah! I can believe that gandalf does magic  because he is actually an angel. I can believe there are dragons  because they were created by the dark Lord morgoth. so why do I have problems with a black miriel  because tolkien literally described her as  fairer than pearls and ivory . because her father is clearly white  and because the numenorian royal family were only allowed to marry their cousins and kin  not women from far flung regions of harad or or a southron which is what would have been necessary in universe for him to have a biracial daughter. I can believe in magic and dragons because tolkien set up those things  and provided them with a logical basis and consistent basis  in universe. the race swapped casting is neither logical nor consistent.
its not just the race-swipping its also making a gross plot and dumb story....so it will be superman turn into superwoman and she will be better than superman the moment she get her powers
this virtue signaling bs is ridiculous  it undermines the fact that people like denzel washington have been box office draws for years. Im a white dude  and I love me some denzel and can identify with him in his movies because he is good at his job
my mom was watching it yesterday and just from the 5 minute s I spent out there the acting itself was dry and not convincing at all came off like a preschool play heck even nbc has had low budget fantasy shows that are better than rop
ive heard there s a martin luther king film in the process... I hope I get the part of the lead role..gotta get the diversity in therehow stupid thatsounds..is how stupid some of these  actors  sound
Im going to make a movie about inuit nubians fighting aztec arabs for brutally oppressing their tibetan egyptian subjects. it will culminate in the epic siege of dongola.
oh  they re making history all right... its a historic flop!!
oh  now tolkien is a racist. good to know   means to take note but suddenly remembers zero hecks given
black hole of creativity....   shouldn t insult black holes comparing it to amazon.
the more they use these words  the less they actually have any real meaning
dont watch season 2 now. not 1 second of it. dont even watch it to review it. just track the ratings or lack thereof.
I would watch a melonie mac superman movie but only if its called superman not supergirl.
I got a just for men ad  just what kinda audience does you tube think you have amazon has lost billions this year and is laying off its staff  think you have bigger problems to worry about.
I watched the first episode and thought it was trash. didn t even finish watching it or have cared about it.
hateclick youtubers still making bs videos lol
im mixed race.  english  irish  dutch  norweigian  german. all of the aryan races.
if not looking amazon s  no  rings of  no  power makes me a bigot..... I guess Im a bigot.
bahaha
the woman who played the queen in this was fucking dreadful in arrow as amanda waller. itsays a lot they they hired cw cast offs and fucking lenny henry whose career died in 1998. no wonder will poulter noped out of there as soon as possible. I reckon he was given a script and quit on the spot.
man... they broke out the  reeeeaaaaallllly  good bottles of copium. its apparently patently impossible to make a bad movie show  so hey  all you collage art film students  now s the time to get a job.
I would like to ask them what their opinion is on a white person  playing the role as the black panther.
we fans are not racist  in fact we think all actors of the show suck equally
I ll happily be a bigot
I dont even care much that the series is unfaithful to the lore  and yhat they ruined beloved characters. the thing that annoys me it the fact that they act so high and mighty about a school play quality series and anyone who points this out is called racist or sexist... I dont care about your elf being black  I care that his character is poorly writen  is not engaging at all and fails to perform any basic human emotions on screen!
isn t it funny how these alleged racists like cobra kaI  top gun  maverick and the expanse which have diversity to spare
if the world if tolkien us so ferociously bigoted and racist  then what attracted the actors to this job in the first place
the show was terrible. whoever likes it and thinks thats good writing I pity them. you can like whatever you like but it hurts my heart that they cant see a difference
so its racist to ask why this actor  who was born and raised in puerto rico  felt the need to declare to the world that he thought it was his right to play a character from the folk tales of another culture
I despise the they have to look like me argument  look at batman and superman. you dont have to be white to be an orphan or an immigrant. you can see aspects of yourself in a freaking dog if you look hard enough!
rop is truly awful and so where the discount actors
9 25 america should be irrelevant in the relation to Lord of the rings. its a mythos for enland  not the uk  old england.
they wont cast caucasian asian indian mexican  descent actors for movies like mohammad alI  12 years a slave  marshall  42  moonlight   selma  and black panther  one my fav in the mcu 2nd too the iron man series as casting any actor other than from african descent  would make the story telling of the actual story real life true story  completely un-authentic and we viewers dont go crying why they dint put actors from different ancestry  but for fantasy films where fans wish they stay true to the characters created by the author  and they dont cast them  we fans become the racist viewers  if we protest or dont watch these un-authentic shows. huh  so this is what hollywood has come too  another politcal propaganda platform! lol! I really despise hollywood since 2015s and I aint even an american or from europe.
first time coming across the female nerdrotic and  I vomited into my mouth a little bit
lol  amazon is going to fail when they try to bully me into watching their crappy rip off of tolkien s work.I even subscribe to amazon prime  but I cant be bothered to watch that nonsense.
ffs  if people dont want to support the cringe of plunder they have the right not to do so without being guilt tripped with isms over it. these show creators clearly want to force diversity when its been proven enough times that doing so works against what they re trying to sell. down with gaslighting.
guess as a white boy I shouldn t have watched all those asian films in the 90 s
ok. by these actors thought process  we should be calling wakanda forever racist because their wasn t enough white  asian  and other races.
these actors got picked because of their skin color  what a victory against racism...
none forced.
Jesus
being called  racist  nowaday really doesnt mean anything.
the black people on the show feel like they re being discriminated against so they have the right to be upset
omg ... Im a racist misogynist l.... I better go and watch rop to solve that !
its not getting talked about so racism.  yeah  thats why.
muh racism
Im looking forward to amazon remaking roots with some redhead slaves for diversity  and a white actor playing kunta kinte.
im black and am not proud of this repreatation blah blah lol
much ado about nothing .... the story is a disaster.. a total train wreck.. bad written... that is the real problem of the show.
wow these people at amazon are delusional.  Imean seriously put googly eyes on a rock and write it well  I can relate to that rock..............just write a good story character.as a teen I once wrote a story about a doormat  it was a school asignment to write something creative .......... a fucking actuall physical doormat that went through an existential crisis about his purpose. talking to other doormats.  stemming from the abstract question would all doormats like to be stepped on if they could think for themselves  despite the purpose for which they where created   I got a really good grade for that the story would not have worked as well if the doormat was not an actuall doormat.
havent read the books but calling the tolkien fans racist is making yourself more unlikable
hey it isn t my fault if I keep falling asleep every time I try to watch your show! it means your show sucks and its boring. I never fell asleep on any lotr or hobbit movies! only the amazon series seem to hit me like a horse tranquilizer.  haha
cruz cordova has to be the worst actor ever.. I saw him on cabinet of curiosities.. really bad..
look  dont get me wrong  I know youre working out but youre nowhere near henry cavill    I would enjoy watching you over him  but just not as superman
when it becomes acceptable to race-swap black characters to white  I ll watch shows where race-swapping in the other direction happens. but not rop because thats the least of its problems.
are they nerds  saying racist shit  if the cast is getting racist shit thrown at them then complaining about is what  wrong
its strawman af to assume we dont like diverse characters. we dont give a shit about fucking skin color  we want good characters with depth.
I guess nobody mentions carnival row. decent newish fantasy story with a multicultural cast. the message is there but not in your face ugly. even has legolas oops orlando bloom in it.
I do have to correct you  one thing. a white person being racist is looked down on. but racism against whites is celebrated as somehow virtuous.
bad story writing. thats why I didnt like rings of power. not because of sex swaps  not because of race swaps  because bad story writing.
no  disrespecting tolkien is the biggest problem
I hate that guy s stone-faced acting. he s trying so hard to be like legolas  but he s more like black emo guy with only 1 range of emotion on his face.
@they call me mr plenty  and is it acceptable to do it
the cast isnt getting racist shit thrown at them
@artur okay  but   are you sure about that  because its not just them. its black mermaids  black casting of  game of thrones  shows  or the  star wars  universe. a lot of racist shit has been said. dont pretend this isn t happening.
@othellonga  the criticism isnt racist  if that is what you think then you have no clue what the criticism is
@artur  hey forget what I think. this is what moses ingram and john boyega will tell you. if y all would actually listen to them.
@othellonga  that is amazon demage control  it isnt racist
@othellonga  listen to them  listen to someone who is making stuff up and just coming to their own conclusions  noblack tolkien have the same criticism  are they being racist too  if an easterling would be race swapped by someone other than middle eastern the criticism would be the same
@othellonga  fans of tolkien that are black. not black tolkien
no  we dont like americanized cinema
right yeah  I agree. I was just speaking on the reverse because I was pointing out their woke narrative is false haha
first !
the irony coming from this video is astonishing. you call out racism but you called tenoch  peruvian or something . on namor video. glad I unsub. gurl.
1st
cynthia addai-robinson is the worst actor ever ... she ruined spartacus for me..awful actor
