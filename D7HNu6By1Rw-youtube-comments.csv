I put my faith in Jesus  not in people best advice ever. love it!
if you lose a friend by being honest with them  then that friendship s end wasn t a loss.
Im not a religious person but this was pretty eye-opening and made me respect you more for sticking to your beliefs.
its crazy to see the how positive the reaction to this video is. its a beautiful thing! thanks for sticking to your faith. God bless you!
love the video and I agree there s alot of corruption everywhere. Im catholic and it infuriates and pains me to think of all the cover ups in the church  it just gives the church a bad rep. thanks for speaking up mel  may God bless you!
best video Ive watched in a long time.  Ive always seen the woke ideology as a political agenda but you ve convinced me that it is much more than that.  its a religious movement that is anti-biblical.  thank you for putting this together and standing for the truth.
I am not a religious person. that being said  you make a good argument for it. I find your faith very uplifting
Im a bisexual femboy and to most thats a signifier that Im a woke ally but Im the furthest thing from it  Im quite religious and conservative  sure Im eccentric but my beliefs contradict everything wokeness stands for  wokery has caused me so much endless mental anguish  its like a thickening fog of despair giving me the inclination to just give up and die... these people are inhuman monsters and they have to be stopped!
thank you as a fellow Christian this was a really good reminder to stay in my Bible and pray more often to remain vigilant. its  hard to remember this when most of my friends aren t equally yoked and the majority of people in my town are woke agnostics. I also appreciate  how youre  able to put in clear words  every problem I have  with  the woke agenda. I enjoyed your videos before and will enjoy them more knowing this content is from someone who s spirit filled.
definitely my favourite video in a long  long time. Christian upbringing  and as someone commented below I too found it very uplifting. its refreshing to see your kind of critical thinking in 22 . I agree we all need to be having more conversations about values. religious or not
while I dont share your faith Im thankful to you for making this video. I reminds me there are some who worship but also have respect for those that dont share in the same faith.
this move towards evil and sin is happening right before our eyes just like the Bible says. Im glad youre helping others to see what s really going on in the world.
oh heck yes I am so glad youre exposing this! so grateful for all you do  melonie! thank you for standing on the front lines of the end times and shining a bright light to expose what satan is trying to do to our kids! God bless you richly  girl!
this was awesome  little sister! keep the faith  keep growing  and keep bringing this heat in Jesus  name!
the man should be the head of the household  but his wife is his most important advisor. she s also  as you said  his responsibility and thus his priority  meaning his decisions should be made with her best interests in mind rather than selfish and focused on himself.people really get focused on how they want to twist things to fit what they want it to be  but everything is designed to be a complimentary partnership.
I didn t realize I d be going to church tonight  but I dig it. preach it  sister!
I love how you are not afraid to share your beliefs especially in the world today. I also love how you can go on simpcast with women who dont share your views but you still treat them with respect. stay strong in your faith.
melanie  huge respect for this video. I honestly think this was your best one yet. please consider doing more talks like this.
pretty damn bold move  lady! Im proud to see you taking this position. you likely have already seen some blowback of some sort for it  but its important to get this out. so very glad I found your channel and subscribed! prayers!
I only recently started trying to educate myself on the subject of Christ. I started reading the Bible little by little  watching videos and shows on the subject of Jesus. I have a long way to go but im trying to get better doing away with sin and repenting and asking for forgiveness when if I do sin. I still dont know what every sin is so its hard not to sin but im trying to get better. I just started watching your videos and its nice to know I can watch and learn more about the Bible and Christ and watch some nice gaming content so thank you. the more I learn the more I know how much evil is in our society these days and its very concerning but I know God is in control. love and trust in him.
heavenly mike drop
no. thats how you know that friend was never real.
its because unlike so many people  she s not a coward that fears rocking the boat!
yeah I was just thinking that. of course it may be because most people who subscribe already agree with her  but still the amount of support is incredible
God bless you  thank you so much!
thank you so much!
you put my thoughts into perfect words. Im not religious and Im fully antI woke globalism  but I respect melonie s argument and faith as well!
as some who also isn t religious  I find this interesting. religion and faith give people a mean in life and a moral bedrock which to form. wokeism seems to devalue meaning in life and any moral value.
I cant say that I am either  there is a grudge I hold that is hard to get over. but growing up catholic baptist has taught me a certain set of values that others who have pushed religion back lack. Ive always wondered why its so hard to find the discussion of God and Jesus in all of this.  off the kirb ministries  made a video discussing how media does its best to silence those who speak of Jesus and God. its quite chilling and certainly an eye opener.ps  I ll be reading the Bible after I finish Lord of the rings. Ive heard Lord of the rings gets a lot of inspiration from the Bible. a good excuse for me to get  religious
@doo da  be wary of getting  religious  as religion can be abused for other things... like politics. however  if you can find the truth in the word no one cantake that way from you. there was a lot of truth in this video and as she said we all make mistakes so there s never any reason not to chase the truth as best as you can. Lord of the rings was something very special  and it disheartens me to see it being degraded as it is on amazon right now. many of the themes of Lord of the rings are inspired by the best parts of the Bible and those are the parts we should be paying the most attention to. love one another. gandalf knew this. gandalf knew many things.     https   www.youtube.com watch v rag_9j1zc2g
@doo da  please dont become religious. become spiritual instead. that what God s word is all about. religion is made to rule over man.
@elrodeus  wow  youre nuts.
@chris m  k
@elrodeus  Christ is wholesome and it makes sense an almighty God which doesnt see scale  depth or time would manifest vicariously as a finite carpenter to manifest his simple profundities. why part the sea s  when children can move mountains by faith. why perform acts of necromancy  when life is much harder to live and death offers mercy from life s demand for us to use our powers responsibly. the Christ is a figure of what we all should strive towards  devotion to that which is simple and true  devotion to that which is genuine and good. to prefer a cross to life s hedonism and meaninglessness. why do we father our posterity  why do we plant tree s whose shade we shall never know  because we donthe cross and thorned crown. Christ is the only way. he s the obvious way to anyone with wisdom. all else is hedonism. fanciful flight and meaninglessness. your life is finite  why not have a relationship to that which has already calculated your predestiny with subatomic scientific precision  why not worship the dreamer of all that has been dreamt  also  cs lewis is underrated. tolkien s kind of a ultra sperg normy. cool  but I dont know that I would enjoy his books.
there is nothing uplifting about being weak enough to believe in magic.
@reykcol of dunwell  my argument has been this. religion was once the mainstream and you had the regular followers like melonie who genuinely believe in it and respect its teachings and treat others with kindness. then you had the sheep who didn t truly believe or maybe they did but they took it too far and they never actually cared about others only scoring points for their God or church.for example in the past look at the religious zealots who took things too far and were willing to hurt others to further their goals and it was actively harming the church and its reputation of its normal followers. then when religion became less popular and communism etc started to become popular those sheep exchanged religion for communism etc and now they do the exact same thing but for their new religion.basically my theory is when we started to dumb down religion and fight against it the sheep of the religion who acted the way Imentioned above moved to communism socialism and wokeism. these groups also actively attack the group they were once part of and blame their horrible actions on the religion instead of themselves and their own terrible behaviour and hide under their new banner. I believe if things like communism didn t exist or at least if religion was still the mainstream ideology then the sheeple would have never left the religious side and the dogma cult would still exist. if anything them leaving religion has helped it because it got rid of a ton of the bad actors.must also clarify I am not saying religion is good or bad and I am personally gnostic so I am not trying to praise or recommend religion just stating what I think personally is happening. in society we will always have sheeple who act bad and with blame it on others whilst flying whatever banner they fly at the time. but when a new banner comes along the sheeple will dump it and blame all their bad behaviour on that instead and say their new banner is good and the truth.
@michael franz garcia  no  I dont love you.
@michael franz garcia  how dare I do exactly the same thing you do!
if it were actually  satanic   it wouldn t be so lame and boring. wokeness  is nothing but a secular version of fundamentalist Christianity  filled with the same screeching church ladies and conformist scolds of Christian culture from past decades.the only difference is that Christianity and other spiritual religions are no longer credible to most people in modern times  even to most who claim to practice them  so they created the even more dumb and lame secular religion of  wokeness   etc. to fill the void.
@dave the impaler  just follow the basic or ten commandment puff done or the most basic of all basic  consequence
@chief sitting feather  we z fake indigenous!!   thats the immaturity that is a hallmark of conservatism.
@chief sitting feather  we z fake indigenous!!   ok  karen.
hail Jesus
think about this for a second  you dont need to be religious for satanists to exist  in the same way you not believing in magic doesnt mean there aren t people out there who think they are witches. I am on the fence over the supernatural stuff but satanists  real satanists who do stuff you  only  see in movies actually exist.
@doo da  if you seek to become a Christian  I urge you to keep one important thing in mind  being a Christian does not mean that we get to decide who goes to hell and who does not  it also does not mean we should be judgmental. I have seen many  Christians  who are rigid  judgmental  and way too rule-oriented.....who lack the love and compassion we are commanded by Jesus to show one another. not all of us are like that  but we often get lumped in with those ones. keep Jesus and his teachings as your true north if you walk this path.
@melonie mac go boom   oh wow.. you prepared a whole powerpoint presentation on this ! yiaks  someone s been bookworming at the library.
@averagejoe87   very true.Christian means Christ first ! biblical texts second. not the other way around.
@melonie mac go boom  what would you do if you ever met your arch enemy  melonie mac goes poof  would you fight on sight
it was so overcast and gloomy but the sun   just came out  maybe this message will serve as a sign     blessed  epiphany
what a kind comment  thank you so much!  God bless you
ah thank you so much!
thank you so much  God bless you
@melonie mac go boom  this was a great video thank you .
@melonie mac go boom  God bless you more  melonie. youre one of my very favorite people creators to support
@melonie mac go boom  there s passage or a verse that no animal  birds  are not more important than humans.
@melonie mac go boom  hey great video! you should do a qa video about your Christian upbringing whenever. that ll be interesting.
@melonie mac go boom  if youre still looking for a more traditional church you ve mentioned this in an earlier vid  I suggest looking into an orthodox Christian church  particularly a greek one  the values and practices are very traditional and the priests dont cave in for this modern  woke ideology
@melonie mac go boom  great video melonie! you should check out a youtube channel called inspiringphilosophy by michael jones. he s one of the best Christian apologetics channels in this space. you could learn a lot from him. I know I have. he recently did a documentary covering evidence for the historical exodus called exodus rediscovered. its awesome.
satan doesnt exist.
satan does not exist.
@dragon ball fans cant read  the devil s greatest trick is making people believe he doesnt exist.
@butcher s blade  cant be tricked by something that doesnt exist.
@dragon ball fans cant read  looks like someone s been tricked
@highbudget  cant be tricked by something that doesnt exist.
@butcher s blade  I feel like his greatest trick was getting eve to bite the fruit to be fair. in all fairness its why anything sinful ever occurs anyways.
@highbudget  also repeating the same thing isn t helpful. at the same time what if I told you that your lack of belief in lokI was because as a trickster God he probably wants you to think he and odin dont exist. this does not prove or win any arguments it only insists that you are objectively the right one and thats arrogant.
@crypto-sabbatean frankist jacobinism  okay...

people are shocked that my wife and I have this dynamic. Imake sure her voice is heard and understood  but as the man of the house  Imake the final decisions. I also fully agree that a man s wife is his responsibility.....he is to care for her  provide for her  and most importantly  keep her protected and on a Godly path.
Ive been trying to explain this for many years now. makes no difference if a person is religious. we are all affected by this spiritual battle. God bless you! we need more like you in this world.
it is great to hear a God fearing woman speaking God s truth to the masses! keep up the great work! God will truly bless you in your life!
its nice to see someone so young with such strong faith.
melanie  this was profound! I actually paused the video a few times to copy down some of your thoughts. if I could reach through the internet to shake your hand  I would! thank you for not only having the courage to say what many of us are thinking  but backing it up with scripture. God bless.
love this. keep it up and dont feel pressured or embarrassed by your opponents. this takes actual courage in this day and age.
as a fellow Christian  I applaud you bringing Christianity into an industry thatshuns us. this is a absolutely fantastic video and the way you break it down is masterful. you are brave and you are inspiring. keep it up and ignore the demons.
thank you for this video. Im a fellow Christian and I see a lot of people not wanting to speak their mind and talk about the gospel for fear of cancel culture s wrath. Im guilty of this myself sometimes. but with everything going on Ive reached my breaking point. you ve inspired me to be more vocal. praying youreceive all the happiness you deserve.
as a person who has never been blessed with faith and struggled with it my entire life  religion aside its not really very difficult to be a moral person and follow these rules of the Bible.  to many people are weak minded and only care about instant gratification. wish there were more like minded women like you melonie in this world   bc it would be a much better place. thanks for this message   I hope it reaches the people that need it most.
hImelanie  Im glad I found this video. its given me a lot of food for thought. its what I needed to hear. God bless!
as Christian myself  keep up the fight! need more videos like this not only to show what is going on but also to spread the word of God. let your faith shine  God bless you hermana.
you give me hope that my daughters will wake up from the woke mentality one day. youre doing an awesome job! you have so much ahead of you.
thanks for this video.  as a reformed Christian Im used to hearing a lot of watered down Christianity.  very refreshing to hear a biblical response. your foundation is perfect. objectively true. keep up the faith.
melonie  thank you so much for this video! you did a great job. the Bible is full of truth  and life is so much better by following it!
I loved how you backed everything up with the word of God.  when all things fail around you  the Bible  is the rock that I choose to stand on. I am in firm agreement with you.    great video ! you were spot on.  as per usual
the idea of being woke has good intentions. people are being tricked thinking they are doing the right thing. knowing God is important now more than ever. Im glad you exist and ur awesome.
love it! standing strong and brave in truth. beautifully done. just know that you are not alone  there are many of us that are rising up. your message delivered with confidence and humility will inspire many more. God bless you!
I never thought of woke ideology as a religion until you brought it up but I absolutely agree and I bring it up to my woke friends quite frequently but they re oblivious for the most part.
this was so incredibly well done  melonie!  love it.
this was really well prepared. if I thought that woke family members would actually watch it  I d send it to them. thanks for articulating this so well. it has helped my own faith.
wow  thanks so much for this video melanie. finally someone who s like us is speaking the truth. you often hear this from the preachers standing in the pulpits  and even though they speak the truth. I feel they can never relate with the younger generation and get the msg across as someone like you could. this is something you are uniquely suited for as a side note  I was a atheist my entire life until I converted a few years ago  and I was one of those stuck up  Im gonna convert you atheists as well. one of the main reasons I changed my mind was because I started watching society and I noticed how things have derailed into total chaos and immorality since the mass population has turned against the Bible and its teaching. for instance the Bible teaches about having strong family bonds with a two parent household. woke ideology spreads the gospel of single mother households and tries to eliminate the father entirely. statistics show that 80 percent and women from single mother households end up in  abusive relationships  and have many different partners. 80 percent of men in single mother households end up with criminal records by the time they are 18. they also push sexual deviancy onto the mass public and we can see that they have started to push it onto children in the school systems and are trying to promote the idea that children are willing and adventurous when it comes to exploring sex   see popular shows like big mouth   I think the turn from Christian morals started in the 60s with the sexual revolution and since then things have spiraled downwards at a unbelievable rate. before then serial killers wasn t even a thing  and you can see how the rates of depression and suicide have skyrocketed since then. this is just the tip of the iceberg but a couple of notable examples. bless you for being courageous enough to speak the truth. Im saving this video as a reference to use in the future.
you should have instilled them with more values then.sorry but I doubt you did a good job with them if they are part of that cult.
when they re 40 and childless  or when they re 300 pounds and have 3 fatherless
@raximus3000  they were raised in a strong Christian conservative family. people have free will and will choose a path that is their own. if adam and eve can fall out of the very presence of God then you better believe your kids can. or are you better than God  and what do you think the prodigal son story was about even Jesus himself said that in the last days there would be children turning against parents. our children are not robots that we program and they obey. and why would Jesus require us to be willing to forsake our children  friends and even our own lives to follow him if we are guaranteed that our children will never leave Christ  our children would not be against us for following Christ if they didn t fall away.my sister went wild and turned on my parents but later came back to Christ and is now very close to them. she ll tell anyone thatshe messed up and they gave everything.you might want to know a person better before making a judgement on no info on what s happening.
@mickey mickey  it doesnt have to happen that way. Ive known many who have came out of the woke mindset in their late 20s to mid 30s. every human is unique and have to go through different things before waking up.
@shawn mccown  30s... when they re unlikely to have kids. youre clearly a beta if your big plan is to just sit around and hope for the best.
@mickey mickey  3 fatherless  what do you mean by that
@shawn mccown  you failed as a parent then.
@shawn mccown  dont listen to these other comments man!  if you did everything you could to raise them right they are bound to come back and see the light.  most people rebel from religion at some point and to some extent but if you are their for them  keep praying and loving and being that light dor them God will lead them back home. I had my own rebellious stage  while I didn t go full woke I did have friends who did and they eventually came back running. stay strong and keep praying!
@considerablysane  why  it is only natural for that to happen  dare I say cliche.
@riddik ulus  thanks man! I have faith. Ive seen them at their core and know they are a threat to satan s pans. they ll see one day that God has bigger things for them and come back with knowledge that can help others see the truth. they are amazing and very talented and have so much they could do for good. its just a matter of them seeing the contrast of the world and what Christ has for them.
@shawn mccown  if you wake up then youre woke. stay asleep and be welcoming to fascism.
they teach this stuff in schools now  its literally everywhere. so nowadays you just cant let your children be and grow by themselves  like you could before. you actively have to fight against the system if youreally wish to shield your kids from the woke ideology. and that takes a huge amount of effort.
@robovader  I agree. my kids are 16  18  20   23. thankfully  here in florida  desantis has pushed legislation through to limit the woke mindset. unfortunately  as our youth pastor pointed out  the culture has become so corrupt among students that if a student claims to be straight they are seen as an outcast. it used to be if a person was a virgin they were made fun of. now  its bisexuality that the new low standard among students. none of the schools my daughters have attended have had the materials that many in other states have had to deal with.
@shawn mccown  and all of your kids are woke
@seb ozz  he s Christian  of course all of his kids are woke. lol. you d think that would be some kind of a revelation to him.
@truthoverlies  so they are woke because he is Christian
@seb ozz  no and yes. the two oldest are   but  the two youngest are heavily influenced by their oldest sister. when I went through a divorce they were all living with me completely for the first 3 years. they looked up to their older sister as mini-mom. the oldest was going through that independent rebellious stage  like so many in their late teens go through. the divorce counseling material warned that its common for the kids to circle the wagons and start looking to each other over the parents. and it warned that they would try to play the parents against each other. which they ve done. basically  in my house there are moral rules based on the Bible like they were raised with. in addition to helping out at church outreaches to the poor and homeless and church ministry in general. they didn t like the rules and the wanted nothing to do with going to church. and their mother who turned her back on God has no Christian guidance in their home. so  when someone is wrestling with their sinful nature  they naturally like the atmosphere where they dont have to resist that and their mother s home  while conservative leaning  is not Christian. the two youngest keep in constant contact with the two oldest so their constantly being fed anti-Christian pro-woke ideas. this is something that none of them should have had to go through. and for the record  I never wanted the divorce. I knew how devastating it would be on them. it used to be the men going through midlife crisis and bailing on their wives but thats now flipped. the statics show that 70  of divorce is initiated by women. all marriages go through a trial and testing periods. even the strongest longest lasting marriages will admit to being pushed to the edge of divorce. but  in this culture  its ctrl-alt-delete when someone wants something new. especially  if one of the couple s own parents went through multiple divorces and affairs.its was the darkest period of my life after 17 years of marriage  not just because of loosing the woman that meant everything to me but because my kids had to go through something no child should have to struggle through. God carried me through it and I believe in time they will heal their roots will turn them in the right direction. at the end of it all I just want them and their mother and her husband to turn to Christ and make it to heaven. its all matters at the end of this life. everything else is temporary.
my daughter goes back and forth depending on the latest influence in her life  me and her are close but she has always been rebellious and never listens to me or her mother no matter how many times we are proven right.
@dean firnatine  it is tough watching them figure life out. the people we surround ourselves with impact how we think. so  she s getting your influence and then her friends and thats where the bouncing comes from. my sister ended up burning bridges until the only people still there for her was my parents. thats when she realized she was in the wrong and decided she needed to change her life.
@shawn mccown  read my other comment  send them to a deprogramming class before its too late  pay them money to do it if you must!
@j.m. obyx  what ! humans are not machines. you cant program or deprogram a person. they have to choose Christ with their own free will.
@j.m. obyx  antifa means antI fascism     and I dont support any narrative that trys to harm innocent people in the name if religion or consersativism...an that long ass rant about blindly following idealogies or political parties is pretty ironic coming from you
@dminon rulez  names can and do lie  adolf in german means  noble wolf   even though he had his good side  he was nowhere near a noble man.
@j.m. obyx  hitler had a good side
@j.m. obyx  guess this summarises this ladys audience well
@dminon rulez  yes. every human being does no matter how horrible. ashurbanipal religiously collected every clay tablet he could to add to his library  but he was the king of the neo-assyrian empire and as such committed genocide on the people they conquered on par with the nazis.adolf hitler was a vegetarian  an animal lover  banned human zoos  and initiated the 1st successful antI smoking campaign.andrew jackson  the founder of your precious democrats  was the man who won new orleans for the american revolution  and destroyed the federal reserve  two massive benefits for america which are overshadowed by his ordering the trail of tears by forcing the entire cherokee nation off their land  founded the democrats as a proslavery party  as well as the other horrid things.look at every good person and you will see even the most saintly and pure individuals have done something that was wrong. and most villains have their bright spots  not all wrongdoing is equal  clearly  but murdering someone for thinking they re a neonazI doesnt make you the opposite of the nazis  nor does it make you right  it just means you murdered someone in cold blood.glad the impaler stuck tens of thousands of people in giant wooden stakes in their anus and kept them there until they came out their mouths  but it doesnt change the fact that it was a psychological warfare tactic inflicted upon ottoman soldiers in order to convince an ottoman army  which outnumbered his own forces massively  to turn back  his motivation  he had to do everything he could to keep them from conquering his home  wallachia  and brutalizing his people.
@dminon rulez  oh  I already vehemently oppose an evil religion yours.
@j.m. obyx  whats my religion per say  describe it
@dminon rulez  thats the whole purpose of the video.
@j.m. obyx   didnt even watch it
@cout  Bible says not to judge. just saying.
@mrsushi1011  Im not Christian  I judge whoever I want.
its been called a cult for some time now.
they re a cult
people also say conservatives treat their politics as religion and honestly many of them do. anyone cantake something and basically worship it. rich people clearly believe capitalism is God no matter what they freaking claim.
its not.dont listen to this grifter.
almost anything can be made a religion. atheism and science are other strong religions  even if they presume to be anti-religious. where s fanatism  there s a religion.
@chandler burse  you are  wrong in both.
@one of zero  rich people basically run on capitalism its their God either way. at least money is. whether or not they say they have a real religion.
@one of zero  and do not tell me conservatives do not treat their politics as religious sometimes. people often mix Jesus with rightwing politics all the time. there was even an indian man who worshipped trump for some reason literally prayed to him. and people act like trump is the second coming of Christ sometimes. hell Ive seen people say that and say biden is the anti-Christ  which really doesnt make sense considering he hasn t made the world unite and convince the majority to like him which as far I know is what will happen with the anti-Christ
@chandler burse  the only reason itseems like they worship trump is because he gets so many bullshit accusations and insidious comments that they have to defend him all the time to the point itseems they worship him even if they dont. I am not even conservative and I thought trump was great for the role and I had to defend the bull said that many accused me of worshipping him when in fact I wouldn t even want to go for a coffee with the guy because although I think his much better that all those career politicians I dont even really like him that much as a person. of course in any faction  right  left or whatever will be the few insane fanatic believers but right wing at the moment in total is faaaaar less fanatic than the left. the conservative side has conceited sooo much ground in the last decades trying to be less extreme and more logical while the left does exactly the opposite going more and more insane to the point of putting little children with drag queens etc.the conservative side is also much more willing to debate and they are currently objecting to being silenced without demanding silencing the other side. they just want to have a voice to debate them and argue and shout their view while the left doesnt want anyone disagreeing with them having a voice.at this moment of time the left is faaar more fanatic and fascist than the conservative side.
@one of zero  I literally see people go on and on about trump without any insults. there s entire posts bragging about the dude. think whatever you want I see what I see.both sides can be obsessive and often are.
@one of zero  I see conservatives just ger angry in debates as liberals do.far right and left ones at least not sure about more centered
@one of zero  capitalism and money gives them power and influence though
@one of zero  Imean before copyright laws I think people were stealing others ideas all the damn time.
@one of zero  copyright laws are more capitalist I think since it helps with the objectivism which is considered an extreme capitalist belief that  one s happiness and success is above others  so patents that make one person rich and helps their interests seems in line with that.
@one of zero  competition is apart of the concept of capitalism but the capitalism most of the u.s. runs on is success and most money for oneself and eliminating competition mostly. Imean communism also was about sharing and giving the workers the rights to production but russia and china certainly dont do that I think.
continuing on with 1 corinthians 6 11   and such were some of you  but you were washed  but you were sanctified  but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the spirit of our God. through the grace of God and to the glory of God. thank you so much for your encouraging videos!
love this so much.  so proud of you for doing this
yessss girl! it takes balls to say these things nowadays. the devil certainly is whispering in peoples ears and manipulating almost everything  anything bad is good and anything good is now bad. its all upside down. God bless you girl
this was some of your best work. God bless  melonie
thank you  for this video! that took a lot of courage to say but also some of us need a little light shown in this dark world in order to find our way! thank you melonie for the light! God bless you
truly the Lord works in mysterious ways. I watched this and was near to tears with conviction. as one who has stumbled off the path of faith  the Lord  through you has brought me back. like others have stated here  your faith is inspiring. thank you for sharing the video and the links to the discord for prayer as well. God bless you and your channel.
just when I think you cant possibly get more awesome  boom! you top it!!mad respect for keeping it and never shying away from speaking truth or keeping the faith. God bless mel
great video! you absolutely nailed it. its so nice to see you stand in faith and speak truth!
thank you for sharing the gospel so eloquently and encouraging accountability!  praying for protection  provision  and discernment for you.
melonie  I just wanna say Im glad to be a subscriber to you. you and many others helped me grow closer to Christ and to go deeper in my faith and not be so lukewarm anymore. never change mel. God bless.
you know what  I just gained a whole lot more respect for you melonie. good on you.  keep up the good work.
I love how you started this video with ephesians 6 12  my favorite verse  melonie  that verse has become more true as time passes and it has strengthened my faith so much. great video!
bless you for this message. I hope you surround yourself with people who protect you from angry people seeking to do harm. keep it up mel.
God bless you man. very happy to see a follower of Jesus speak up about these things  especially a female believer speaking about these topics and how they pollute the gaming industry  corrupt the minds of kids and teens of modern society.  you are very much appreciated and im so glad to have found your channel    go in peace in Jesus name.
this has got to be one of melonie s best videos ever!  keep preaching the truth mel!
seriously homeschooling. you go girl! God bless you!
gotta say. took a lot of courage for you to do this  especially in today s culture
so well done  I will definitely reference this whenever I have these kinds of discussions with others! thank you for sharing the truth and being unashamed about it! God bless
great video melonie. its funny how a few of my friends or acquaintances have gotten shocked that Im not down with the woke ideology considering Im a black man. I just believe in common sense. glad to see you are doing the same .
I am religious and Ive had some pitfalls too  but I want to improve myself by changing some of my old and bad ways.great video  I am so sick of the woke ideology.
ovaries of steel

@truthoverlies  dont woke people say that people who are against their beliefs also seek to keep their own orders in power  keep systemic racism and sexism. are afraid to really question for the rights of others. and are often rich powerful people who care for nothing more than money and capitalism
right because it was ever right side up...  when was that
lol doesnt say much about a supposed omnipotent and omniscient God who lets the devil run around and have all this influence over people and just watches. its like a bad parent you just lets their obnoxious child get away with running around the store  knocking things over.
God doesnt exist.
@dragon ball fans cant read
I admire and applaud your courage melonie  and I believe this is your best work yet. far too few people are willing to put their beliefs on such open display  let alone defend them with such honest and straightforward conviction. great work! if we do not live and promote our faith...we are faithless.
this was a great video. we need more people like you. this is what Ive been saying for a long time.
Ive always known the things you pointed out  here. I saw this coming years ago.  thank you for breaking it down and posting a video about it. its very important that people know this.
its encouraging to see a young person spread the word of truth and grace.  great job young lady.
this is so thorough  well-thought-out  and well-presented!  thank you!  I have this video bookmarked now to share with people.  sadly  too many of the people I need to share this with are other  Christians .many people stumble over all this because it is often presented in terms of  good versus bad   when it is really about  perfection versus imperfection   but you hit right on that!  when people grow up always hearing a message of  good versus evil   and that message is found everywhere in literature and entertainment  not just in religious teachings   then people fall for the trap of thinking  I am a good person  so how can what I am doing be wrong and evil   my friend family member is a good person  so how could what they are doing be wrong or evil    but no amount of goodness is enough to justify our imperfection  and we are all imperfect.  an extension on this is that people think things are only  bad  because the Bible labels those things as  sin   so if one denies the God of the Bible  denies Christ  then one can do anything they please and its all okay!  but God declared certain actions  behaviors  and motivations as sinful because they bring harmful consequences  whether one believes in God or not  and this is constantly corroborated by earthly statistics.but the official religion of the left transitioned  inevitably  from humanism and atheism to relativism decades ago.  the same people who started out loudly declaring that Gods dont exist are now the ones preaching that we are all our own  Gods .  we are each the ultimate authority in everything  which is why feelings matter more than fact and people talk about their  own truths .  this is why you are not allowed to ever tell anyone on the left that they are wrong about anything  because we each get to make our own judgements about right and wrong . . . except  of course  that your judgements about what is right and what is wrong had better conform to the leftist s!  but the hypocrisy is inevitable!  when there is no set point of reference allowed  it becomes impossible to define anything  or establish any solid point of connection to anything else.  when everything is fluid  it is impossible to establish or hold to any set standards.
I been saying for years that modern movies are the new religious films. now  thanks to this video  I see God still talks to his children. God bless you.
as an atheist  I love watching someone with different ideas and ways of thinking. and bc of you Im really reconsidering religion  having a faith seems to be comforting and reassuring  itseems to give such a clear and obvious meaning to life. love your content btw !
I have seen some of your posts for the last couple of weeks. I always go through a few videos before subscribing. I am Christian  and this video was the cherry on top for me subscribing. I read my word every day. so this made me like your channel even more. keep up the great work  sister!
amen  sister mac. yes  ephesians 6 12-13 is my life verse. and helps overcome social media. thank you for this. continue to be blessed  protected and shine in the Christ.
melanie  big kudos to you.  I love your energy  knowledge   and restraint.
the guts this took video took to make legitimately blows me away. good for you! God bless. glad I found your channel recently.
so much respect for speaking on this. God bless you melonie!
love ya for posting this  mel! as a church going Christian you even brought up some stuff I haven t thought about in a while. wish churches wouldn t water down the word so much to be more  unoffensive  these days. thank you for making this video and having the courage to post it!
great presentation melonie. this is truly brave nowadays to express your Christian faith. I need to reevaluate my faith. thank you and merry Christmas.
I see the same thing  I agree with you melanie  stand firm in your faith  I believe in Jesus Christ  and only speak about this and I know people look at me like I am crazy  but people truly need to actually be woken up to what the devil is up to.
youre a real gem  melonie. you have a great head on your shoulders and a beautiful soul that you speak from. love you always! keep speaking truth!
I loved this!!!! yes!!! you are truly doing the Lord s work!!!! really was such a breath of fresh air! God is smiling at this. Jesus is Lord! amen!
wow  how has this video not blown up  you ve nailed it and explained it perfectly. hearing this from a young woman nowadays is modern dirty talk haha. keep preaching!
wow... melonie just got even more attractive. Im glad you pointed out all the commandments for husbands  from the Bible. the woke mob always focuses on what it commands of wives  but never how it is all to be reciprocated by the husband. we are all commanded to be servants to each other. you hit the nail on the head when you point out that woke culture is all about the  me .
thank you for this video  melonie. Ive been watching your vids lately  first time I watched one of your commentaries weeks ago I thought  hey her anti-wokeness is on point  like really well-based. is she a Christian   and then found out you were lol.may God bless you and help you continue to expose these lies that the enemy has fed us through culture and media. this encorages me to do the same  to preach the gospel and show people the truth.
thank you so much  God bless
thank you so much for having the heart to listen  bless you
you considering religion shows you have a conscience. that conscience is God s laws written upon our hearts.
thats amazing
yosemite an ideology cannot answer those sorts of problems. they usually create them more times than not. religion is just one more branch of ideology  and you ll deal with the same problems. I d consider believing in yourself before believing in a set of ideals. after all  it is not ideals that give meaning to human life  but human life that gives meaning to ideals. the vast majority often forget this crucial fact.
@cory v  yeah eventually it changes
@ninja07keaton  depends
dont seek religion. seek a personal relationship with Jesus. I promise you  the comfort he gives can get you through anything.
@ninja07keaton   the definition of  ideal  is  standard of perfection  a principle to be aimed at.  and then you go about espousing a principle like  believing in yourself  as a standard thatshould be aimed at. on top of all of that  you then espouse something like a  fact . if facts are not a perfect representation of reality  then youre tacitly admitting your fact could be flawed in which case you merely believe its true subjectively.and if thats the case I have no good reason to believe you based upon your subjective interpretation of reality.
God is leading you   he loves you more than you can begin to imagine.  youre one of his creations   created with a purpose.
@dark 5cythe  the latter is more important than the former  but you can have both. and it can be successfully argued you can not have one without the other. how  because the term  religion  is very broad. also  it could be the case that there is one true church  or it could be the case that no church is the true church. either way  if either statement is correct the value of finding that out is worth the pursuit.
@dude guy  humans being the ones who give meaning to ideals is a fact. you can no more refute this than the existence of the earth. believing in yourself isn t a standard  its a point of skepticism. there s no evidence to suggest we dont exist  and so we live accordingly. true enough  ideal is a  standard of perfection   and perfection is easily the worst fiction humanity has ever conceptualized.
@ninja07keaton   humans being the ones who give meaning to ideals is a fact.  false. how  because thatstatement is universal  and therefore self refuting. if there is such a thing as universal meaning then its impossible for humans to give something that has meaning outside of humans. so  wrong again. you can no more refute this than the existence of the earth.  false.refutations are based upon belief of a mind to accept an idea as true. it does not actually have to adhere to reality. so  wrong again. believing in yourself isn t a standard  wrong.standard is defined as  a level of quality or attainment.  in order to  attain  the quality of believing in yourself you must achieve the standard that is measured in a mindset.so wrong again. there s no evidence to suggest we dont exist  wrong again.evidence is not objective. thatstatement implies evidence is objective. its not.objective evidence is defined as evidence that we base on provable facts. provable facts are based upon proofs.proof is the evidence that compels a mind to accept something is true or valid. it could be false. and perfection is easily the worst fiction humanity has ever conceptualized. again. you dont see the problem with your contradictory statements.learn to stop contradicting yourself.either something is  true  or it isn t.if its true then its perfect.perfect is defined as  having all the required or desirable elements  qualities  or characteristics  as good as it is possible to be. true would have all the required or desired elements  those elements would be indicators that would denote a perfect representation of actuality  of reality.so  wrong again.and if your facts are not perfect  then they are flawed.  if they are flawed  then you dont get to use the word  fact  as anything more than your flawed subjective interpretation of reality. which means I dont have any good reason to accept anything you say.and neither should anyone else.
@ninja07keaton  what I find funny is someone who appears to be a skeptic  constantly appealing to universals.
@ninja07keaton   how  because thatstatement is universal  and therefore self refuting. Im 99  positive this will go right over your head.oh well.
psychologically it is amazingly beneficial. Christianity orients the perpspective to  my life is intrinsically meaningful  I can access higher states of consciousness to overcome obstacles  I am cared for  I have the capacity to do good  I am important  I am seen and loved. I could go on. Christianity pushes people to positivite action  self-love  and a bunch of societally good things like kindness and patience. its pretty tits imo.
I also used to be an atheist. then one day God revealed himself to me and I began to learn about the errors of my atheistic thinking. I pray that Jesus will also reveal himself to you. if you ask with an open heart then I know he will. God  bless you yosemite.
former atheist. Im slightly different. walked away from atheism through a long train of thought focused on logic and reasoning   the origin supposed eternity of the universe or possible multiverse  things affected or unaffected by time  space and matter  what may or may not be out there in the supposedly infinite cosmos  etc. . the longer I would thoroughly think everything through  the less logical atheism has become.
you should definitely consider joining the family of God because thats what we are is a family.Jesus apostles came to him and said  your mother and brothers are here to see you andJesus replies   who is my mother  and who are my brothers   he points to the disciples and says   here are my mother and my brothers. for whoever does the will of my father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother. being a part of the family of God gives us a kinship that is stronger then any blood ties. it would be awesome to see you become a sister in Christ. I was also a atheist for many years but converted after seeing how evil society had become after turning away from God and the teachings of the Bible.
@dave and his death beanie same here. I was a atheist my entire life but converted after years of study and watching the degradation of society after turning from God en mass
@daveandhisdeathbeanie atheism is a religion lmao  trust me I was in the same position you were. I know atheism is a religion cause I ran in those circles.
@melonie mac go boom   I am the antiChristits what I was meant to beyour God left me behindand set my soul to be free   slayer - antiChrist
@dragonballfanscantread2383  thanks for your reply I can only guess youre 14 from your response  give it a few more years and you ll realize people treat it like a religion with the way they zealously defend it.
@dragonballfanscantread2383  if its logical and reasonable there is no need to defend it  it would defend itself. its an ideology that people cling to.
@dragonballfanscantread2383  you described being an agnostic not an atheist. an atheist  believes there is no God  or Gods. which requires belief or faith.
I encourage you to earnestly seek God  with a humble heart. the gospel of john is in my opinion the best place to start  then read mark or matthew. any of us are happy to answer any questions you have  we will pray for you as well. God bless you.
God will forgive you for being an atheist  just accept him into your heart
they ve done this because the wickedness of wokeness has forced them to become inoffensive  according to satan s plan.
and see all I hear from the church is what husbands have to do and never about what wives have to do  its always about how husbands be better and wives you do you ..now yes husbands need to be held accountable but we also have to hold wives accountable too which itseems every church I have been to in my life had a hard time doing. I knock both genders cause both need to be held accountable and will call out double standards as I see them.
@the_smoking_patriot  the Bible literally says wives to honor their husbands and submit to them. it often says wives to do the same as husbands.and Ive never seen the Bible say not to hold wives accountable. whatever church you go to is kind of saying weird things.
@the_smoking_patriot  my church held a woman accountable for cheating on her husband.
@the_smoking_patriot  I think making demands for women to be the traditional type of woman is gonna help us really. everyone s so different even in religion. Im so sick of people wanting everyone to be a carbon copy. its funny that melonie and her fans talk about this being an issue of wokeism yet so many seem to demand women to be supermodel sexy  boring as hell by the way why do people even like fake looking models   and not grow old based on their response to the dead space remake. maybe I am just being too consumed by my own bias and irritating let alone my own doubts. I pray  I read  I sin  I feel guilt  but every day now I still look at the world and feel that its entirely possible I am wrong. and maybe thats all we can be. not to think we are 100  but have faith and thats it.
@chandler burse  this was years ago  left that church and the church after one too cause I started to see this woke stuff. suffice to say my eyes started to open about stuff several years ago and have continued to get wider over the years
@chandler burse  I agree on women going back to being traditional in a sense would go a long way in helping us. I dont think every man wants a supermodel sexy woman  I believe every man wants a healthy woman. like ya if she were fit great but just dont be obese  not that hard .and yea I canthe same about men but this is about women since its easier to men accountable on weight than it is women. but if a woman is healthy weight wise then I would argue 90  of men would be happy with that. people wanna hate on the Bible but guess what  it works if you put it into practice. I got a friend who was a feminist  she woke up and studied how to be Godly feminine woman .she is now married and happier than she has ever been in her life.
@the_smoking_patriot  I literally did not even agree with the idea that we should demand women to go back to being traditional. I do not know how youread my comment and got that idea.
I really appreciate your boldness to be so forthcoming about Jesus. its very important now more than ever to really be like Christ in this way--to show love and compassion without compromising truth. thats really what Jesus was teaching.
thank you melonie for this reminder. Ive been a Christian for years but still struggle with things in my life. youre absolutely right in saying we need to be in constant prayer and in the word and at times thats were I fail. I have no one to blame but myself but I am grateful for brothers and sisters in Christ that remind me that Christ is here with us and he will help us to overcome and give us that conviction. I absolutely hate when I sin and feel instant regret but God s grace and mercy is beautiful and I need him more. please pray for me that I will live for Jesus more and die to myself and pray that Imay become more fruitful in my life. john 15 18 reminds us that those that hate us hated Jesus first and that we need to continue to pray and show them love. thank you for your boldness and courage in the Lord. we need more people like you sharing the gospel that isn t watered down. just want to leave you with encouragementmatthew 5 10-12 esv   119 helpful votes helpful not helpful blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness  sake  for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.  blessed are you when others revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account. rejoice and be glad  for your reward is great in heaven  for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you. mel keep living for Jesus and I pray that he continues to bless you in your life. a struggling brother in Christ  ...thank you!!
this had to be said. kudos to you melonie and I hope you get over 1 million views on this video. facts like these cannot be argued with by the authoritarian left or assholes like vaush and destiny. these are facts for ascension period. I had a spiritual experience while watching this and shared it with my elderly mother who also enjoyed it. you have my gratitude.
I love your channel. thank you for having the courage to say all of this.
that was amazing. wish I had heard a sermon as succinct and clear as that when I was younger! thatsaid...brace for impact  the hate train is coming
it makes me happy to see a woman of faith  and not only that but with good understanding of the gospel.
powerful message.  bless you for the strength to put it out there.
love to hear your thoughts on the thought movements of the day. I have come to the same conclusion as well and loved the detailed presentation. keep up the good work!
great job  Im very impressed! u explained the gospel perfectly! u will definitely reach some people with this video. keep up the good work!
mel  Ive been watching your youtube videos for about 12 years now.  I love hearing you talk about your faith within Christianity.  youre amazin!
this is awesome sister.  thank you for preaching the truth and being a woman who is actually taking a stand for the word of God in a world where too many men are afraid to speak up and cower in the shadows.continue being a light in the world and a city on a hill.   give your entire life  and he will use you for good.   thank you for your obedience and courage.
hey thanks for putting this video out. I needed this. I need to read my Bible more and study more to build my spirit up to face the spiritual warfare thats going on nowadays. I pray that Jesus will bless you for spreading his message.
I subscribed to your channel for your dc marvel comic related material. let me tell you  this video and you being true to scripture just made this one of my favorite channels even moreso. thank you!
thank you! thank you! its the best video Ive seen in a while. thank you for stating the truth. yes  you are right  its hard to be in a contradiction to this world s rules  but we have to stand with our Lord. be brave  melonie and keep your beautiful work going! God bless you and your family!
amen melonie mac and thank you! always enjoy your videos  but this one is by far one of the best ones yet! would love to hear your testimony someday. ps  I absolutely adore the way you speak
this video liked and favorited. thank you for telling the gospel. you did a wonderful job doing so. hI  and blessings to you.
honestly comforting to hear someone say it. its getting weirder out there every daycrazy cuz I was just getting back into my Bible and having an extremely similar conversation with my mom a week ago.
melonie mac   I really like this video that you have put out here   all I can say   just wonderful the presentation of how you have presented the scriptures of the Bible   and match with the crazy events of our present age that we are living in   melonie  once again very well done
I have been struggling in spirit lately  but I thank you for putting this out there  I have seen your videos before and I am not ashamed to say that I had you all wrong  my assumptions were off but Im glad sister  you have uplifted my spirit  thank you so much  please continue your journey and God be with you.
really liked the explanation of how sin is a byproduct of free will. I was raised in a cult that took a very literal view of scripture  so I never had heard that before. I just started trying to unlearn all the heretical teachings recently.
@the_smoking_patriot  the Bible works for some  some felt happier without Christianity. everyone works differently deny it if you want I guess. but Ive seen so many stories of people who are happy with beliefs  happy without. happier when they switched. it doesnt matter.
@chandler burse  Im talking from a Christian perspective  obviously other perspectives can work too. if you truly make it work then hey more power to you.
@chandler burse  oh I agree there are shallow men though I would argue there are far more shallow women today. personally the men I have known in my life haven t had those physical preferences more so values that line up with their own. now I have known lots of women who have such strict physical standards for men that it boggles the mind. Imean to each their own  but you gotta be realistic at the same time. I dont care about chest size or stuff like that  just a woman who is healthy enough physically.
@dragon ball fans cant read  and yet you watched itstill
@the_smoking_patriot  I didn t.
praying for you  thank you so much for your comment
@melonie mac go boom   well  I dont want no Jesus freak to tell me what its all aboutno black magician telling me to cast my soul outdont believe in violence  I dont even believe in peaceIve opened the door  now my mind s been released   black sabbath - under the sun
this really means a lot  thank you! and I just know people are gonna come for me because of this video  but bring it on! I feel God put it ony heart to make it and I was obedient  even though it was really overwhelming to prepare and record
the hate train will derail!
no one will care enough to bring the hate imo
@melonie mac go boom   the beauty in twisted darknessr   d by the light of Christwe were not born to followwe dont need your guiding light   at the gates - r by the light of Christ
@dragon ball fans cant read  thats weird  because it kinda sounds like you do
@dragon ball fans cant read  are you depressed
I agree many men are too afraid to speak up but at the same time if they did would be supported on the same level or would they be chastised even harsher  its easy to say  men speak up  but when they do who supports them
there are so many people who scream because of their religion today I have no idea what men you are referring to unless you think men who dont go onto the streets and harass people with their poorly put together sermons are the cowards lol.
@chandler burse  I was referring to men I have known that would start to speak up about stuff like in the video here and it was women who shut them down  yet women say men need to speak up ..so which is it    if they want men to speak up then shut up and let us speak
@the_smoking_patriot  just speak up and dont concern yourself with the other problems. maybe this is the issue  humans are so petty and pathetic we cant just do things to try and help we get so hung up on others issues we have to start placing blame all the time. I do too I guess.
really weird.  can only go two ways  we shall see... stay strong people
stay away from the lies of the Bible.
@dragon ball fans cant read  I know  that was the point  all kidding aside  I just want to see the best for you and anyone else for that matter.  Ive studied the occult  freemasonry and the Bible  please keep an open mind heart and read scripture or an interpretation of Christ s teachings.  this world is a deception and I certainly dont have all the answers but my faith fills in much of the gaps in this ever increasingly crazy and unstable world.  much love to you......
awesome melanie. you put some good work into this! thank you
thank you melonie for having the ba  s to do your video on this. as someone who would understand that you mmgb are not taking a role of pastor or leader  but a sane person sharing simple truth. the enemy has done a great job of glorifying satan and demons as silly actors on the world stage instead of knowing this is the plan to decieve.amen. you are blessed. posting the gospel of grace in your words was so awesome.
I started reading my Bible for the first time recently. Im on like day 90 of 365 going through the entire Bible and I am learning so much. also another verse that I recently read as another point to what you are saying regarding woke culture  deuteronomy 22 5  at least the way I interpreted it  I could be wrong.
Ive never been happier than I am now with a supportive wife and baby boy.
wow! I thought this was more of a gaming channel. I wasn t expecting this. that was amazing! you ve earned another subscriber.
subscribed   its refreshing to see this on youtube!  you explained things on point. keep up the great work!
spot on in every regard. wonderfully done  sister! people are quick to forget that the Bible doesnt say satan is a powerful warrior or the boogie-man hiding under your bed. itsays he is a deceiver and the father of lies. of course he comes at us sideways by presenting us with evil disguised as  goodness   rather than head-on with obvious evil.
I applaud you on this video. I have followed a lot of channels thatspeak of antI weakness but all of them fail to get the core of the problem. you are very astute and brave to post this because it is not very well received. I have become a fan of yours. a lot of what they talk in hollywood were teachings by crowley  although I know they re way more successful occultist that creep in the shadows.
thank you so much for this video! if enough of us shouted this message as freely as you did here  this woke nonsense would dry up and blow away. the world would be a better place. I always believed that would happen eventually  but hearing your video today served as a welcome reminder. bless you.
ms. melonie  you make a very good argument. I never thought to look at this whole situation like that before  but it does make sense  especially with the specific verses you used throughout your presentation. thank you for sharing  and it was a very enlightening experience.
this video is amazing! thank you melonie for always bringing the thunder!!
when people reject the religion and its guidance we get the society we re facing today.btw you made me subscribe your channel. I wish to watch more of such knowledgeable videos.
amen sister. thank you for your courage! what a great example- faith over fear of being cancelled  ridiculed  etc. stay vigilant!
what a well made video. most of the time I cringe and am embarrassed when youtubers talk about Christianity because its so un-Christian. but you! you shared the good news with maturity and grace.
we need more people like you in this world melonie. you aren t afraid to say the truth   I respect you for that. I have gained a whole new level of respect for you.
awesome video! keep preaching the word and stand strong! you just got another subscriber.
you ve touched hearts with this video. from the bottom of my own  thank you for sharing.
really impressed by your well thought out presentation. you have a really grounded understanding and usage of scripture.
been catching your videos here and there  mainly gaming pop culture vids   I used to be a huge tomb raider fan and I think I found you hating on the new lara and I felt it was a breath of fresh air. was not expecting this kind of video from you but this too  was another breath of fresh air. well played  melonie. respect for real.
you are right on with your assessments on the woke.  keep doing the good work of testimony!     d
amen! and bless you  that is amazing that you are committed to God s word
youread that book thats full of tons of inconsistencies here s a funny one seeing God   I have seen God face to face  and my life is preserved.    genesis 32 30 no man hath seen God at any time    john 1 18
@dragon ball fans cant read  its only inconsistent if you pick and choose what you want to make your point. if you take the whole verse in context.. jacob wrestled with a man that night  a man who was not given a name  and is  from some theologians  considered to be Jesus making a human appearance. it is not specified  only implied. original hebrew.jacob was convinced he wrestled face to face with God.the verse that you speak of in john  is based upon the understanding that to see God himself face to face  not the son  not the holy spirit  but the father.. is true  and is not contradicted anywhere.
@rob d  nah  its pretty inconsistent.
@jos  villanueva  marxism  socialism and communism aren t religions.atheism has no doctrine.not a single atheist claims anything because the burden of proof is simply on the religious.an atheist simply believes there is a lack of evidence to suggest believing in a God s .why do you think you know the answers because a book that isn t even older than buddhism said so
bless
amen sister  didn t know I was getting a sermon today but this is a sign from God thatsomething is about to happen.
thank you so much for putting in the time and research to bring to light the sins of our society. many people say the Bible doesnt relate to the modern world  this helps disprove that. God bless you.
exactly the same conclusion I have come to. thank you for this video and for standing up
love this video mel. love your courage as well.
thank you for all you do melonie. God bless
this was very bold  that alone earns respect.  you said the kind of things Im usually afraid to say  honestly I didn t think a video like this could actually be done but here it is.  and most of the comments have been encouraging  I actually expected the opposite  this is really amazing.  I keep thinking we lost the struggle when it comes to the media  with thats being put out there  but yeah this is great  God uses everyone to do amazing things and that very much includes youtubers.I agreed with everything you said  as a believer Im just thrilled this video was made  keep it up!!!
so proud of you for coming out with this its an important message and I hope it gets the recognition it deservesIm wondering if its still ok if I were not to date or get married or have children when I get older is thatstill fine or do I have to  Im a Christian too and I still wonder
awesome work melonie. thank you for being you.
it takes courage to post videos like this  particularly on youtube  but Im glad that you did.
wonderful video! glad more and more youtubers are bringing attention to this demonic nonsense and what it really is.
incredible video  you spoke the truth sister. and it wasn t with hate it was done with tough love. Lord Jesus is the truth the way and the life.
thank you for your boldness and clarity with scripture. it encouraged me to stay in the word more.
greetings from brazil melonie!how good is to see that there are people who share the same worldview and faith even far away. keep rocking girl!good work and God bless!!
this is such breathe taking   awesome presentation. great analogies.
Ive never been religious  and thought the idea of satan worship laughable  but in the last year Ive started to see that this stuff is actually real and deeply fuckin sinister. keep up the good work soldier!
blessings to you and your channel! im a pastor and appreciate your willingness to defend the faith! glad I subscribed to your channel
great video. truth spoken from the word of our Lord.  its sad to see wokeness even in some Christian circles now  we need to stand strong in our faith upon the rock that is Jesus Christ
phenomenal. praying for protection from the attacks of the enemy. this took a lot of courage.
I really appreciate you making this video tbh because Ive noticed a lot of these things myself and find it difficult to put into words. I think its important that we talk about this stuff and make it clear that its not from a judgmental standpoint but a caring one  like you ve done . Im glad you brought up the onlyfans thing. I worry about young women being encouraged to do stuff like that because its seen as  sexually liberating  and people often say  they are just making money  who cares  while completely ignoring the risks of that work and the long term mental effects. many young women probably dont realize it at the time and thats why I hate thats its seen as not a big deal or even encouraged. we are living in a time where absolute tolerance and validation is seen as love  but thats really not the case. and often times speaking on it makes people feel that you are trying to take something from them or control their life when in actuality  I would just like to lead by example and share my opinion on these things without backing down from it as society pressures you to do.
thank you so much melonie for posting this  I work in public education so I especially have to be around this ideology  so I am blocking off a lot of energy on a daily basis.
also can you send prayers out to me and those around me  there are many I see affected by this and I hope things get better for all of us
that is not a sin  paul did that very thing and stayed single and celibate
@melonie mac go boom   upon these vile remains of ChristI hold the lance that pierced the foolhis true meaning withheld in a shroud of liesrecite nine times the antique rite   arghoslent - defile the angelic
as long as you dont have sex outside marriage youre fine. its not a must to marry but its favourable by God.
thank you so much  bless you
this video needed to be made. keep up the good work.
I definitely understand your point. I think people get tripped up by the use of the word satanic. but many people are substituting their spiritual emptiness with celebrity worship among other things. science can be a religion for people too... the  trust the science  crowd that follow blindly.
wow you had a powerpoint presentation prepared  great work! starts off strong too  the state of the world has been wearing on me a lot recently and ephesians 6 12 really resonated with me.
never underestimate the cleverness of satan. he knew how to tempt Christ  so he knows how to tempt us. do more Christian-themed videos  mel!
youre absolutely right and thank you for having the balls to say it.
its refreshing to see you acknowledge this! there are no shortages of wolves in sheep s clothing these days.
amen!! a lot of good points and love how you back it up with the Bible! great video!!
just found your channel.  Im praying I can find a good woman like you.  keep fighting the good fight.  you are making a difference.
glad you did this video  together with various Bible verses. and  youre right about the very self-centered  and self serving nature of the  woke ideology movement religion.  it goes against the natural order  as well as natural traditional marriage and family. anyway  thanks   God bless!
amen  girl... preach that word!!!
agreed  and very well done melonie!we can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark  the real tragedy of life is when people are afraid of the light!
this was actually comforting to listen to for some reason. Im not even particularly religious. lol
I enjoyed the video and as a Christian I also learned a lot from itso thank you melonie.
this is so well done! God bless you.
great video!! thanks for standing up!!
man I love seeing all the positive feedback on this video. someone out needs this video they just dont know it yet.
look at you  making full-blown seminars! this was absolutely awesome to watch  you clearly and concisely explained each point of woke ideology and how it was in contrast with the Bible. you and gothix seriously need to collab and do whiteboard ppt video - so many demons would be slain!
Im not easily impressed when it comes to gospel presentations  but you did a good job here. keep reading  keep praying  and keep sharing. you ll inevitably get persecuted for it  and Im sure you already have  as geek culture tends to be pretty hostile   but thats a good thing. youre gaining more reward in heaven for it. keep it up!
your smart and intelligent  very nicely done.....I truly hope this reaches at least 1 of the lost and corrupted minds and all was not for nothing.... please continue the fine work.
melonie we love you for speak the truth!
bless you
this becomes more of a comedy channel with each passing day
man  most church wont give a sermon like this.great job!
I believe this is the best video you ve ever made. also its the best video Ive ever seen that lays out woke ideologue is in fact a religion.
this was fantastic  thank you so much and I felt uplifted listening to this. also just curious what type of church denomination you attend.
this was needed  awesome video.
you made me get choked up!!! my sister in Christ. all truth youre laying out.
youre pretty amazing. praying for peace and protection over you.
thank you for your bravery. and also for recognizing that there needs to be a theory of the case. and that this is the only one that actually explains all the madness. subscribed already. proud of it.
praise the Lord! may our faith carry us through these dark times. thank you melonie for spreading good will and the message of God. merry Christmas to all of you!
thank you for having the courage to say the things Ive been thinking.
preach it!! great video!!!  and I love how you use the Bible to explain your position. itshows youre leaning on God s understanding and not your own and thats rare to see nowadays.
hey melonie I just wanted to tell you that you have killed this video and I just wanted to tell you that you did a fantastic job with it and I am so truly truly happy for you melonie. anyway I just wanted to tell you thatsatan is the devil and he will take anyone down with him that think that we as Christians wont do his job  ok melonie. anyway thats what I wanted to say bout this topic of the video and I just wanted to tell you that you have done a very very great and good job with making this video and I really like how you put a Bible verse in this video too. anyway good job melonie. hope you had a wonderful and great day today and hope you continuing to have a wonderful and great blessed evening at home and have a good night too melonie. God bless you melonie.
this is some top content melonie.
amen sis glad people aren t afraid to call it out
great work!  youre speaking to a generation that desperately needs this!
a light in this dark and dying world. thank you. starting with elon and now you and others  I was almost out of hope for my ability to speak my mind and stick up for God in this society...
yes  girl! Jesus is king! a lot of us are coming out of the spiritual closet now these days.
awesome video. I love how you went right to the sword. well said.
great video.  I will say this for those who struggle with sin  remember that God does not ask you to live perfectly because perfection is impossible for everyone  rather he asks you to try to live your life as best you can following his teachings
you are super brave for doing this. alot of people will come to fight  but you seem very strong in your faith and I for one support this.Imyself am not a person of belief however Im not one to shit on another person s faith. I absolutely and whole heartedly think woke movement is designed to split and divide instead of unite.imagine  if we all just got along. we could do such amazing things.
thank you so much  that means a lot
its because youre biblically based that your analysis is always top-flight.
you love actual storytelling because you love the greatest story.
thank you drew
very well done and presented. thank you. awake not woke!
God bless you  sister    keep going and never back down!
what a great video. really well done. thank you.
amazinghope restored in a few ways I had lost hope.beautiful to see younger crowd of strong faith growing
well thought out.  reminds me that I need to be in the Bible more  and also to look for the presence of God in the world.
you make great content but this was a hard watch it was just kinda odd maybe its because Ive fallen out of religion but Imean idk a lot of work put into the video so good job none the less even if I cant say I enjoyed it lol
a true seeker  through and through. never stop preaching lady!
enjoyed the video miss mac. thanks for making it.
bravo. even worked in an alter call at the end. really nice to see some scripture on the main channel again.
you know the truth. I am pleasantly surprised and greatly encouraged by your video.
at this point you just have to be sane to see this and know that its true  shout out to simpcast
I think a more accurate term would be  anti-Christ  rather than  satanic   but I suppose thats just semantics. excellent video!
finally someone with a voice who says this out loud!!!!! thank you!!!!! plus good to hear you go back to the Bible again. miss the short verses you used to do!
I become Christin 4-5 months ago  because young don reborn. Im happy thankful you people are preaching the good will of the Lord  and Im 19.
amen sister! we re certainly living in the last days...
melonie  my pastor preached about this very thing this past sunday! I do not think this is a coincidence  for me at least .  I was tempted to include the link to his sermon  but I dont want the enter inter-webs to attack my little church.  you did not use the same scripture that preach did  but both of you were in the same area.  keep it up.
you may have just brought me closer. I like the way you laid this out thank you.
I remember when adele lost weight people attacked her instead of being happy for her.
everyone should see this video. its outstanding. always praying for you mel.
tell the truth sis! thanks be to God!
I love that you laid out this framework of the satanic nature of the woke cult. it would make a good outline for both a lecture or sermon series. I kinda want to start on building out the lecture series idea as I have a fair amount of knowledge on the secular side of how the woke cult has piggybacked on the marxist slow march through the institutions and ultimately coopted the movement to its own purpose. when it comes to the religious side of this  however  I am quite lacking  for  even though I have been a Christian all my life  I only started my true journey with faith on october first of this year.
oh my goodness  thank you so much!  this means a lot. bless you
@melonie mac go boom   the Lord giveth the word  the women that publish the tidings are a great host.  psalm 68 11 erv
bless you  youre on the right path  and in your youth too  what a blessing!
@melonie mac go boom  thank you.
yeah my friend is an adele fan and I recall people attacking her for loosing weight. they view it as like you abandoned us  or you disliked your body so therefor you dislike us because we look that way. you could say that about a skinny person wanting to put on weight and tone up. I wouldn t think  or believe that a skinny person would publicly criticise someone s body for them no longer looking like them. very odd
thats well presented. the whole woke religion is the reason I have to protect my kids from social media and internet in general. if parents cant raise their children then someone else will do.
well  you just got me as a sub  after this brave and truthful video.
God bless you sister. thank you for this video and thank you for your time. muchly appreciated
wonderful wonderful video... Im not the most religious person  I often feel lost.. this really helped me. thank you
this is a very on-point breakdown. fantastic job you did there mel! I ll be sharing this when necessary  for sure.
this was amazing
youre a saint in the making melonie.
very well done and spoken. new subscriber here
thank you!truth is my sword  honor is my shield  and the Lord is my shepherd.
I really liked this video  it was very encouraging!
melonie  youre correct. and to describe the woke religion  isaiah chapter 5 verse 20 explains it entirely. God bless! cheers
Im so glad I found your channel with a topic I enjoy and heavily faith-based content. Christ is king  love to see you praising his name and honoring him!
thank you for posting this video. you are spot on. I love how youreference scriptures in their context to fight against this mindset that directly goes against God s living word.. the Bible.  keep preaching the truth.  ephesians 5 25-30 tells how man ought to treat his wife which many never read. thatscripture passage is what used to be in marriage vows. if men lived up to those vows you wouldn t have the domestic violence you see.
Im glad I found this channel
one of the best videos you did recently. God bless.
awesome message  and God bless you and your family.
mel got real with this one! keep it up girl!!!
melanie mac is the teacher we need in schools
what a great video  we need more of this on... well everywhere.
preach itsister!!!!
thank you so much  God bless you!
@melonie mac go boom   bless me fatherfor you ve sinned against meits been one weeksince you ve r   d me   immolation -  father  youre not a father
I liked your content before....now I love it! well done! very rare to see people uphold and even humble ones own faith! wish more Christians we re as spiritually strong as you!
melonie  I know you from chrissie mayr s simpcast  but when I saw this video come up I had to click on it. stay strong  sister in Christ. we are under attack in this world.
a great video! keep posting videos like this please. God bless you and your family.
watching this video is like a breath of fresh air.
some people got annoyed at adelle for changing up her lifestyle and promoting her health above popularity. they said that they cant relate to her now even tho its not even adelle s problem.
praise God that more people are starting to realise this
great video thank you very much for putting this out.where did you get the slideshow of woke and then biblical I d like to share that with my friends.
completely  awesome.  I have been missing the Bible verses at the end of your videos. but you went all out with no holding back. thankyou.  it is so refreshing to see someone tell the truth of our Lord Jesus Christ
thank you for saying it and keeping Christ in your heart and in your videos. God bless you and your family.
thanks for posting this. Im adding it to my favorites list.personally  Im not a Christian  yet   although I genuinely want to know the truth God  if he exists .tbh  even as a secular agnostic  Ive been morally repulsed by the degradation readily apparent in so much of woke ideology that Ive been more attracted to Christianity simply as a reaction and antidote. clearly  woke ideology is amoral  decadent  hedonistic  narcissistic  and even downright evil.  see balenciaga for example.  so  whatever stands against that immediately is attractive to me.imho  Im still not entirely sure if satan exists  or even if the entire Bible is merely wish fulfillment . yet  if satan is truly real  then there can be no doubt that he is inextricably linked to the left and woke ideology  regardless of whether the adherents are aware of the fact or not.
Ive only watched a couple of your videos in the past  and had no idea you were Christian  thats awesome. really wish I knew you in real life  youre an amazing woman  and itseems we have common interests and ideologies.  was curious what pastor you learn from  Ive always preferred pastor arnold murray from the shepard s chapel. Ive also watched a few things from amazing discoveries  like the herodian mind and the bride the beast and babylon. sorry about the long comment... I wish I could meet you! actually now that Im looking at other comments I guess its not that long
God bless you  sister. you are one of the real ones.
I   your   view of reality.
im agnostic but I agree and respect with 100  with what you sayd and respect it...things are really going downhill
hImelonie! been looking forward to this video. I know you ve put a lot of work into it. thank you for sharing your faith so honestly and often.
yes.  I think thats the selling point to be honest.  our world has fallen terribly far from grace sadly.
youre really pretty and refreshing as being a tatted Christian. very outspoken  I guess I was subbed to you but Ive honestly never heard of you until now. keep it up!
melonie  - straight up awesome! excellent video. you even dropped romans road in there
I appreciate your use of scripture.
absolute truth ! keep telling it like it is.

@melonie mac go boom thank you  I pray this video reaches millions of souls.merry Christmas
thank you so much  I worked so hard on this!
@melonie mac go boom  just finished watching and you did a great job  your hard work really showed. I hope you were able to reach and help some people with this one.
I always thought this but never said it out loud because of possible backlash from the people I knew  thank you
Ive only watched four of your vids and was not expecting that much Bible in it. I am happy to see it though. good video for sure.
this was such an amazing video. too notch.
Ive been saying this for some time.. thank you melonie
not a return of the verse of the day but I really appreciate this either way  a very good listen. please bring it back
been an interesting and good video to watch melonie.  the fact that of the far left and their political system  that youre one of few out there who see that the political system doubles as a religion to the people who believe practice worship in it and are willing to express that   Im just glad that youre one of the few out there willing to go there and stand by it.  thanks for that.
new subscriber here. not very religious anymore  but thank you for standing up and saying this. if you dont believe in satan  then this woke shit is definitely  evil at its core. continue to call out this nonsense  we stand behind and beside you.
good for you sister. truth prevails. Christ wins.
best example for me was mr. beast s recent poll on twitter where he asks if you d refuse  10 000 if you knew the cost was a random human life...almost 50  voted they would take the  10 000  and many of those people did itso instinctively they didn t even bother to read the second clause before making their decision.this is why a large portion of our youth are self-described  democratic-socialists. like you said  not all are evil  yet they follow blindly.we are not on this earth to play God.
wokeness is worse than even evil.
Ive been living with my girlfriend for 6 years now  and we ve been together for 10. the only reason we aren t married is because the idiotic tax laws in our state would make itsuch that I d lose my health insurance otherwise. in other words  this state makes marriage more expensive than itshould be.
fantastic video. youre so right. this is a fallen world that is being destroyed rapidly. revelation is upon us. scary  yet glorious at the same time. the worse it gets  the closer the return of our Lord and savior  Christ Jesus.
thank you so much for this video. I needed this message from you. youre amazing.
this is a great outline of how woke ideology contradicts the word of God thank you for putting this together I hope you have a blessed day melonie please keep it up love your channel
well put! glad I am able to call you my sister in faith.
someone I know got this tattooed on their wrist at the weekend.  happy wife  happy life  a couple of months into his most recent relationship xd
and I love when u said. God did this for us. he is exposing their works. I agree 100
a lot of other people have been saying this for a while now. I have been saying this for years. you are correct madam.
I am not religious any more  but I am really interested in what you have to say  I admire people of faith in many ways. go boom!
that was straight to the point !
never close your heart  I called myself an agnostic when I was in college. hitchens  dawkins and friends are compelling speakers. after studying more math and physics than the average brain can handle I have come to learn that the existence of God is just as logical and probable as his non-existence  secularly. I have come full circle.
Christianity is not about being religious  so that is the point that you missed. its simply a relationship with God  which is something that every religion lacks.
@beauty for ashes  its actually even more amazing than that. we re not  religious  because Jesus was religious for us. we cant save ourselves  but Jesus did.
@hotdice  I still prefer the idea of a creator  the teleological argument is compelling to me   but the idea that any one religion knows its will is off-putting  especially after I have seen people who make that claim use it to justify all manner of horrors. I guess you could call me agnostic in some ways  but Im pretty sure anyone that claims to have knowledge of the will of God is incorrect  and I will probably never go back to a set religion.
@beauty for ashes  I disagree almost completely with your statement. the  personal relationship with God  concept isn t mentioned in the Bible a single time  it is a modern contrivance.
@andrew b  I also found myself in that boat for a while before applying an almost kant-ian rationale that organized religion is the best approximation and is a net positive. not trying to convince you just sharing my story with a kindred spirit  the secular anti-God propaganda must be evaluated within us all.
@hotdice  I definitely dont think religions are evil by default  I just find certainty of any kind to be a sticky mess. thank you for sharing your viewpoint with me!
you must have faith.
facts
amen. glad people are pointing this out.
great video! there is nothing but pure facts said love the biblical analysis and study!p.s. sorry 2 cor 11 13  not 1 corjust for those who went to go look in the Bible
its not even sunday  and melonie is taking us to sunday school
preach itsister! preach it!
this has convicted me  that Ive subconsciously sought after the praise and appeasement of fellow man  using the argument of tolerance in a way to get them to trust me so I can evangelize to them. and maybe to a degree  that would have worked. but the compromise also killed my boldness. thanks for calling it out. woke is broke
Ive been watching your videos for years and Im glad that you made such a video.Im a muslim not a Christian. and I agree with what you ve said about woke ideology. there are a lot of things in common with islam and Christianity.woke ideology is terrible and hasn t done anything good for this world.
you earned my sub. good job kid.

wow. amazing video melonie. thank you  all things are of God or not.
john doyle did a great video on this topic a little bit ago too!!! glad to see someone else talk about it!!
best video ever!Ive been saying for a long time that its no longer  left vs right  its good vs evil.
dude  melonie mac is straight up preachin. I love her even more now.
do more stuff with the Bible. its awesome
you have a wonderful heart for the Lord! another verse for all the dudes out there  husbands  love your wives just as Christ loved the church and gave himself for her.ephesians 5 25 netthats a high calling indeed! keep up the great work!
@meloniemacgoboom  where can I find this slideshow you used in your video  it was so well done and I would love to have it readily available to read thru. great video!
this is common sense to me for some. im not blinded by naivete. people are easily fooled.
u just got a subscriber because of this video. good job make more content.
@b  .....wow. I hope you dont treat anyone else who comes out to say they re convicted of something they ve done wrong and are willing to change it. what s your deal  you feel threatened by someone else s genuine confession so you put them down in an attempt to elevate yourself  dont make itso obvious next time.

marvelous.    you are a diamond  in a world that does not have your intense fire of faith.    fascinating is that you kindle faith  in numerous people.     quite fascinating.
finally been waiting for this one to drop thank u for another great video melonie   God bless
spot on and well done.
thanks for making this video you are appreciated
perhaps its not a coincidence that I went straight in my feed from a glenn beck video on his own dark  repeating nightmare  and prophecy on the rise of satanism  to this one.  Im beginning to think there are no coincidences.
excellent exposition of truth!
its all very real.  be safe out there everyone.
I like these videos. you should make more. God bless you!
best video you made so far I love it!!!!
a thousand blessings upon you  mm. good work
I wonder if melonie will do anything special once she reaches 100 thousand subs
amen homegirl keep callingout the evil and sharing Jesus
wonderful video  tells it like it is.
also  I love the presentation.  well done.
excellent points. the worship of self is rampant in modern society  and we will not recover. things will continue to deteriorate until the second coming  so I guess we just need to buckle up and hold on to our faith.
I truly love you girl!
way to go! sister!
I appreciate you putting your faith out there.  whether people want to admit it or not  secular non-leftism relies upon Christianity and Christians to uphold the principles they hold dear. it is the foundation of the west.
good stuff  melonie!
looks like God wanted you to see this!
amazing as always  you are truly blessed. bringing the truth to light is powerful. we need more like you in the world.  love and prayers.
we must protect melonie.

wonderful video.  thank you for sharing
wisest words n thoughts youve got melonie mac
it takes alot of courage to do a video like this in today s world and I respect you for that . you did alot of research it looks like  how much time did it take for ya
if you haven t been cancelled yet consider yourself persona non grata after this one melonie. good to see you standing up against wickedness.
well said!
preach it!!!
I greatly enjoyed this video.  very well done  partly as Im a sucker for a good powerpoint.  if I had to say anything I would add to your slide on gluttony.  yes there is a worship of corpulent consumption  but people square that to being overweight in and of itself as being a sin a sign of gluttonous behavior.  and you did well to address that being fat isn t the sin itself  bravo.  the thing about gluttony though  if we strictly pertain to food  it does just pertain to overconsumption.  it includes eating too little  starving oneself to be thin for the sake of it.  further still and more prevalently in  high society  is the practice of selective eating.  the rich or wealthy minded only choosing to eat the most expensive foods and looking down on others who dont.  this can relate to consumptive snobbery  where one only eats certain foods  vegetarianism  veganism  carnivore caveman diet  frugivores  etc.  and looks down on other people for eating other things.  there s nothing wrong with being vegetarian  until it becomes more of a statement than anything.  someone can choose not to eat meat  so long as they are healthy about it and dont harass others who dont do what they do.  and diet culture!  thats gluttony as well when one s healthy eating is so important that you center your life around it  or use it as a means to belittle people who aren t as healthy.that brings me to something that may have been nice to say  but wouldn t be entirely necessary for the presentation.  the interconnected nature of the sins.  a person doesnt have just one sin to worry about and then they ll be fine.  every sin is connected to the other in some way.  gluttony in the form of overeating would likely be connected to sloth  under-eating could be in tandem with envy  and being picky about food for statement of self could be related to a host of vices from lust to pride.  and pride is the most dangerous vice  there s a reason its considered to be the first sin.  someone who s greatest sin is pride knows exactly how to use the vices of others and encourage or suppress their expression of sins from the self.  and its scary to think how pride is so greatly encouraged in modern culture.  to think thatso many people could very well be trying to break you for their own gains or just the fun of it  instead of helping their fellow man to overcome the shadows of their nature that follow all of us.   realize I just ranted again maybe I have my own problem with pride to work on.  to summarize  I really enjoy the topic as a whole and enjoyed this video very much.  mostly as its yet another mirror to the ugly realities of where we as a society are allowing ourselves to go.so thank you very much.  and thank you for coming to my tedtalk.
can I ask a quick unrelated question what is the software you use to make your videos
wait what  losing a friend because you spent time with family during lockdown.. good riddance I say  thats one weak friend.
in 30 minutes you shared most truths than the woke crowd has in decades.
I spent hours on the powerpoint yesterday and was hyping myself up all night  the next day to push myself to record and then post it  I know I will get more hate  but I felt it on my heart so I did what I feel God led me to do to the best of my ability
@melonie mac go boom   the flak is always heaviest when youre over the target
@melonie mac go boom  great job Im proud of ya. dont stress you ll get more love than hate so please dont focus on the hate. keep up the good work. this world has been taken over by evil real quick so its refreshing to hear a voice like yours. God is proud of you  stay strong  lol and at least you ll be able to rest your head at night and not lose sleep because you know you did the right thing
a brilliant video. hope you link this to your twitter conversation mentioned
have been following. but now Im a fan! good job.
preach sister...preach  hallelujah.
nicely done.
Im here because a hater tweeted out this video!! let s go mel
God wins in the end everytime.thanks for fighting this good fight.God bless you. merry Christmas.
based!  my prayers we re answered with this upload.
God bless you  melanie!
love the video.  great points.
I agree with you 100
thank you so much for addressing this.  I am a pastor  and I find these to be very good  scripturally-centered points that you brought up in this video  and I will definitely share these with my congregation  along with all who need to hear this  especially in the age we are facing today.  God bless you  melonie.
God bless you melonie mac!!!
awesome video glad youre saying something Jesus Christ is the way the will and the light
you my dear are correct. they may want to get mad and take it out on you but their anger is at God and the Bible. facts dont care about their feelings. they need to come to Christ...my prayer is more people come to him after all this is said and done.
thank you for your clear stance and expressing God s love thorugh his truth.
coudn t agree more
we are encouraged to take the church to the streets when needed. well done here.
prayer meeting with melonie is kinda  left  field direction but a welcome one indeed.
good video melonie!
I believe that your right about this  and it makes sense...
oh yay  my new biggest fan brought you here!
thank you so much  pastor! God bless you
this is what churches should be preaching about. you gave the facts 100  and I agree with you and everything you said. Jesus Christ is my Lord and God did raise Jesus from the dead
you just earned a follower! thank you!
totally agreed before you said anything.
calling out all my sins holy crap melonie  Im just trying to not get kicked out of church I gotta play bass sunday
u have the same perspective as I in many things. great content!.
amen mel. God bless you
this is the cutest thing I have ever seen
there is not a like button big enough for how much I love this video
this is a good church service
they definitely line up perfectly with everything that humanity in all of history has resorted to as  evil  or bad for humanity. they are what people in the past tried to warn other people in the future of what not to be. look at history in all forms. even from religious texts  because some stories are telling a story that has historical value. there are all kinds of actual historical texts talking about how various empires fell. its told over and over again how it happened and its pretty much the same story.people gradually grow to become highly naive. the governing system becomes highly corrrupted as a result. they feed into the people s delusional thought process and idiocy by inserting various ideological subversions. gradually promoting more and more ideas that are a perversion to basic beliefs. the governing body becomes more authoritarian and implementing more laws. while filling their pockets with more money and trying to erase certain aspects of history. the governing body draws a line and villainizes anyone who doesnt think like them. people with the sheep herd mentality then villainize anyone who is speaking up against the governing body. people became hateful towards one another and no longer trust each other. morals  respect  values and integrity is looked down upon and is almost completely gone. society then cant stand on its own due to being so corrupted and evil and it gradually collapses into pure chaos. things get really bad  then a new society is built from the ashes. the survivors write down what happened to warn other people in the future. then the cycle begins a new chapter and it eventually gets repeated. because no one learns from the wisdom of the past. whether you believe in religion or not... they are trying to tell you something. history is also telling you something.
wow melonie!! great work!
amen sister!
God bless you  your friends  and family.
I agree 100
I needed to see this video  thank you
the parallels between woke ideology and lavey s satanism are pretty interesting. I ll have to think more about it  but I think you could make the case that wokeness is a more juvenile  superficial  less explicitly anti-Christian satanism - minus the philosophy  occultism  ritual  etc. satanism-lite. I wonder if wokeness could be used for recruiting by organizations like the church of satan.
didn t know you were in Christ  hallelujah!
very well said.
when a dogma says that you must fight bullying by becoming the biggest bully  you know you got a problem.
excellent video !
I absolutely love how you did a whole powerpoint and everything and you are totally right and hit the nail truly a blessing in this extremely left internet
as a Christian I can say Im not perfect and Im still improving after years of lusting over women but Im slowly changing the bad habit.
nice work!
well done.
incredible video!!!
good video melonie
on point! God bless sister!
the word truth is !
love this
well said!
great video!!! love it!also  leviticus 19 28
dammit you are so right I fear for your safety
wow  my mouth fell when you hit them with ephesians and then you kept hitting them.
I turned to buddha when I realized what was going on in the world. my eyes have been opened  and I see the evils these people spread every day. I temper my mind  body  and spirit against such evils. I pray for my Christian brothers  and I hope they pray for us as well. I seek a future where evil of all kinds is weak.
ditto with your viewpoints on woke ideology  also very glad to hear you say what you said about elon. I appreciate a lot of what he is doing to bring awareness to woke ideology  but I am far from agreeing with everything that he s done. at the end of the day with a lot of the craziness going on in the world I simply have to relegate myself to the knowledge that God is in control  and all of us that believe in him must do our best to help the world become aware of Jesus and that he is the only path to true life here on earth and ultimately eternal salvation.
my faith is sort of in limbo now in that I just dont know but thatsaid  there is evil in the world and it needs to be called out and opposed.
I love how when someone says thatsomething is  like a religion  its never a compliment. its like even religious people know that religion as bad.
amen to that I completely agree
I was just thinking about this the other day. people say the woke cult is just something that came out of nowhere fairly recently  but I personally think its the result of decades of chipping down on the spirituality and beliefs of westerners  be it religion or just with faith in general. woke is really just another religion belief system  that disguises itself as  scientific progress  with  good intentions  but since the western world has vacated their lives from actual religious beliefs  they were vulnerable and ripe for the insertion of a new one  no matter how degenerate its core beliefs are.Imean think about it   decepticon  children ! thats the vilest shit ever but for the woke its a core concept because its spreads their belief into the next generation
you are crazy melonie go boom
rest assured your Christians brothers and sister pray for you and everyone!
excellent presentation.
all I have to say is  subscribed
I am a very religious person  Im a devout Christian and I agree with what youre saying here. while I dont agree with everything you say on other topics  its human and natural to disagree but its important to be civil and kind about it the way God and Jesus intends for it. I do need to loose weight  its hard and I struggle with it every second of everyday. I find the fat acceptance thing to be weird and even dumb. while yes we should not belittle people at all for being overweight because it can be a multitude of things for why someone s overweight. like their mental health  it could be like a brendan fraser situation where they did so much physicality and physical effort that it messed them up where they needed surgeries and they cant help but be a bit overweight. Im 5 10 and I weigh 308 lbs  trust me I hate myself for it everyday and I want to be better though is the thing. like there are times where I see people be really overweight and itscares me because I do not want to be that overweight like thatshow on tlc I think its called something 600 lb life. I dont understand when people are severely obese and people are being being like its all good when its not like its not good for your health at all. now my weight issues does date back to me as a kid and having body dysmorphia and I still have that now  and my own father making fun of my weight due to him being a narcissistic mental and emotional abuser to my mom  me  and my older brother didn t help me growing up at all. I do fear marriage to be honest because of how my dad treated my mom and Im scared of being treated that way all over again however  I do agree about marriage and even though itscares me to my core I still want to get married. I also do worry of what the Bible says about being the head of the house as the man  Im on disability  I have autism  schizophrenia  depression  adhd  ocd  and so on. I cannot work even people from social security even look at me and after they did their test they even agreed with me that I cannot work. so I do worry about people judging me for being on disability and Ive never even told my friends Im on it because Im afraid they ll judge Im also afraid that my future wife will judge me and hate me for it. so part of me thinks that I should be alone because of it and that I do not deserve love.basically to make this terribly long comment short  I agree with what youre saying and Im with you on this. have a blessed day and life and keep up the phenomenal work and I hope you will reply
100  agree with you
it is  but we as Christians let it get a foothold decades ago when we were the majority of the country.  we became worldly to blend in  we stopped standing for Christ and became embarrassed to even mention his name or pray over a meal in public  we loved worldly things  stopped attending church  listened to all kinds of un-Godly music  watched all kinds of unGodly shows and movies  we became materialistic and bought into the  God loves america  mindset....the list goes on.  I grew up a pastor s kid and have been in church my whole life.  we opened the door to this by watering down the gospel repeatedly so as to stop offending people.  the church itself doesnt even stand firm on biblical principles anymore  almost everything is up for adjustment to fit the times.  anytime a preacher or pastor stood up for the Bible  the first to attack him were other Christians.  for example  we let women start running churches and destroyed the roles that make a successful marriage work   the Bible is clear that men are to lead and women are to follow  dont like it   then you dont like the Bible .  we became accusatory instead of compassionate while standing firm on God s word.  our pastors and leaders became hypocrites and vultures  and the good ones were targeted by petty grievances and jealousy within the church.  men became weak and women became petty and arrogant.  churches split frequently over the color of the pews or the paint on the walls  or what such and such did or said  or even because something the pastor said that was biblical offended someone.  then the self help era came along  and young Christian leaders were marketing books and t shirts and all sorts of merchandise at events  selling cd s and other crap to capitalize on the pot of gold that awaited them.  joel ostein s church exemplifies the decay of Christian values in this nation    glitz  glam  lots of people in the seats  music  feel good vapid crap that doesnt challenge anyone...nothing solid to cling to.we as Christians set the example that the Bible is up for interpretation anytime we choose.  so  why be surprised when Christianity gets replaced with an ideology that is built on  anything goes.
bless you melonie  !
its not just satanic  its all 7 sins pride  lust  wrath  greed  sloth  envy  gluttony.
solid work melonie
the original language around the husband and wife agreement  places the requirement on the husband to create an environment where the wife feels safe and secure enough to submit to his leadership. and it points to Jesus saying  look how he did it  give your all  provide safety  love unconditionally etc etc.
1000  agreed
another big brain move is the video is exactly 3 3 1 6 long  which some translations scholars note as a certain famous number portrayed in the book of revelations. thats it melonie  go boom!
heck yes mm nice work
youre doing good
hey melonie  did you know that for halloween this year elon dressed up in a  devil s champion  costume
not what I expected from your content. I dont agree with everything youre saying  but you ve definitely opened my eyes to some of the influences are behind the woke movement.glad you decided to make this video.
I just keep moving forward until my enemies are destroyed
wow thank you for dropping this absolute truth bomb. you will come under flak but thats when you know youre really over the target. your content is signal not noise. keep up the excellent work!
had a shower thought the other day  consider the two most wokest cities in america  if not  the world   san francisco and los angeles. woke capital of the world. a place where uh.. they manufacture a lot  alphabetical  people. mostly known for sodomy and sodomy-adjacent practices. they both sit along the san andreas fault  which means earthquakes are possible there  I dont know Bible chapter citations too well but I remember from my 1st communion studies thatsodom and gomorrah was punished by God for very similar sins in a possibly similar manner  earthquakes and wildfires . I am not a super religious person but just simply making a really interesting observation.
Christ is king and Jesus is the way and the only way. Im happy to see thatstrength in faith like yours still exists!
wonderful video! stay steadfast.
given the influence of evil in the world  how else do we combat it if not through the gospel being proclaimed boldly and without watering it down  its important to argue against things like woke ideology for example  but if the gospel is not part of that  then what good are we really doing  many of us have come to the conclusion that its sufficient enough to make someone more conservative but leave them outside of Christ. at that point  you have a conservative reprobate.  sure they agree politically now but they re still lost. it may be harder work to present the gospel alongside debunking this sort of stuff  but the only solution for lasting change is converting the soul as well.put another way  the reason that these sorts of ideologies dont work is because God has designed the world to function a certain way. the reason the arguments against this stuff are so true is because of how the world has been ordered. we cant fight this stuff while pretending to have some sort of neutral ground. they aren t neutral  and we shouldn t be either.
I am so heckin shook because I didn t even do that on purpose haha!
melonie  youre right on this one.
thank you for the courage!!!!! wow!
this video was really great and I think could really help out people open their eyes.
amazing video  I am a Christian and it is the truth  this is not a coincidence  it is all prophecy  like in the Bible as in the times of noah so shall it be in the end times. God bless you and your family.
well said. matthew 5 14-16. way to stand up.
best. video. ever.
fun fact  God can help yourecover from  pressured arguments if you pray for like a month or more without giving up. hes done that to me and instead of me crying in the bedroom he can actually make me not give up on playing an rpg game on roblox.
definitely a 100  agree with you
amen sister
I had no idea you were a Christian  God bless your heart for bring up this topic.   psalm 21  1.
I wonder if the entertainment industry purposely painted faith and religion as something  tacky  these last years just to use religious imagery to represent their filthy nature so blatantly now and whoever  points out that these things are satanic are labeled  fanatics  or  conspiracy theorists. I grew up in the 90s  we teens were sarcastic  even cynical at times but whenever something like this would come up  it didn t matter if it this or that type of person is defending or not  evil is evil. the entertainment industry was successful in eliminate this kind of nuance of judgment in most of young parents kids these days. and its basic common sense to live life  thats what worries me.
you know I really admire you and how outspoken you are not giving a care about what people think and just speaking the truth from the depths of your soul.  be in the world but do not be of it
this is  by far  ur biggest boom  yet!
I know a blonde that dyes her hair black cause she thinks she talks to satan lmao Imock her to her own family and all my friends its hilarious.
I freaking love you mel!!! love your channel!!!
Im not religious but I appreciate another point of view on the woke mindset and agree that it can be a religion to some people
look into the  aeon of horus  and how that applies to the intentional destruction of old world concepts such as hero archetypes and you will understand why everything sucks now.
you are spot on.
spot on melanie.
b a s e d  God bless
gosh women like her my age are so rare... keep up the good work and tell it from the mountain tops     I wish I could find a woman like melonie in my life
perfect!!
Ive always stated that price comes before the fall! america is going to fall sadly  but God will build us back up far better than we have been! this battle is already won  we just need to submit ourselves to Jesus Christ and we will be protected!
woman  youre forever a favorite. army brats fo life.
Ive been trying to articulate this for a while. very well done.
you right!
I am really looking forward to this video. hey melonie
off-topic but your quite elegant and appealing to look at
wow! super refreshing to see you put it all out there unapologetically!! love this video! 100  solid. God bless you  girl.
awesome take on this!
melonie mac is the most beautiful frog in this lily pond.
thank you!  God bless!
happy to see your a fellow Christian
never been that religious  but the woke movement has certainly done an excellent job of convincing me of an inherent evil force in the world.
8 44  nobody in Christendom quotes proverbs!  much to our shame.  thank you go boom!
melonie  I agree with you. I highly recommend that you check out a book by johnathan cahn called   the return of the Gods.
telling a fat person that they need to lose a few pounds is not hatred  its just telling them what they need to do to live.
that hair is fire.
you took the time and prepared this for your channel
aw thank you so much!
the only thing even more alluring about you is your intelligence and loyalty to our dear Lord  God bless you ma am and have a wonderful day
I am a believer.... and have you noticed how fast everything has been moving with the woke movement
awesome video!
this is the video of the year melonie! as a muslim I can also attest that religions totally reject this woke cult. keep up the amazing work
some people were not happy about a tweet  Im shocked  shocked!
I love what youre saying here. I was saying yes and amen some many times while watching this. thank you for sharing your faith. thank you for choosing Jesus Christ. I am glad you are a fellow Christian. I know you ll take some back lash on this. but remember we love you. and we are here for you. this is a very awesome and powerful video. a part of me wanted you to keep going. thank you melonie and enjoy your day.
Im interested in how you would deal with the concept that none of the covenants are nullified  just  perhaps  refocused. but they are always in place. however  not all covenants are for everyone. the adamic  noachide  and beirt hadashah  yes. the avrahamic  mosaic    davidic are all jewish specific. they have much to teach the world  true  but each one is for the jewish nation and people individually. zechariah talks of a post apocalyptic world where   14 16   finally  everyone remaining from all the nations that came to attack yerushalayim will go up every year to worship the king  adonai-tzva ot  and to keep the festival of sukkot.   and at this point the portions of the law and sacrifices will be reinstated for all the peoples of the earth zechariah 14 21. but till then ...
this is the first time I have ever heard 1st corinthians 6 9 and 10 read on a entertainment platform
excellent video.
recently reread genesis chapter three. satan used word games to get eve to question God s only rule in eden and become curious.
best video yet.
also we should call it woke bigotry
incredible video. incredible message. incredible person. I agree 100  with everything you just said. God bless you!
thank you for putting into words what I have been thinking for quite some time.
man I havent seen a video of you in what feels like 10  years - and probably is around that time fr - and you didnt age a bit lol
once again  pastor mel hits the nail on the head
agreed
all facts  no cap
this reminds me of something written by plato - consider no plague in the world more harmful to his city than this   to let the young change at will from one fashion to another in dress  gestures  dances  exercises and songs  shifting their judgments now to this position  now to that  running after novelties and honoring their inventors  whereby morals are corrupted and all ancient institutions come into disdain and contempt.in all things except those that are simply bad  change is to be feared  change of seasons  winds  foods  and humors.  and no laws are held in their true honor except those to which God has given some ancient duration  so that no one knows their origin or that they were ever different.
as I sit here and listen to all you had to say. I feel so glad to know so many in the comments understand this. day in and day out Im surrounded by people who hate those who follow religious faith such as myself. so its comforting too see so many here giving support. its truly saddening though thatso many choose to turn away from faith. I never knew how bad it was until many found out that I was a Christian. I could see some who would avoid me if I was pointing fingers and being obnoxious about my faith. however thats not what happened. they simply learned something about myself that they didn t know before hand. I dont know if many of you are experiencing such situations such as this. it really is a eye opener for me nonetheless.
most based video you ve done.
bless you  rator
aw shucks  thank you!
im gnostic myself but I have to agree. I dunno if there is a hell or heaven or not but sjws do just seem to be destructive like nerdrotic says when he compares them to the urukaI in Lord of the rings they exist to destroy not create
amen!!!!!!!
God bless you melonie.
thank you for a well thought out biblical argument against wokeism. I also like to take their own words as an argument  what is wokeism  cultural marxism. who jumpstarted the modern cultural marxist movement  saul alinsky. what did he have to say   lest we forget at least an over the shoulder acknowledgment to the very first radical  from all our legends  mythology and history  and who is to know where mythology leaves off and history begins - or which is which   the very first radical known to man who rebelled against the establishment and did itso effectively that he at least won his own kingdom - lucifer.  wokeism is satanic as it is designed directly to be in honor of satan.
its 2 corinthians not 1 corinthians. but your speaking the hardcore truth. definitely my baby.
amen sister  amen
I believe thatspirits are carried on by the families of the deceased and priest
Im even a bigger fan now
great video  very spicy but its true  and truth is now problematic.get ready for larpers using your words and beliefs against you. hold strong.
for the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church.  - ephesians 5 23 an excellent wife who can find  she is far more precious than jewels. the heart of her husband trusts in her  and he will have no lack of gain.  - proverbs 31 10-11 trust. the primary ingredient in any relationship.  - cj  dawn of the dead  2004
my mom had never really ingrained me with any religious teachings. I ended up creating my own spiritual beliefs by studying all the religions I could find and crafting my own that fits me in my personal value system. before all this I didn t have a belief. the more I see the ideology and what its doing the more I start to believe that there was a lot of validity to the doom and gloomers. also that there s a possibility I need to truly create a relationship with God. because I know every time I see anything from this new work ideology it makes me physically disturbed or disgusted. I cant help but wonder   if I am a child of God. if I wasn t it wouldn t bother me. new chapters coming my way I guess.
hey  do you teach sunday school at all   because youre really good at this.
humanism is as much a moral system as the justifications that drug addicts tell themselves to continue feeding their addiction.
so very needed and came at the right time thank you. I dont see the discord link though.
everyone out there with a actually working brain reading this  stay away from onlyfans
I work in sf now and have noticed a shift in the new generation of san francisco residents.  I call them the egs   entitled gay syndrome.  I grew up in a generation when gays could not get married  were viciously called names  and for the most part made bad neighborhoods into better ones   whether it be the me too movement  the lgbtqabcdef movement or harry and megan   there is way too much narcism in the world.  the tower of woke  the tower of representation is the tower of babel revisited.
I appreciate this video  especially as a Christian. Im sick to death over woke content. media I love  like star wars  doctor who and marvel have become unwatchable for me.  Ive been watching nerdrotics videos. because of him  I just applied for an internship at wizards of the coast. if you dont like what people are doing  why not try and change it from within
amazing video  ty 3
amazing video and so true!makes me think of 1 john 3 18    dear children  let us not love with words or speech but with actions and in truth!God bless you in Jesus name melonie and I hope you get to have an amazing Christmas!
great video.. amen! would love to have you on our show.. if you are interested
friends and idols to I guess
God is softening your heart  you should ask him to show you more and dive into your Bible. bless you!
@melonie mac go boom  thank you. Im a little scared and anxious. I appreciate your kind words.I didn t think of itnlike that.
its in the link tree link in my description
@melonie mac go boom  cool I will look for it again
youre literally calling people entitled because they grew up with the same freedoms straight people get  bruh
really wish I could give more than one thumb up.  unfortunately multiple clicking on it hasn t multiplied it.
we can look at most of the modern churches that have gone woke. its not just the catholic church that has fallen from grace.
I am a Christian  I struggle daily to not give in to watching adult stuff  best solution for me is immersing myself in various hobbies like arts crafts like painting  basket decoration  flower arrangement  etc. Imeditate  pray  exercise  stretch my limbs  anything to stop thinking about all those clipsI have seen over the years. its best solution along with praying eery night and I thank you melonie for being a light in this dark would for me!
Im not religious but I get it
I see it more and more that Christians are the only ones who clearly see this. I think thats the holy spirit revealing it to us  and why nonbelievers just cannot see the full scope of this.
I love your hair and skin tone!
mel dropping truth nukes! nice job
depending on how you look at it  the intersectionals have structured themselves like the catholics church to include origins sin  repentance and sin  hierarchy of identity. technically anything that turns you from the word is temptation towards evil. isn t it weird how this hasn t taken root in religiously homogeneous countries
best passage to sum it at all everything you said   romans 1 21-29for although they knew God  they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him  but they became futile in their thinking  and their foolish hearts were darkened. claiming to be wise  they became fools  and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images resembling mortal man and birds and animals and creeping things.  therefore God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to impurity  to the dishonoring of their bodies among themselves  because they exchanged the truth about God for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the creator  who is blessed forever! amen.  for this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions. for their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature  and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another  men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error.  and since they did not see fit to acknowledge God  God gave them up to a debased mind to do what ought not to be done.  they were filled with all manner of unrighteousness  evil  covetousness  malice. they are full of envy  murder  strife  deceit  maliciousness. they are gossips  slanderers  haters of God  insolent  haughty  boastful  inventors of evil  disobedient to parents  foolish  faithless  heartless  ruthless. though they know God s righteous decree that those who practice such things deserve to die  they not only do them but give approval to those who practice them.
I come in the name of Jesus  by the power of the holy spirit!
its pretty awesome to see God use you as a messenger for the gospel. while your arguments are fairly simple  they get the point across and I pray that this vid blows up so that more can be brought to salvation through Christ. thank you so much and praise God!
crazy how youtube had an ad for  am I gay  attached to this video. I have reported this ad to youtube probably more than 50 times now  and they keep posting it. just amazes me how they try to shove this down peoples throats
thank you for this! 100  God bless you for spreading the truth!
as an atheist I can say that was very rational  though clearly not my belief system  but I cantell you that I would rather live next door to a Christian than another atheist
I am an atheist... but even so Im a moralist  I believe in doing the right thing  in following jonathan kent s teachings in smallville and not the teachings of joker movie. as a moralist its crystal clear the woke mentality is definitely morally fucked.
this is your best video
its crazy how we re at the point in western society that being open about your spirituality as a Christian is unexpected and brave in my mind.
you are absolutely right.
you are 100  correct. thank you for taking this bold stance because it is the truth. we are in a spiritual battle right now.
Im agnostic but I believe in judeo-Christian values and Imuch rather have a Christian as a president  or one that thatsays they are  then a satanist. and Im a huge slayer fan!
melonie  a lot of what you said is just a liberal perspective in alignment with the origins of  woke  philosophy.yes  Christians recognize that people will routinely fail to live up to their obligations and their duties  this is to your credit  since humility is recognized as virtue for that very reason. it is a rejection of the narcissistic notion that your moral obligations are entirely defined by your abilities and limitations  rather than the former being a transcendent which goes well beyond those limitations. yet the purpose that this concept serves is obvious  that we must strive to better ourselves and take whatever opportunities we re given to transcend those limitations.those who take those opportunities have always held a higher standing in the world than those who passed them up  and with good reason. in societies wherein the virtues and the vices were objective  it was not a matter of the  individual  deciding who was to be judged  but rather everyone within the group could tell if someone was a virtuous or vicious person. grace was not some grand excuse that would exempt an individual from punishment by others  it was simply seen as opportunity for self-improvement  since a person who was graced could overcome one s ordinary limitations and become a vessel for the God or  in some cultures  Gods. conversely  missing opportunities or wasting them  as such  was called a  fall from grace   if grace were absolute and pardoned all transgressions  none could  fall .this was not lost on kierkegaard  who wrote about the tendency for  leveling  as the antithesis of truly Christian passion. treating everyone as equal was a problem for this theologian since it threatened the distinction between good and evil. in an age of passion  good and evil would be seen for what they are and properly combatted. yet the age of reason made itso that people started to ignore and to excuse the harsh realities of evil.this is by no means a tendency thats absent from the woke mentality.  equality  has ceased to be  equality within the eyes of God  and rather an appropriation of those Christian concepts  such as grace  to make society an even flatland. it is not thatsocial activists embrace the right to criticize  they rather hate the very fact that they are criticized  since it reminds them of their own inferiority. this is the reason why they boo the likes of elon musk and they begrudge the likes of dave chapelle for mocking them.youre wrong to think that they are doing all of this to play at being God. they lack the confidence to play that part. they only want the benefits of living in a Godless world where only God can judge them  meaning no one can  and that is why they cancel criticism more than anything.      r.g.
totally  agree
I cantell you are smart young lady. you have put your faith in the right person. if we as Christians die and nothing happen we have not lost anything.  but if we are right and the rapture happens then they gave lost everything
oh man ive been waiting for this. video all day since u mentioned it on ur last video
adding on the male role you talked about  if you continue to read ephesians 5  the next verse says   husbands  love your wives  as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her.  men are to love their wives in sacrificial love. a love that mirrors the relationship Jesus had for his bride  the church  on the cross. choices we make  words spoken  and the environment created by men must have wives in mind. its a beautiful  check and balance  God created for marriage. men lead  so their innate need to provide is met  but they lead in a way that will always benefit the wife  so the wives will always fully know they are understood and loved by their husbands  which facilitates their submission to the men taking the lead. cycle keeps going
there s nothing wrong with being satanic  people shouldn t judge other s religions
17 27 a major part of the problem
not eating pork wasn t a ceremonial law. he told us to abstain from unclean meat for a reason. its called  unclean  for a reason  its not good for you. I always say not eating unclean meat has got to be the easiest commandment for me to follow.
I feel convicted
you are a blessing to the world. great job.
the scariest and most terrifying sentence that no person wants to hear at the end of their life depart from me  you workers of iniquity  for I never knew you!!
great presentation melonie  this was church right here. if the church I go to did this  I would go more often. my personal favorite Bible verse is -luke 8 17
thank you melanie mac.
one thing regarding the catholic church. dogmatically and doctrinally the institution of the church is in perfect union with Christ. its people who are sinners  every one. even those in power  of every denomination .
just saw one of your old vids  you look much better with your current hair.
awesome video melonie! God bless you
I was called a blasphemer for stating that if we continue to live a deliberate sinful lifestyle no more sacrifice is needed.
I personally walk more on the path of styxhexenhammer666 on the topic specifically of organized religion  but I have a great deal of respect for people who carry a personal faith and conviction that use it for good in their life and the lives of others. preamble aside  evil is evil  and this woke crap is evil. I see its roots in the old school communist pillar of worship the state  or collective  good . the communists  big thorn in their side has always been people worshipping something other than evil.
falling over and over again. life is about how we respond to those falls.
thank you! sorry its a little late  I put in a lot of work and have been overwhelmed hoping to deliver it well haha!
@melonie mac go boom  well the work paid off.  this video and the message is amazing and truly something that ppl should b hearing...  and I agree with ur thoughts on elon  I think hes a marvel super villain and we are seeing his origin story right now
you were right and what you said is in hebrews  so those who called you blasphemer need to read the word! bless you
@melonie mac go boom  thank you and may the Lord continue to bless you and your family.
so Im not gonna lie  I dont always agree with you melonie and keeping it buck you said some things in other videos that really annoyed me. I even think the whole  I dont put my faith in people  line was lowkey disrespectful. you can put your faith in people. but Imyself was raised as a Christian and basically everything you went over is considered common sense lol. growing up  me and my siblings heard all of this  we know all of this so its really strange to see how the world is going. now I ll admit I dont read the Bible  I dont pray. certainly not everyday. I dont feel the need too. and ultimately in my opinion  even if you do that. you ll still stumble and make mistakes. its just how it is. know what Imean  anyway  to make a long comment short. I appreciate this video you made and I agree with you... 90  lol.
bless you
the woke   the world is broken. to rescue it  you must become anti-racist and an ally  the solution is inside of you! scripture   mankind is broken. to rescue it  Christ has propitiated God s just wrath. the solution is outside of you in Christ s finished work.
let s not forget those american pastors whose only God is money.
great video !
once saved through the blood of Jesus Christ from his death  burial  and resurrection we are saved through him if we believe that it is true
wow  I didn t know your a Christian. new subscriber here!
facts
the fact that its about tearing down anything about the Christian and jewish faith and what s moral pretty much means that it is.
21 15 so about 1 corinthians 6  9-10. a lot of anti-Christians point to this verse as  proof  the Bible is homophobic and much arguing is done over it  but Imust share some clarification. where that verse says  homosexuals   other translations more accurately say  homosexual offenders   what its referring to is a common practice is corinth  the place this whole letter is addressed to  where men would force themselves onto their male slaves as a sort of power play. men often committed struggle-snuggles against other men in that time   place  but it wasn t because they were gay  it was to express cruel domination over their slaves. a type of really really harsh bullying. this was common knowledge throughout the land  so the apostle paul didn t need to elaborate  whatever word he used in the original language of his letter  which was later translated into english  homosexual   anyone who read it at the time would know he was condemning struggle-snuggles.from what I understand  back in the centuries when the Bible was originally translated into its most well known english versions  there didn t even exist an english word for same-sex attraction. the word  homosexual  meant something totally different even just back then than it does now. could the translators have chosen a better word  probably. but honestly they couldn t possibly have known how that word would come to be used centuries later.so fact is  this Bible verse does not condemn people for being gay at all. its not even a real mistranslation. its just that unfortunately people in modern day dont understand what it means due to a combination of context being lost to history  and the english language evolving over time.
love your channel
I look forward to the day when we can call a spade a spade without having to attribute everything to God or satan. which btw is a contradiction to remove responsibility from God to satan  since he supposedly created him  making him indirectly responsible for everything he created.
it most definitely is.
great vid. didnt know you are Christian.
melonie. response to 30 50 while Im not religious  I share a lot of my values with Christians. that being said  you dont get to choose whether to go to hell or not  you get to bet. its not a choice when you dont know if hell is even real   in the literal sense  . also I never understood the stuff about God cant do stuff  like he cant be in the presence of sin. I thought God is omnipotent or all-powerful. the argument about it being cruel is a strong one  because if thats true  God chooses to send people to eternal torment for making the wrong bet  with no chance of redemption. that being said  I really like Christianity  and the values it contains. I just cant bring myself to believe something like that. either way  love your videos  melonie!
woman ! you are preaching the gospel! yeah thats great courage.
amen!
I think its funny that a lot of people think thatsatanism isn t real. Ive met satanists and they take themselves very seriously.
1000   agree like you say
my statement about not putting faith in people was referenced from a verse in the actual Bible... that was not to be patronizing lol
@melonie mac go boom  my bad lol. I wasn t aware. I honestly didn t expect you to respond to me at all.
they re wrong too  yes. not all american pastors tho  just the scammer   false prophet ones lol
bet  what in Christianity you dont bet you find salvation in Christ and thatsaves you as far as the Bible goes. no one bets  no one randomly gambles whether they do or not. thats not how it really works.
@chandler burse  you just gave a fine example of what Im talking about
@lee bjorkman  so youre talking about hedonist atheists not really those who worship satan. yes sin is basically working for satan we get it. but we all sin really.
@chandler burse  well  what Im talking about is how society doesnt think there s actual satan worshipping occurrences and therefore are blind to their activity. lots of people say exactly what you said in your first comment. but those people aren t satanists. they are atheists who say they are satanist. real satanist  do real messed up things  but they keep itsecret. these people dont dress in goth or make them selves stand out. they are very subtle  organized and serious
@chandler burse  I dont know what you mean by the last paragraph
@lee bjorkman  Imean bad people doing bad things for personal and dumb beliefs is nothing new or surprising to most people.
bahaha I do say that a lot
@melonie mac go boom  yes you do haha   btw I was wondering wich Bible you use   I use kjv
this is really well done! Im gonna send this to my pastor.
people get mad because you call wokeness satanic  really shows where our society is at spiritually
I am against everything woke these days and I can relate to some of the things in the clip from mel but really some of the arguments are not for me. the man has to be the leader of the household is really a thing from the past thousands of years in human history. no one has to lead here  not the woman  not the man... the household of today is a shared effort and the future of mankind lies in forming a team. I like to see a partnership as a team. I find it disturbing to lead or to be leaded. I reject either concept. if a partner wants to lead me I am gone asap  I am not a puppet or a  good boy . if I see a man who wants to constantly lead his woman to household glory I avoid such a person at all circumstances.
wowzer bowzer.  melonie brought receipts!
Godspeed melonie..my biggest beef with musk is that he s a trans humanist..now Im far from a   good Christian  but Im a Christian nonetheless
bless your heart!
I love sunday school with melonie mac!!!
I would just say that its evil. there s less connotations in calling it evil and gets the point across. the satan talk wanders too far into the weeds of moral finger-swinging that I recall from the 90s aimed at video games. it isn t a good look and  honestly  preachiness gets eyerolls from moderates no matter which side is doing it. and I dont mean any hate in saying that  thats just what Ive personally observed and experienced.Im not religious but I support those who are. however  I do believe that evil exists in this world  and a key component of it is its desire to subjugate others. what do the woke seek to do  they want to beat down and control others  especially anyone who disagrees with them for any reason. they enjoy doing it. thats why their rules constantly change and they eat their own without a second thought.perhaps proper religion is the answer for the woke. maybe its shining a light on how destructive wokeness is  to show them and others what it does. maybe the answer is a balance of the two  or something else entirely.all I know is that everyone  regardless of belief  will be happier when this woke nonsense becomes a fringe super-minority.
never expected this channel to turn to love and telling the truth.  all fall short of yeshuah.  yeshuah is king.
think not that I am come to destroy the law  or the prophets  I am not come to destroy  but to fulfil.
satanism typically refers to the opposite of strict catholicism. satanism doesnt have much to do with religion beside for doing the opposite of the religious hierarchies teachings. but when you consider a lot of religious teaching is actually good for people  doing promoting the opposite just to be a contrarian is not a good thing.
perfect
this is crazy. I was talking about this just a couple hours ago. bring out the same points.
modern western societies have been on top for centuries now. we ve reached the pinnacle of wealth and power. now  like every empire before us  we are falling apart. moral degeneracy always attends the fall of empires. this process cant be stopped. we ve entered a new dark age in the west. for all her advancements  rome went astray  crumbled and fell. we are following a similar trajectory. btw  Christianity couldn t save the roman empire and it wont save ours.
as a Christian  yup.  major yup to all of this  noticed the same stuff.  especially the fact that its technically not up to God on whether people enter the kingdom of God new earth  cough andromeda galaxy cough   he simply is naturally incapable of having unintended mentality energy in his dwelling place  keep all that where it came from  the world.now  for the part in corinthians thatsays   nor homosexuals men who lay with men   I noticed that overall list is in revelations without that part.  I know apostle paul wrote corinthians yet in revelations  an angel of God is speaking to john of patmos to write revelations and didn t include that part.  will people who consider themselves Christian while being non-heterosexual and in a committed relationship really not be allowed into the kingdom of God   or do they have to not be physically intimate with anybody   is paul adding what God never actually stated about  particularly  consensual  non-hetero  committed activity
I was just thinking about being a God
regarding hell I have a different view. I dont think that Christ sends anyone to hell. but our own life full of sins takes us to a point where Christ cant save us. we need to understand thatsins are not something abstract. they have consequences on our life. just like virtues. after death we will see the consequences of how we lived our life.
spot on
I ain t even religious or anti-religious and I still hear where youre coming from
youre not crazy youre absolutely correct everything about it flies in the face of God s word
what an honor  thank you
@melonie mac go boom its very accurate.he tells his congregation to let him know if he says anything that doesnt line up with scripture. he s been at it for decades and that hasn t happened yet  but unfortunately as the woke religion gains such a following many are less as comfortable with such accountability.I ll keep praying for you.
people say there is no non redeemable point. that faith in Christ is enough to be saved. but people say different things all the dang time and it just makes it harder as a Christian with doubts to really feel like there s any solid pathway here.
thank you for hearing me out  bless you
technically it is derivative of the occult mystery religions of the ancient world.  it is a dualistic  mystical alchemical transcendental worldview.  and yes  deity in thatsense is you. and your goal is to trans to manifest your higher self  transcending the knowledge of good evil and thus become God .iow  exactly what the serpent tempted eve and adam to become.
yes. yes it is.
matt. 13 36-43 - specifically verse 40 -  just as the weeds are gathered and burned with fire  so will it be at the end of the age.  weeds in this case refers to the apostates false religion   but there are good seeds to be reaped the people who have genuinely been misled  God is trying to make sure we learn about him before the appointed time that we may change and be saved  but for many who are being misled  God knows the heart  the ones who will pay for their souls are these false religious leaders doing the misleading. they too however can still come to know God  as melonie mentioned with 1 corinthians 6  9-10  if we read on to 11 itsays  and yet that is what some of you were. but you have been washed clean  you have been sanctified  you have been declared righteous in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and with the spirit of our God.  so even when mistakes and decisions where made  willfully  if we learn the truth and make those changes  God forgives us.great video melonie  Ive been thinking saying the same thing  this woke inclusiveness  is just another one of satan s schemes to get us destroyed. he knows he cant win against God  but he also knows God doesnt want to destroy any of his children  so the best way satan can hurt God is by leading us to destruction with his lies.
what re your thoughts on the book of enoch
Imay not agree with everything you said  but I do respect your will to share your beliefs  despite the fact there s gonna be those who get angry at them.
3 03there were and are corrupt people in the catholic church  but the church itself is not as it was founded by Christ. Jesus said to peter   upon this rock I will build my church  and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.   matthew 16 18  the fact that it has survived 2 000 years is a testament to that.
its hedonism  which is basically the same thing. the sin of lucifer according to some traditions is self-interest. hedonists dont believe in virtues. they think virtues are simple fictions thatsimple people believe in. when they argue using virtues as a basis for their rationale  its just a game to them. what it all boils down to  for rational adults is self-interest  the pleasure principle. and this is why the only time a hedonist is happy is when they are high. they are constantly seeking highs. as opposed to a person who follows the path of virtue. they are content even when things aren t going their way  because they feel that at least they are trying to do the right thing. hedonists could care less about the right thing. their right thing is whatever feels good.
it is antI everything we hold dear  it is truly evil.
I got to say that I have developed more respect for you. few today who proclaim themselves to be Christians actually can find what the scriptures say in relation to certain subjects  let alone read the Bible at all.
4 we wrestle not with flesh and blood but spiritual wickedness in high places.
as someone who s still agnostic  I truly do believe that the  woke cultures  gotten a lot more narcissistic and has given me a weird culty vibes but wow really are flipping cool for just having a full on slideshow as to why woke cultures gotten more narcissistic and stereotypical though!  o
just an fyI about musk and wokeness  it is very tragically personal to him  he blames woke ideology from taking his 18 year old trans child from him  he is a angry hurting father  fathers like him strike out against what is hurting their children.
excellent application. Im just glad the cult aren t trying to cancel you for pointing it out.
amen.
with respect to the catholic church  Jesus himself told us that the church is the highest authority we can appeal to on earth with respect to sins committed  and if he refuses to hear them  tell it to the church. but if he refuses even to hear the church  let him be to you like a heathen and a tax collector. - matthew 18 17this cannot be just any church because then we could just go to a church that agrees with whatever sins we want to commit. rather it is the church which was given the power to bind and loose  assuredly  I say to you  whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven  and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven. - matthew 18 18if you look into it  this authority was given especially to peter  but the apostles in general  who have bishops who succeeded them  and the Bible talks about appointing bishops too  btw . this is why apostolic succession is so important.
eats popcorn and watches the comment section
I love that you stand strong in him.
so true about the woke evil. however  the catholic church is a direct link to Christ and a true path to Jesus and God the father. dont judge the church by a few bad apples.
I can see why you like ventI you both have equal ideologies but very different approaches to reach it and thats fine. you aren t lying about the Bible and religious or not anyone with eyes open can see something  evil  is covering the world and making people insane.
good breakdown.
oh wow  hedonism sounds miserable. I cant imagine how being so selfish could lead to a happy life  no wonder woke people are miserable
@melonie mac go boom  you might find it interesting to browse the entry for jeremy bentham in wiki. he was a contemporary of the french revolution  and along with marx  hegel  and malthus  he helped create what became the modern   socialist worldview.hedonism is a fundamental premise of his philosophy. and as wikI points out  he considered the whole idea of  God-given rights  - like what our constitution   bill of rights is based on  to be  nonsense upon stilts!  or utter foolishness. this is pretty much how the international left thinks.
afdhfgsgs no problem! I hope you have a fun time for your next video!
elon doenst think he s a savior.   he is a net positive and has improved humanity like howard hughes but prob more. I would say he s a visionary--in that the goals he wants may just give humanity a joint direction to persue--after the 2nd civil war
joshua 1 9 be strong and courageous  God bless you melonie mac!  keep going boom proclaiming the Bible with no fear!  we need it
I agree with everything you ve said. simply the best video you ve posted on this channel. this is what the world needed to hear. thank you for this video! Ive been noticing this since leaving the woke agenda in 2012. everything they ve been doing has been a damned if do  damned if you dont situation. they want everyone to sin  and be so confused they dont know what to do with themselves and break down. creating ever different situations  and being feed to think religion  the persons own family  and everyone around hates them.
saw the title and thought  ok this might be interesting. at the beginning the points were intriguing but with a few little flaws because I was thinking   well you can apply some of these to anyone really  not just the woke  but you completely lost me at the stealing slide. Imean stealing   woke  so the moment a conservative steals  they become woke  and everything after thatslide just fell apart all on its own. I did watch the whole thing  but is this a parody  no meant to be take seriously  cause I cant tell whether you are serious about it or not.
in fact  its quite simple. men and women have different and complementary roles to play. from the biological and evolutionary point of view  they have the same value. you dont need the Bible to figure it out. lionesses go hunting and feed the cubs  while the male defends the family against attackers. they are suitable for their tasks. stepping out of these roles would jeopardize the existence of the species. in humans  it is obviously more complex  our intellectual capacities making us beings in search of knowledge and the meaning of life. for this  the liberation of women from social constraints was a good thing. if we would have stayed in the 19th century  you wouldn t have had the education you had. the equality of human  races  is also very important if we are to continue to survive together on this planet. finally  the decriminalization of homophilic relationships is a characteristic of our modern and more tolerant societies. all of this is fine. what disturbs in wokism is that it looks like a religious sect. at the beginning  like in perfect dark  taking a heroine who massacres men was funny. unfortunately  nowadays the heroines in films and series all have masculine attributes  they are strong  aggressive  and often hate men. they are interchangeable. its no longer funny when it becomes a religion.
smart lady for being able to see it
well said melonie!  you broke it all down and explained things biblically.  the woke religion is the new pagan religion that is completely against the trinity and the faith.  we must rise against it and teach the lost and give them the knowledge of God s word!
agree 100  we have replaced Jesus with self-worship.
love that a beautiful  intelligent  strong woman who loves God. I pray for more like you. stay strong in Christ.
I agree with you about the woke ideology being satanic. they live these lifestyles because they are devoid of God in their lives. these people need to come to Christ  but your description of Christianity isthat of a works salvationist. your mixing old testament law with new testament grace. by these standards you could be condemned for your tattoos  which would be considered idol worship in the ot.  you shall not make any cuts on your body for the dead or tattoo yourselves  I am the Lord. -leviticus 19 28instead  we need to accept the gospel of God s grace in which we have new hope. no one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment. for the patch will pull away from the garment  and a worse tear will result. neither do men pour new wine into old wineskins. if they do  the skins will burst  the wine will spill  and the wineskins will be ruined. instead  they pour new wine into new wineskins  and both are preserved. - matthew 9 16-17the law was given to show us that we needed a savior. we cannot follow the law as imperfect beings. infact  the law was never given to the gentiles. the gospel is about Christ offering his life to us a free gift and any work done in our lives as Christians   is done by the holy spirit.... not by us.   for it is by grace you have been saved through faith  and this not from yourselves  it is the gift of God  not by works  so that no one can boast.  --ephesians 2 8-9I dont mean this disrespectfully   but unfortunately  you misinterpreted more than a half dozen verses.  Jesus came and fulfilled the scriptures and he imputes his righteousness to those who believe in him. our salvation is based on faith alone in Christ  not in turning away from sin. salvation cant be lost because it was an unearned gift.  when you come to Christ at a conversion experience  youreceive the holy spirit and forgiveness of sins   all of them --permanently.  how many of our sins were in the future when Christ died for them all sin is bad no matter who commits it  and we as Christians can be just as bad as an unbeliever at times. the difference is  we are set free.I think a better approach than pointing a finger of condemnation at these wokies  is to try to win them over by relating to their humanity  if they have any  and showing them we are imperfect like they are...then maybe we get them to lend us their ear to listen to the gospel.  imo
I 100  agree and have been saying the same thing all along-there s a lot of gay people out there that are not inherently evil nor are they satanic but there are a large portion of them that are not fully aware of the origins of the ideologies that they are promoting-
God bless you.
best video you ve done.I d like to add thatsatan isn t in hell. thats not biblical. if he were  even did he get there  the rebels  adam and eve didn t go to hell and burn. abel was the first human to die  but didn t go to heaven. by Jesus  own words we understand no human died and went to heaven before him because he did it first. see  this concept of heaven and hell after death isn t biblical. its cope and it cheapens the punishment. Im isaiah 18  the soul that is sinning  it itself shall die. so  the soul isn t indestructible for one. for two  from the days of adam to the 1st century Christians  nice of God s people believed in a rewarding heaven and a punishing hell. in fact  the hebrew word  sheol  is the same as the greek word  hades  which is the same as the old english word  hel. that is  the pit  place of concealment. hence  in english you have helmet  shelter  helicopter  hell.revelation 20 is the only place one will find the lake of fire. where does john see it  of note  this revelation is given to him in signs and portents  per chapter 1. so  this lake of fire is symbolic. taking it  itsays that  amongst other things  hell will be tossed into said lake of fire. that lake isn t in hell  but hell will be tossed into it. the angel tells john that the lake represents the second death. of note  though there s a resurrection promised  there isn t one for the second death. being put to death after Jesus fills his function as king for a thousand years has no get back. this is in line with chair 21 of revelation and apostle paul in corinthians. after the final enemy  death  is destroyed  Jesus will give back the crown to the one who gave it to him and God will be all things to everyone. death and pain will be no more. the former this will have passed away. so by tossing hell  that is  the grave into the lake of fire  God s promise is that there is no more death in his kingdom. the tent of God will be with mankind.the hellfire doctrine tries to scare people to God. the Bible makes you wanna love God. the first 3 verses of revelation 21 gets me so emotional.now  adam  eve and even judas didn t burn in some fire. why should we  especially since Jesus bought us with his blood  the hellfire doctrine makes no sense.on the other side of the wall in jerusalem there was a place that had fire that always burned. they threw things in there to get rid of them. it was called ghenna. Jesus used this in his parables and teachings. why its translated at hell when the greek and hebrew writings used ghenna  I dont know.also  look at him of job. when God gathered the angels  satan came in. moses wasn t born  so no book  scroll  tablets. where did satan say he was and what he was doing  he wasn t in hell during adam s life  job s life  Jesus  life  apostle john s last days. no record of God s people scared to go to sheol. jacob  when he thought his son was dead  begged to go down to sheol. a righteous man wanted that  job s wife told him to curse God and die. Jesus was in hades for 3 days. the kj uses the word hell in place of hades. see how the doctrine differs from the Bible  gotta go. this was your best video!
Godspeed maam.
God bless you  melonie.so many people are afraid to stand by their faith and call a spade a spade or satanic.. satanic.thank you.also sus of musk  too! God bless you!!
nothing related to your point.  Im an atheist  so biblical verses have nothing to do with my dislike over the whole woke thing.  thats its own can of worms.  I just wanted to encourage you to read more about satanism  aronra is a good jumping off point   as it differs from  devil worship  that most attribute to it.  its always best to go into a theological discussion with at least some understanding of the other viewpoint.  I have no idea about the hindu faith  so I d be an idiot to argue theology against a hindu adherent.
God s goal for Christians is for each to become exactly like Jesus Christ.  you should be more like Christ each day that passes.  if you are still the same today as yesterday  you are not growing in Christ.
excellent!
you are dead on with pornography. I struggled with that for years. as soon as I was able to kick that addiction through Jesus I had a giant weight lifted off my soul. if you struggle with this read your Bible. listen to it if you dont have time to read. its a free app  and also pray for Jesus s help. if you truly want to fix it he will help.
the Jesus is with you.
I didn t say he thought he was a savior lol
@melonie mac go boom  yes dear  Imeant he himself would agree with you.  love you on simpcast          I shouldve added the word  himself  to properly emphasize.
thank you so much raI  I appreciate you
satan isn t in hell yet  I didn t think I implied he was
Imight not be the type that goes to church  but I do believe there is a God and that there is a concept of good and evil. also perfect description for the wokies. the one thing about the Bible that fascinates me is the noah s ark. funny enough  a girl thought I was a preacher when I told her thatshe should be careful of the choice she has made.
being a satanist and watching people not understand the diversity of thought in the movement is kind of sad. thatsaid  I understand and can empathize with the positions stated here  I just find them at best  misguided at worst wholly insufficient to prove anything other than some twitter users are kind of cringe. just my perspective  but interesting dialogue none the less.
yeah no pun intended but someone could even play devils advocate and confirm these things are true  if they are spiritual in any way. many of them dont even know evil is whispering in their ear. the only way you wouldn t subscribe to this belief is if you didn t think morality exists at all  let alone legit Christianity. if you say youre Christian and dont believe these things  get real you aren t an informed Christian imo.
I am a religious man  and yes. your correct!
Im trans  not religious . . . I do have faith in something more  and Ive been told Im spiritual . . . but yeah organized religions are too toxic. especially the conservative and liberal religions of  Christianity  and satanism. and yes Ive noticed a lot of liberals are satan worshippers.Im sorry but I would trust  Christians  over satanists any day. Im not trans by choice  I have had gender dysphoria since I was at least two years old  but thats only when I realized there was a difference. I didn t really understand until later  just people who would now be called  transphobes  mistreating me for being a girl instead of a boy  made me wonder why that was a bad thing. once I could tell the difference in the actual parts  I knew my body was so wrong.and unfortunately my neurological parts confirm that as the severe depression I had my entire life that no antidepressants helped with  was fixed once I started hrt. and a doctor years ago did suggest that my body might not be able to process testosterone  which makes sense. I thought it was ptsd but really . . . when I noticed . . . I cant say I noticed I wasn t depressed because that was my baseline literally my entire life. when I noticed I was happy and not thinking about self harm  I started looking into it and found out it was because of hrt. any God that would say someone should just live with depression is a God of hate and intolerance. prove me wrong. Im happy. Im getting healthy finally. Im becoming myself. and I hate woke ideology even though it claims to offer me protections.Im sorry but any offering protections to me while preying on children does not represent me at all. Im not religious. I hate american politics so Im very much not supporting any political side. I speak for myself. only. I dont speak for the trans community  the lgbtq  community  no one. just me. woke is insane. the things that are accepted just because to not accept them is phobic is just madness. Im trans. I have gender dysphoria and have my entire life. I know that people without gender dysphoria that go on hrt have the opposite effect that I did and yet I have to be silent or be kicked out of my communities because to even question why we dont question people who admit they dont have gender dysphoria is somehow transphobic  how many destransitioners does there have to be before being trans gets banned  its almost like . . . this is insane to suggest . . . but its almost like woke ideologies seek to push conservatives to make people that fall under the hellscape umbrella that is  woke   become victims.why  because there s money in victims. create victims through predatory means  with conservatives reacting and becoming the scapegoats  and profit from donations to various charities that might help a few people with 1  of the profits but then turn the other 99  into bank funds for the founders. great. its almost like this very thing has happened before. its a scam and should be illegal but is socially accepted because f my very identity right  I feel like who I am as a person is under attack by the very people who claim to be protecting me. and the people who are supposedly enemies . . . I dont know Ive been told Im sick and yes transitioning is the cure but God hates me because of it.God made me like this. fuck any God who would make people a way and their only ways out are . . . logging out or doing something that  God  views as unacceptable.I cant go back to how I was. I was constantly thinking about and attempting to log out. I cannot go back to that. I was on so many antidepressants through my life and instead of making me better they made me worse. oh right  and Im autistic. so yeah medicine doesnt work as advertised on me  which I guess is common for autistic people. but estrogen is working miracles so . . . oops . . . I said the m word for something that God hates according to people who dont have a clue what God says and can only push their own prejudices on . . . yikes shame on me  sthe  s means sarcasm and is only for  yikes shame on me . the rest of everything I said is sincere.
time to get to know Jesus  cause he is coming whether you believe or not.
amen  well said
now if only we could get the protestants to stop calling catholics satanic too  that d be progress.
a good video overall  but there is a problem.  shall not inherit the kingdom of God  does not mean  shall not go to heaven  it means that person has no rewards in heaven. obviously a person who is not going to heaven has no rewards there. but there are people who go to heaven with no rewards  as outlined in scripture. this is not a good thing  and nobody should aspire to it. but salvation is by grace alone  received through faith alone. in no way is it dependent on how we live. if it was  it wouldn t be salvation.
melonie oh my  goodness
as a man of faith too  I d recommend that you study more about the construction of the Bible. it was created through numerous committee processes  edited  translated and rewritten numerous times  often with some very human aims in mind rather than spiritual. a literal interpretation of the Bible is childish. you have to read it with an extremely critical eye. just about everything outside of Jesus is a waste of time. the old testament is steaming garbage. lots of the book reflects the political interests of the day. like I said  follow Jesus s lead and you d be living a Godly life. the other stuff is some irrelevant bronze age goat herder nonsense mixed with medieval propaganda.
preach it  sister. lol.all hail the king  Jesus Christ.
we atheists are thus our own  Gods   and as beneficent  deities  we can offer love to those who deserve it and deliver our wrath  within reasonable limits  upon those who seek to cause us- or that which we cherish-harm. funny how you can just replace that word and itstill sounds exactly the same. yes  that applies to b.s.  lack of belief  atheists too.
I ll pray for you. I say that from the point of view of someone who has been a Christian since long before the advent of megachurches  who recognizes so-called  evangelicalism  as a pseudoChristian cult. stop listening to the man in the pulpit and start listening to the still small voice and you ll agree with me. a man can lie to you. God will not. cuI bono
I didn t like the attack on the catholic church.  there are corrupt people in every religion.  the catholic church as an institution is not corrupt evidenced by its very existence for 2000 years.  good job on representing the Christian ideology though.  I cant comment on your representation of woke ideology  but Im pretty sure there are people who fit each one of your characterizations.
yes! pure evil.
I watched your videos every day  I kind of agree with what you say but like similiar sites  I always keep watching to find out what s behind it. every time one of you shows their real  message . Im not woke or antiwoke  Im not left wing or right wing. I just want good quality entertainment without agendas and that applies to woke  religion and politics on both sides. but I think using the Bible as a weapon in this fight is a step too far  you can find quotes to backup any opinion  I know my mum was a Bible teacher. but I love your other content so
your hair is always so pretty
she is right and not enough people saying it.
its not about being religious. stop throwing the word religious around you people in the comments. what we have is a relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ our king and savior. if you still believe that following Jesus is religious then you dont know anything at all. its not about Christianity. if you need an example for religious people then think catholics. they have a religion  a dogma and a government headed by the pope. meanwhile we are headed by God. idolaters versus the holy spirit. statue worshipers versus children of the living God with no form. in order to leave religious behind and realize that we are not all religious and shouldn t be  begin at the commandments  the five books of the law of moses  and the new testament where Jesus fulfills the law  he completed the law and created a new covenant with us. we are not religious.
please consider taking an active part in a local church!
I didn t say catholics we re satanic  I said the catholic church as an institution had been corrupted
like I showed in the video  hebrews says if we go on sinning deliberately then their no longer remains a sacrifice for us. this would apply to lifestyle sins
@melonie mac go boom  that passage is often misunderstood and hotly debated among Bible scholars. it is a compare-and-contrast between the gospel and the old sacrificial system. it is not talking about sinning away your salvation. this would be impossible even according to other statements in the book of hebrews. hebrews was written to jews  many of whom believed the gospel  but many were still on the fence and were trying to maintain the sacrificial system when the only valid sacrifice was Christ s. the passage is basically saying that if youreject Jesus  you have no atonement  but can only look forward in fear of the day of judgment. the analogy is made more clear in the next verse where it talks about someone rejecting the law of moses and being killed for it. rejecting the gospel under the new covenant is a parallel to sinning willfully under the old covenant.
yup  atheism is following satan too. there is no in between path  we either serve God or we serve satan
@melonie mac go boom  dumbest thing ive heard today. but its still early
@cmiller0116  if youre going to call what someone said  dumb  you aught to use correct grammar. its has an apostrophe  and sentences end with punctuation. shame how you dont understand she clearly meant worshiping a God is binary. but I wouldn t expect someone like you to understand nuance.
please dont throw shade at the catholic church because of the stories you ve been told
is there a hack that will allow me to  like  this video 81 000 000 times
honest question here. how can you take matthew 5 28 at face value when Jesus is clearly speaking in hyperbole elsewhere  why not  say the bodily  mutilation he apparently advocates in matthew 5 30  or scorn for one s parents in luke 14 26  or that apparent call for violence in matthew 10 34-36  I just dont think you cantake everything Jesus says at face value  nor am I certain his admonishment of lust in matthew 5 28 has any real application toward something like pornography. itseems the point of matthew 5 28 and matthew 5 30  if I were to hazard a guess  is that we alone are accountable for our sins.
this has been a great video thank you for your words
well said. love ya. one savior... Jesus.
the Bible is not misogynistic in whole but paul was. he was not Jesus. he tells you not to speak up and just ask your husband and at one point basically says treat him like you would Jesus. personal opinion. if its not straight from Jesus dont treat it as gospel.
you as a catholic should also forgive woke people for doing what they do
you just got a new subscriber
wish there were more women like melonie out there.
in the 80s us metal fans were considered satanic..
satan is the God of this world and why Jesus said that his kingdom was to be no part of this world and as such those who follow Jesus were to be no part of this world
wow   why are you so hard on yourself in these regards to your faith   first of all  humanity should be loved   and not a single person should go without it   well to actually get humanity to love them selves in knowing that you are love itself   well that is another story   well people will make up all sorts of garbage why they are not worthy of love  well you are worthy of love   because you all humanity are God the sun  the living word made flesh!!! and being the sun of God makes you just that God   being God  is not an insult to God  its a celebration and a truth of you !!!
youre so funny. criticizing people for  making stuff up  as you see it  but they are legitimately doing these things as a way of adjusting their own lives as makes them happy. the same way you criticize and cope and try to feel your own sense of security with your Jesus fan fiction. you made a 33 minute video just spouting your own ideology as a reason for disrespecting others because of theirs. yes  some bad eggs in the woke community doing the same as you are here. but if you need a Bible quote   first extract the rafter from your eye . matthew 7 5... there is no difference in the hateful results  between your dogma and theirs.
exactly!
if you ever had a point with your accusations of grooming  you thoroughly ruined it by blaming it all on an ethereal mythological bogeyman. good job.
spot on
I dont subscribe to the God satan cinematic universe  but I think youre right that many woke do just as much as Christians  only on the other side. personally  wish we d all get out of the dark ages  but thats me.
I respect all peoples religious beliefs and I consider myself antI woke but I find your generalised comments about the lgbtqI community offensive as much as Im sure you would if I said all Christians are Christian nationalists
I like your videos  but youreally need to read up on the history of the Bible and how it was put together. having said that  what is your take on leviticus 19 28
amen
during that time  women were interrupting during service and that is why paul told them to keep quiet. paul was not misogynistic  he had women in high position at his church
@melonie mac go boom  I will look more into this. Ive had a hard time with paul and having mainly stuck to the first 4 books then revelation. just remember him saying stuff about women a lot. maybe its just a translation issue or maybe an issue with his writer while he was in chains. but I find myself questioning if I could hear Jesus saying some of the stuff paul says. thank you for reading and responding  .also go steelers
she s not catholic. she s an evangelical Christian.there is a big difference between the two.
@fillwithheart  is it that big though  you still need to forgive your enemies.
leviticus 19 28 was referencing a pagan scarification practice  not tattoos.
@melonie mac go boom  sure...if you say so. seems quite clear that itstates you shall not tattoo your body  but then again  everyone likes to interpret scripture in whatever way is beneficial to them. this is one of the main reasons Im not religious.
the amish  the woke  and the roman catholic church suffer the same fate as pharisees. they choose to defend human traditions customs political correctness over God s word to prevent what they fear. do not become so obsessed with doctrinal purity that you become your own standard of righteousness. choose mercy and compassion over being self-absorbed and mindless legalistic servants to false piety.
Im no Christian nor am I religious.however  I see the logic and I find itsobering to hear a religious view on this.my faith is in my freedom  as such I do not believe in woke culture as it is oppressive and it diminished the competence of as all and our responsibilities.as a child I d have written you off as a religious fanatic. of course I woild be wrong. without the woke culture attack as both  odds are we d never hear one another.thay will be thire own undoing. as such we are not at war in my opinion  but instead we are witnessing a group dragging as meny down with them as thay can rather then face the flaws in thire beliefs.Im dyslexic and apologise for any mistakes  good video and I hope pepole will listen without writing you off or without over agreeing with no individual view on this themselves.
sorry to say  that although I love a lot of the content you put out  I tolerate the odd mention of your faith and your religion in your videos but in the same vein  in those videos you mentioned that the woke culture accused you of your faith being the driving force behind your content and you flat out denied that it was the case. then you bring this out which only confirms what they accused you of  unfortunately   which comes across as that you might be hypercritical.please dont get me wrong  I will still watch your other content but bringing religion into it  is not for me thanks  but I will praise you for putting out what you believe to be right.
this only shows how glaringly obvious your misunderstanding of modern satanism truly is. its a shame you ve become just another youtuber thatsays  bad thing   satan   and pushes thatsame right-wing satanic panic rhetoric thats been proven false for decades. either way  I hope you profit off of and enjoy your upcoming daily wire endorsement and Im looking forward to seeing all of your incredibly na ve and targeted movies that are yet to be announced.
15 10 video melonie  extremely based
idk about  cornography  but I am a fan of korn
well done melonie. sometimes its hard to teach truth but we need more people like you who will do it. furthermore everything you spoke is correct. I did not see you take one verse out of context. I hope it goes well with you and your family.
I agree so fucking much!!!!!!!!
using melonie s logic here  Christians and muslims are all jewish because gee golly they sound the same.
yes
amen sis
why do Christians think the opposite of Christianity is satanism  its enough to describe it as a cult or religion. to say its specifically satanic just makes you sound ridiculous  no offense.
so help me out here Im not allowed to drink or I can drink but I cant drink too much
yes it is
true bravery
go boom mel !!!

I dont know what videos you make but you ve earnt a subscriber from this vid. wokeness is evil and unnatural.
it was catholic scholars who assembled the Bible over many years  guided by God. you jelly.
I d add that my brother is gay and I dont think he is bad. I d hope most pepole would agree  however I am curious as to youre opinion on this. if youread this.I also think fat people aren t bad but just struggling. my mother is fat since I born.  I am a triplet genuinely Im curious because I see youre opinions and I get the sentiment. but I see those I love on the border of youre criticism and yet I think they d agree with you but to a lesser extent.
thank you so much for taking the time to hear me out on my video  bless you
@melonie mac go boom  no melonie  bless you.you ve got courage. one day I d love to talk to somone who thinks like you and see the logic in real time.youre very obviously intelligent and genuine. I believe you believe what you say. I dont know more than God. but in what might be hubris  without seeing proff of God  I cant give myself to him. weather I already am or not.wonderful video. but dam lady  that video takes balls to make. I suspect you ll be fine through all this. if you get hate then simply ignore them. its just the way of things.
wont lie she seems ..confused of what she wants in life right now.
she showed plenty of receipts. where are yours  hmmmmm
@morb 357  correlation     causality.
@david lindsey  ahhh a destiny argument. you also probably want a study. well  its all outlined in the Bible and she showed the receipts without moving any goalposts. either you have faith  or you dont. your soul can live forever  or it can die. make your choice. I know mine and its not up for  debate me bro.  enjoy the burn.
definitions are tricky  and a lot of them depend on self identification.  there s not a lot of evidence that the new testament authors saw Christians as  not jewish   but that perception developed some time later. similarly  we cant define  religion  in a way that includes taoism but not communism  other than  these ones.  birds are dinosaurs  the paleontologists decided a while back  but if they never stopped being dinosaurs  its suddenly not clear that they  or we  ever stopped being fish.
@william walters  thats not how genealogy works  we never  stopped being fish  - we and everything downstream from fish are technically also fish according to evolutionary biologists. dark horse has an interesting discussion about it. anyway  definitions dont become less tricky by mashing them together and getting them wrong.
@mungeparty  I ll take your word about vertebrates and fish being practical synonyms. but Christians and muslims are jews in the same way   they sound the same   up to a point  because many of their ideas have a common ancestry in judaism. definitions are trickier regarding religion than biology  though  in that it isn t clear what criteria we should even start with. are jews for Jesus Christians  jews  they claim to be both  but many jews might dispute that. similarly  latter-day saints claim to be Christians  but many other Christians disagree. shrug my point is just that  it isn t obvious to me where if at all melonie went wrong in pointing out commonalities between woke ideas and  laveyan  satanism. I think the comparison to marxism would have been stronger  but thats been done to death.
I get what youre saying because I used to think like this 100  when I was agnostic. but I came to notice that when people dont put their faith into God  they are usually putting it into themselves or some other worldly entity. I used to think witchcraft and satanism was overblown by Christians and not a real problem  but the point is that its actually something that hides in plain sight to deceives people  or its disguised as something outwardly  nice  or desirable. like identity politics is preached as something tolerant and helpful when in actuality it divides people. people usually follow these things with good intentions and its not usually someone praying directly to satan  though that happens too sometimes . they aren t bad people.a good example of this is  new age spirituality   which combines many older  religious practices and mysticisms  where people put their faith into crystals  old Gods and random entities  and they often come to believe that they have supernatural abilities. this is very popular for young women lately because it makes them feel powerful. you might ask  what is the difference between that and believing in God  its that they put their faith into themselves as a flawed human instead of into the concept of a loving entity who created everything we know. they attempt to  manifest  things they desire  like money or a relationship  what canthe world offer me   basically empowering worldly desires over God. they even warn that you can manifest bad things if you dont think positively enough  which is scary since no human being thinks 100  positive all the time  and they aren t lying. if one starts to dream of demons  see many repeating numbers  or things that just dont make sense  they will blame it on that person s thoughts just not being positive enough.  meanwhile God understands that we are imperfect and that we will sin  but he wants us to repent and try to be the best we can be. sorry for the long response  I just find this stuff interesting. a lot of people think there s no spiritual world and its all just bs which I kind of get too  but through my personal experiences I do think there s something to it.
thank you melonie
love the vid.
woman with  gojira  tattooed on her arm spitting scriptural facts  oh  this is getting shared around.

sunday school with melonie mac
uwu religion I believe in disney aswell
I do not remember which religion I am  Christian or something else  it has never been big in the household that I am living in so I kind of forgot over time  but even so. I do know that man and woman need one-another to grow and improving one-another. I am not a religious person but maby I need to take a look back at some stuff at least understand the lessons that are giving to us. I always have taken stories to heart fiction fanatsy stories like  Lord of the rings movies  or not. but yeah I do understand that this woke movement is harming humanity as a whole.
watch zoolander 2.... its saying literally this to your face.
thanks!
melonie  as I read through the comments  I am moved by all the hearts that you have touched today. God bless you and praise God!

I dont think  happy wife happy life  has to take the meaning of  do what the woman says all the time.
great video and while I agree with most of it  there are times that I feel you were not as prepared to discuss it as much as the other portions. for example  the corinthians 6 9-10 where God lists off all the unrighteous you called them sins yet one should recognize that God does not expressly say  you will be sent to hell  but rather just  you will not inherit the kingdom of God  meaning you will not be rewarded. another example is if you are married  what if youreceive a head injury and can no longer make the decisions regarding or work anymore  would God want the family to starve  God helps those who help themselves after all. even saying God is the same always and forever isn t necessarily true. reading old testament and new testament shows God both flooding the world to kill everyone with sin to sending his only child to die in a horrible way for people s sin. that is part of the problem with the Bible is there are ways to interpret things and thats because of humans in the days God spoke  not him.with thatsaid  I again agree with you for the most part. while I would not say  woke is satanic  being woke is not the way God intended things.  God says love thy neighbor . there is no caveat to that. its not  love thy neighbor unless... . God also created man and woman... not man  woman  and 60 other pronouns. those who believe in God to not put themselves above others but alongside them as equals as we are all equals in the eyes of the Lord. thank you for making this video and speaking of God s word.
I couldn t agree more and Im an atheist
not religious so after 7 minutes I think I will just pass. this isn t for me  I tried tho xd anyway... see ya in the next video.
deus vult!
you have sweet soft eyes.
since  I am still a single man... I am just using free porn not even onlyfans to release my stress... is it ok  I dont do any other stuff you mentioned. also  can husband use porn to release his stress if his wife dont want to participate  thanks.

@melonie mac go boom  thanks  melonie!
haha yeah  stick around and maybe you ll learn some things

I still get weirded out when I hear  Jesus ... after finding out his actual name   yeshua   and only referring to him by that name  for many years  now... the translation   Jesus  just throws me off.

melonie mac go boom is awesome  wonderful  and amazing.  she is a role model  women should look to her.  woke-ism is religious in nature  and it is a clown show.  as you know  the symbolism of the clown is about the foolish  weird  second best  and bizarre for the entertainment laugh.  the difference here is the kingdom of darkness is not funny  because this is about real life  our laws  our people  our language  our borders  and our communities.  the kingdom of darkness is a demonic circus  we see counterfeit authority  illusions  lying  deception  delusions  invention of evil  pride  anger  uncontrolled wrath   greed  perversions  secrets  secret agendas  the public speech is different from the goals   altered language terms  you are using common english as two different languages   and  inter alia  secret groups.  and then  of course  the darkness  where sins are not defensible for being second best choices  therefore  we see code words  altered language terms  language practices to conceal the true intentions  and censorship  cancel culture   it isn t about truth and it is not progressive  that is a term used to cloak intentions   because it is about mind control  and then it becomes a shout down.  we openly see the practice of witchcraft of intimidation  manipulation  and domination for control.  witchcraft includes inequity and rebellion with legalism  that means using the rules for only yourself  we see hypocrisy .  as religion  witchcraft also promotes spirit worship  of your own personal Gods and idols  that are your values  and we see the Gods of sex  money  and military power among them.  we see them wanting all government authority in military power  this includes the police  that is a form of military  it is why many of them use military ranks  to control everybody in tyranny and fascism  you shall obey or suffer the worst .  they are not abolishing the law to give freedom and liberty.  liberty means without license  that is how the government controls people and things  and this enables corrupt judges and bribery of political powers and authorities to look the other way  they are using the law to control the people for personal agendas  and then using the political payouts  bribes  and kickbacks to serve their God of money.  community impotence comes with lost liberty  because the bribes causes everybody do to less  because it is a licensed monopoly  and nobody is looking  and nobody can look  dissent is silenced .  why should they care in their licenses   the law remains  and it is empowered to control anything and everything. in the light of Jesus Christ of the Lord God.  Christ is a shepherd  that means leader  and he puts his sheep into pens to protect them  with the shepherd at the gate.  the sheep know the shepherd  and the shepherd enters by the gate  where the thieves  the lions  and the wolves enter by other means.  the pen is made of stone walls  and this means borders.  in the symbolism  almighty God demands borders  so that he can bless us  otherwise we create the situation where the wolves  the lions  and the thieves enter.  borders means laws  rules  and literally borders of property rights  that include state and national borders.  we have political leaders who claim that they didn t invite in the wolves  but they create the situation where the wolf does enter by failure to put the sheep within borders  and this is where they are guilty with the wolves  it is like entering a wild biker bar with hell s angels  and you might feel safe for a moment  because you paid for your drinks  fair and square  no trouble   but pick a fight  in the results  you created your own hospitalization by choosing the wrong place  instead of going home to your borders to have a drink.  meaning  woke-ism destroys borders  because they enter with the thief  lion  and wolf  and they like it that way  for a bunch of fragile weirdos  they created their own hostile world.
you lost me......
as a big fan of satan  the wokes get on my nerves too tbh.
aright tbh... im 6mins in and im bored af  I thought this vid was gonna be spicy  not some Bible study bullcrap. if I wanted to listen to someone rant about some imaginary thing in the sky  id check myself into a psych ward

elon musk is not religious
I dont take issue with satanists or Christians specifically  I take issue with what individual people do.  as long as youre not bothering me  I dont care.
just a thought  romans 8 28  and we know that in  all  things God works for the good of those who love him  who have been called according to his purpose.  the way I see it  you can either look at the woke phenomenon as either  some kind of satanic ish like you mentioned  or  you can see it as God presenting new things into the world  to guide us in the directions that he needs us to go. whether it be  for  or  against   said ideology  or the many other things that God has called for all of us. if we say  God  is the almighty  then there is nothing more powerful than God. and if this is true  then nothing cantake place  without God s knowledge  or God s allowance. therefore  if God has allowed the  woke ideology  to be in the world  for the time being  then imo  it is but another tool used to manifest  all that it does. even on its most basic of levels  so many content  youtube creators have gained so much traction on their channels  discussing this topic. though many of the stories may be on the negative end of the  woke ideologies  being implemented in shows and movies  its positives  are surely  all the more views and topics to be spoke about from youtube content creators. basically  imo  any battle left to fight  has been dealt with thru Christ our savior  speaking as a Christian.  so again  if all things work for the good  then I can find peace in that. sorry so long
I dont belive in satan. this is satanic
I was raised Christian and am currently agnostic. I do not subscribe to any religion  as I personally am not convinced that any scripture written by man from any belief system  whether the words supposedly come from their God Gods or not  tells the whole truth or holds the answers. I have my reasons  all of which Ive made peace with. it is not out of hate or nihilism.and I reserve my right to change my pov at any time. I dont claim to have any answers or know more about the unknown than anyone else. I dont preach to convert others to think or feel as I do. Im more focused on my own personal relationship with my faith right now. as far as Im concerned  the preaching is better left to someone else. thats not my mission.frankly  Im not interested in it. I do believe wholeheartedly that  reality  involves countless things forces beyond our comprehension or capacity to detect with our five senses. to believe otherwise is naive at best and arrogant at worst in my opinion. whether those forces watch over us  expect something from us or are sentient at all  I dont know.and Im okay with not knowing. the unknown is to some extent inherently frightening to most people  and I wouldn t say Im an exception. but I dont find the unknown strictly scary. I actually take a level of comfort in it. even if I hypothetically could have all the answers right now  Im not sure I d want them. and honestly  I dont find the notion of eternal life very appealing.my priority at the moment is just trying to better my own life  treat others as I d want to be treated  make worthwhile memories and grab as many moments as I can. so  when Im on my deathbed  hopefully my brain will see all those moments play out again one last time and I can die with as few regrets as possible. whatever happens after that happens.  the dude abides. I do have faith in something higher greater than humanity  though I wouldn t say I pray to or worship deify it. itsimply doesnt take the same form or hold the same name as it might for others. if I had to describe it in one word  I d say that I have faith in  possibility . if you want to call that  God    truth    the cosmos    the universe  or something other  thats fine by me.
the part at the end doesnt make any sense to me. if God cant be in the presence of sin  why didn t he create the universe to be immune to it  moreover  why not just get rid of hell entirely  wouldn t thatsolve the problem
you thinking thatsatan exists  is like woke people thinking that preferred pronouns exist.
uh  ok. if the point was to show the similarity between  woke  ideology and religious dogma  mission accomplished
revelation 3 9behold  I will make them of the synagogue of satan  who say they are jews and are not  but do lie   behold  I will make them to come and worship at thy feet  and to know that I have loved thee. they call kanye crazy but they never call him a liar. kanye isn t talking about all jews  he is talking about the jews at the top of the hierarchical food chain. those who control entertainment  business  and legislative groups of america.epstein weinstein kotick ghislaine jamie dimon gates all jewish names and all hold or held a presence of power and wealth.
correct  its jewish
dont compare the gays to anton!
even if you weren t religious you would have to agree that to some extent back in the 1900s we didn t have this woke crap on going till now.
its ducking baal worship.
praise to Lord allah and his faithful son isa  Jesus ....our shephard. if you are gen z reading this remember one thing. dont follow shaytan. no matter what.
just so you know  you cannot use scripture to prove a point to someone who doesnt believe the Bible...
Im not religious  but I already have pondered about it being  evil .so  politics are anyways. its a question of asking them how do they feel about being evildoers.dont tell me they say Jesus was an opresor too its good to know your generation has people like you. good essay!now what  you are the bad girl because you are saying they are diabolique cheers!
no Imeant exactly what I said. woke ideology is satanic. its not  like  satanism. it is satanic  period.
@guardiansoulblade  well thank God for Christ. because without him  we d all be in a mess. there are more sins in the world than simply homosexuality. which is why Christ. and he is there for us all. romans 3 22  22 the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe. for there is no distinction  for all who believe  not just  some.  there is nothing to fear in the woke b.s. it only has as much power as you give it. and that will only hold weight in your eyes  but not for everyone
you cant have free will without someone introducing sin. it ll be defeated  but like dr strange is able to see every possibility  this was the one that ends with God having children he can love and be loved by in a real way and not forced
w
I told you I was a Christian and you told me Im not. I dont appreciate that. I know what I am.
I prefer satanists over woke people lol  they re a lot more fun. so yeah  dont think its a good analogy haha.
for one more example -chilling adventures of sabrina  show is filled with woke idiology and with sex scenes including gay  lesbians. the show is purely satanic and beyond  specifically targeted towards teenage girls.
100  correct. there s nothing good about this at all
I believe in God and Jesus but putting religion this hard into anything just turns me off.
thought satanist and satanic cultists were two different things   someone clarify to a atheist.
I agree with everything you say but keep this God person and religion out of it
how to admit you know nothing about satanism without just saying you know nothing about satanisim...
you do know that homosexual relationships are very common in nature we human beings are animals you know that right
catholic church brought you the Bible.. her members are corrupted  but she is not.
people dont burn in hell just for being gay or bi. Imean thats ridiculous. I dont like this  do everything in life this exact way or go to hell  stuff. it turns a lot of people away from Christianity. Im Christian but I dont believe in sneezing the wrong way and going to hell.
you talk about satan but have a tattoo of  a satanic symbol or idol on your arm of molock. lol
this infers that all muslims and jews will go to hell. I believe that wokeness is an anti-religion. but dont cast us out. you even cast out the israelites you talk about.
she s right.
at least 128 satanists and assorted groomers are very mad at this video.keep it up!
how are we born into sin when Jesus died and saved everyone if you inherited sin by default then you inherited the redemption by default you cannot say people are forgiven and at the same time say they are born into sin because it is forgiven right   we dont have free will we have a choice to either follow God or burn in hell which is not a choice.it is not free will. it is extortion.
pronouns   sorry dont play childish games
youre crazy.
look up Christopher hitchens. get smarter.
I said people who dont believe in the Bible aren t Christians  so if that makes you mad then idk what to say lol. thats like a carnivore saying they re vegan.
@melonie mac go boom  I believe in Jesus Christ  therefore Im Christian
@melonie mac go boom  you could tell me  God bless you  or something. that would be nice.
yup  I used to love thatshow  been a fan since the original when I was a kid and I was really into season 1 of the new spinoff   but there s no way I could in good conscience watch it now
@melonie mac go boom  if you watch the current one its too much for an adult..let alone mind of a child
satan is the driving force behind it - it is all connected
@melonie mac go boom  my pov is everybody wants you on their super highway. I was never converted into a atheist I sort of chose this path however  I dont see Christianity as a bad thing since over time it has evolved. the woke cult would definitely be more attracted to the ideas of communism and being gay because  its not only a cool thing to do its  organized rebellion  choosing to adopt a religion like satanism isn t too far a stretch from that. in short I liked this video just another piece to the puzzle.
God s word is truth. you are not a Christian if you do not believe in the word of God
@melonie mac go boom  I am a Christian.
we cannot be forgiven unless we accept Jesus  sacrifice and ask to be forgiven
@chief sitting feather  we z fake indigenous!!   its just common sense  dont be afraid of knowledge
all religions are corrupt  not just catholic.
God does not want people to practice homosexuality.
I do not agree that God the father cannot be in the presence of sin. he is with you as a Christian even when you sin by mistake. God can forgive your sin. sin has no power over God  God is not scared of sin. no what I believe more is thatsin cannot enter heaven because it will corrupt heaven as it has corrupted earth  if you have not asked for forgiveness of sin through Jesus Christ then you cannot enter heaven with thatsin still attached to you because you will turn heaven into just another earth.think of it like this. it is a rainy day outside and you are a child  you go out there and you have the time of your life  playing in the muddy puddles and getting all wet and mucky. eventually dusk begins to fall and your mother calls out to you  come on honey  Ive run a bath for you. come get cleaned up and ready for dinner . but you are having too much fun   no!  you yell   I want to keep playing! I dont want to get cleaned! . your mother of course replies  well you cant come indoors with all that mud on you  you ll get mud everywhere! all over the furniture and the walls and the floor. you ll get mud all over your siblings. come and take a bath and get cleaned up.  but yourefuse once more. eventually night will fall and you will be cold and scared..the night will eventually fall on humanity and the door to heaven will be shut. you cannot enter heaven as a mucky child. Jesus has spilled his pure blood to cleanse us so that we may enter heaven. God can be in the presence of sin. but he is not willing that heaven be corrupt as the earth is by letting those who refuse to come out of their sin to enter  otherwise heaven will fall as the earth has.
ethics over empathy.the Bible  one of the oldest self help book known to man.
a 33 min and 16 second video just to say nothing
nice video contrasting Christianity with the woke religion.
I dont like woke stuff  but I cant listen to that voice  sorry.
bruh !  what are you doing   when you speak of the Bible youre supposed to oonly play the hits!  youre not supposed to have this depth and this exposure to the hard stuff!!!!!!!!!!
if this satan person is this God s person enemy and God is all powerful when he just makes satan you know not exist anymore you Christians never explain this is he all-powerful or is he not!!!!!!
no... not a religion video...
as an atheist...  satanists get a bad rap...should look up the satanic tenets and the satanic rules of the earth
lmao imagine believing in God in 2022 2023
what about tattoos  is dat not cool  and if yes why havent you got yours removed
all right excuse the writing Im talking into a phone. the Bible that youre quoting from is not a kjv and because of that the context of the verses aren t entirely accurate the rulers of the darkness of this world the darkness that paul is speaking about in the context of the verse is false doctrine because in those verses paul is talking about those who are preaching another Jesus they re preaching another God and they re preaching false doctrine today 99.9  of so-called Christians are preaching works as a means for salvation preaching that you have to walk and talk and act and be a certain way in order to get salvation and if you dont youre not really saved. this is evil because according to the gospel salvation is by grace through faith without works now what many people do is they ll go to the book of james or to matthew mark luke and john and try to attack salvation by grace through faith alone but what they re doing when they do that is they re ignoring doctrine in matthew mark luke and john Christ was a minister of the circumcision he came to confirm promises to the jews my people in time past  but the jews denied Jesus as the messiah and murdered him then in luke 13 7-9 God gave israel a one-year extension of mercy now parables in scripture are not just saying  according to matthew 13 10 a parable is designed to make itso those who are believers can understand it but those who are not believers will not believe itso a parable is not antithetical its not something that is fictional its very much real. according to the context so without a side in luke 13 7-9 God gives israel a one-year extension of mercy to get their house in order to come back to God willingly but the end of the one year extension of mercy ends with the stoning of stephen now in acts 1 there are many stupid people out there again Im not trying to be mean the term stupid means one lacking knowledge or common sense stupid so when I use these words there s context behind them Im not just trying to be mean  but stupid people who lack knowledge and common sense dont realize that in luke 13 7 through 9 God gave israel a one-year extension of mercy after the one-year extension to israel was over at the stoning of stephen salvation was then given to the gentiles for to provoke the jews to jealousy they were cast off the Bible says that God divorced israel and according to the old testament law divorce was allowed if the person in the marriage was unfaithful and God refers to israel as a harlot who hath committed whoredom with the false Gods of this world and so he strips her naked and casts her off into the wilderness this is what she is when Christ comes back to her offering her the kingdom trying to get israel to return willingly but israel being a w   not wanting to listen kills Christ then God gives her a one-year extension then they murder steven and so peter s group is scattered and Jesus only spoke to the jews in matthew mark luke and john because at the time of matthew mark luke and john the gentiles were aliens from the commonwealth of israel they were dogs the only time God blessed a gentile in matthew mark luke and john was when they humbled themselves to the jew according to the mosaic law which is exactly what happened the centurion the lady who approached Jesus all of these people who came to Jesus who were gentiles did something for israel the centurion built them a synagogue the lady who approached Jesus begging for his help humbled herself as a gentile and said even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters table oh woman great is your faith  on top of this hebrews 9 tells you you cant have a new testament without the death of the test day tour for a testament is a force after men are dead otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth  you cant have a new testament until after Christ s death but the new testament didn t start right after his death because there was a one-year extension of mercy so after the one year extension of mercy which was about mid-ax is when the body of Christ started before that it was the kingdom church and the doctrine of the kingdom church was to believe Jesus is the messiah believe on him and keep the commandments according to what Jesus commanded and they will be welcomed into the kingdom when it comes  but they didn t come back to God willingly as a nation  because of this israel was cast out peter s group was scattered this is why in james chapter 1 james a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ to the 12 tribes which are scattered abroad the 12 tribes is referring to those who were scattered at the persecution that arose about steven and luke 13 7-9  after peter s group was scattered they only preached to jews  it wasn t until God has sent peter a vision saying not to think of anyone as uncommon or unclean when the italian band came to peter s house peter says its an unlawful thing for a jew to come unto one of another nation so it was unlawful it was against the old testament law but at this point the old testament law had been dealt with through Christ and the dispensation of grace had started because of israel s fall  so the doctrine was changing we re going through a transition. in the book of acts from israel to the body of Christ from the kingdom church to the body of Christ this is why paul says that my gospel in the preaching of Jesus Christ according to the revelation of the mystery which was kept secret since the world began thats what paul tells you but peter says that peter s gospel was known since the world began because peter was preaching according to prophecy but paul was preaching according to the revelation of the mystery which was kept secret since the world began ephesians 3  so not to take so long here but its incredibly important youre reading from a kjv because all other Bibles are preaching from alexandrian manuscripts which are pagan  so you need a kjv its the only one thats pure now yes the doctrines being taught today are evil but you canthink these religious people who are doing this to people nowadays you have so many right-wing households forcing religion on their children to such unholy levels that you have these kids that are raised in households who have kleinfelters which is a chromosomal abnormality which affects their sexuality you have people who are literally born gay and they re taught to hate themselves and then on top of that being taught that they have to walk and talk and act a certain way or else they re going to lose their salvation which is not biblical for today because paul s gospel is by grace through faith alone is how youre safe today but 99.9  of so-called churches today preacher false doctrine because they re preaching that you have to walk and talk and act a certain way to be saved they re ignoring the fact that there s been a dispensational change in scripture according to doctrine so when you quote the book of ephesians you have to understand there s doctrine here and 99.9  of so-called Christian groups today deny paul deny his apostleship or they ll outright say that what paul was preaching is the same as what Jesus was preaching which is a total contradiction to what the scripture says because all of the Bible is for your knowledge for your growth for your learning but its all not directly talking to you today all right we re not following the more than 600 laws my people the jews had to follow today youre not following sabbath today and if you put yourself under the sabbath then according to old testament law you have to then kill those who violate sabbath so you cant follow it but there are idiots stupid people who have no idea what they re doing they re just following a religious system and when they put their children under that religious system and these kids cant follow it because it wasn t meant for them to follow it creates what you see today. religious people are creating this stuff  every overly religious right-wing person in the country is creating the very enemy they re trying to stop they re creating twice as much a son of hell as themselves  and the inability of the right winger the inability of the religious person mostly is the fact they re so overly religious and they dont rightly divide according to 2nd timothy 2 15 you can really divide the word of truth you can also wrongly divide the word of truth and the biggest issue today is the illiteracy when it comes to doctrine people are illiterate sad but true they re totally illiterate when it comes to the Bible. and it really gets old sorry for the long post there s a lot to go over here
I think ur a babe and a 100  w women. most girls now days blindly follow shaytan!! glad to see you are choosing allah over all these woke ideologies. btw when u choose Jesus you also choose allah because nobody comes to the father except thru the son.
woke ideology is not a religion and is not satanic
this has got to be satire.
hail satan
as a follower of Jesus Christ myself I am not against people whom are so called  woke  in your opinion
can someone please tell me what the hell woke means because that word gets used too much
I said satan corrupts seemingly good things like the catholic church  how you got  only the catholic church is corrupt  out of that is puzzling
@melonie mac go boom  well Ive been watching your vids and the only time you mention corruption is with the catholic church  thats where I got that from. other than that my opinion still stands  all religions are corrupt and I will continue to enjoy your videos.
she said plenty and showed a lot of receipts.
@morb 357  if God doesnt kill his children and we re all children of God how do you explain the great flood and sodom and gomorrah
nothing in the Bible against tattoos specifically  people quote leviticus ceremonial law regarding a pagan scarification practice that the verse right above itsays not to cut the sides of your hair or shave your beard  but people love taking the Bible out of context. regarding tattoo removal  obviously you dont know how that works. it would be impossible for me to remove this whole sleeve  I could get it faded and splotchy at most  so no thanks lol. tattoo removal is meant for small tattoos  doesnt remove huge pieces effectively. not that I would want to remove my tattoos anyway.
look it up.
it used to mean being aware of other people and their problems but now  imo  its about hating anyone who thinks different than you.
the moment you mixed religion in all this shit you lost me. we had a good run.
oh boy! another youtuber turns out to be loony-bin Christian
melonie  I like your podcasts but that thing about catholic church you said was such an straw man  so if there are some corrupt persons that can by itself dismisses a church  that can be applied to protestantism too the same way  cause there are a lot of corrupt pastors and persons in protestantism  so I think that was such an unjust generalization and false argument to use in order to supposedly invalid the catholic church. please lets stay true and avoid false arguments and deceptions in our thoughts. God bless you.
what did Jesus do for you besides the idea of Jesus  if Im going to put faith in someone to do something  thatsome one better be alive.
as a gay cuban immigrant who received citizenship in the us through military service in the us army and a disabled veteran I have to agree that the woke ideology is evil.I do not support the pronoun bs  I do not support censorship  I do not believe nor support the ideology the us is ran by white supremacy nor that white privilege exists in the us today  see my vid white privilege on my channel . we need to protect children from the woke  gender ideology and prevent children from under going gender reassignment surgery. I was born in cuba and lived through the cuban revolution under castro. what you have with sjw is exactly what took place in cuba for castro to seize power. they stopped teaching higher learning in schools and focused on sjw issues. this fostered stupid generations who were easily manipulated into committing violence  civil war . castro tried to get voted into power and failed  so he manipulated the masses to over through the gov and now the cuban people live in poverty  under complete gov control  etc.the fault in arguing anything with the Bible as your reference sources is the following 1. the Bible was not written by Jesus  the Bible was written by the church. based on the witness accounts of the apostles. the church excluded several books from the Bible as they did not fit the narrative of the church  the book of mary for example  which was excluded because it was an account given by a woman .point being  you are not getting the full story  just select parts.2. then you must take in account the continuous changes in the text  the Bible that continuously changes to fit the narrative of the churches current views . example  the Bible has always recognized homosexuality as an abomination  no doubt everyone who reads this and is a  Christian  is nodding their head in agreement and professing gay is not the way . yet completely ignoring the fact that all sin is an abomination in God s eyes  according to the Bible.geneva  1st Bible ever written  and kjv  1st Bible put in numerical order  both illustrate all sins as abominations. proverbs  6 16-19 in which its illustrates these sins are abominations.then when you look at newer Bibles like the niv Bible with the same verse proverbs 6 -16-19 they change the text to say detestable instead of abomination. this change sets a degree of sin  meaning it makes the argument that homosexuality is a far more egregious sin than lying  cheating  lust  murder  etc.yet there is no degree in sin  one sin is not worse than another. yet the argument can be made that there are sins that are worse as you have the 10 commandments. those being God s top  do not do  list. murder is there  adultery  lying... but homosexuality is not.so those who wish to argue a degree exists  it doesnt favor the anti-gay argument. yet I reiterate there is no degree of sin  one is not worse than another. yes homosexuality according to the Bible is a sin  so is lust  lying  etc.all sin is forgivable  Christ gave his own earthly life and body in sacrifice for our sins. then let s be honest about heaven and how to get in. the Bible states that 144 000  rev 7 4 if memory serves  will be covered under the seal. the Bible also states that the path to heaven is narrow and few shall enter.millions of people say they are Christian catholic jews etc. yet only 144 000 will enter. we all commitsin no one is better than another. Jesus preached to and cared for societies undesirables. murderers  thieves  those of disease  prostitutes  etc. the argument against the woke needs to be absent of  the Bible says so  when the Bible has been changed time and time again.the argument needs to be made on mortality and morality alone. is it moral to flaunt sexuality  no  regardless if its gay strait etc. is it moral to allow a child to choose gender surgery identity etc  nomorality needs to be installed back into society  not arguments based on flawed foundations  like arguing religion   yes the Bible makes moral arguments  has a good foundation in how to live  yet is extremely flawed as reference material as it has been changed again and again.if youread the Bible read the geneva or kjv  anything after those has been a washed down warped version  with continuous changes in text to suit whatever church printed it.this is not an attack on the Bible quran torah habbash etc. I find the text in all these religious materials beautiful and poetic as well as historical. I have my phd in psychology and ma in theology. if you want to fight the woke  do it based solely on morality  protection of youth and nuclear family. loved the vid melonie  I do enjoy seeing people willing to stand up for their beliefs and convictions  even if its a religious one. fight against the woke  censorship and those who wish to do future generations harm.happy holidays all  I wish you all the best.
melonie mac the danger of what your doing is you riskbecoming the theocratic mirror image of the extreme left.please educate yourself on far right extremism as well asfar left extremism or you risk turning into someone very uglyand cruel!you are right the extreme left is a kind of cult religion but socan extreme theocracy be as well just educate yourself aboutworld history something the woke mob does not do rightwing religion has always had a  wrath of the righteous problem please do not fall prey to that mindset! cast the first stone ...............I have not liked disliked this vid as a secular humanistI believe you have a right to practise your faith in private life.thank you.
classic religious move  demonise people you disagree not surprised I liked you better when you just talked about tomb raider
lol Im not worried about her  she s legitimately a good person with a big heart. youre a bit ridiculous for thinking she will somehow turn into a nick fuentes fundamentalist or crusader.Imean I dont know her personally  maybe she would be in favor of Christian nationalism  no longer separating church and state . that would be bad but from what I hear from her she sounds fairly libertarian and not authoritarian at all.
Im barely right of center in the first place  this is not gonna happen lol
@vulcan h  we will be keeping an eye on to be a freethinking sentinel!
@melonie mac go boom  we shall see but talk of demons scripture prophecy etc makes me wary.church and state should remain seperate
she provided many examples of how it directly goes against what the Bible teaches  she didn t just say  I no like  must be satan . she also didn t demonize the people  she demonized the  movement. did you even watch the video or did you just see the title and assume from there
