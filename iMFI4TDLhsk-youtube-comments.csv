of course he s lying.
gunn told cena not to read source material for peacemaker  that tells you about how much he cares about authenticity between comics and movies
this is what separates james gunn from henry cavill. james doesnt want to deal with the fans having issues. henry  on the other hand  feels that fans are passionate about the characters and stories and dont think they are a pain in the a@@.
fans can be uproarious and unkind...thats the nicest way Ive seen someone in hollywood call all of us toxic
several of  those actors were great.  gal  gadot was good as wonder woman  henry cavill is superman  and jason was great as aquaman.  the problem was not with the actors  it was with the storylines they were given.
he will keep suicide squad and peacemaker cast  because that the one he did. he will just remove the ones people like hahaha
woke media is gonna do anything to get their way to project their message they dont care about a fans moral companionship to a story and staying true to something. love your videos and your message at the end. hope all is well! God bless
having young superman all the time has been seen time and time again  it would be so much better if we get a more mature experienced superman
thanx for sharing your faith.  as a fellow believer  I admire your willingness to give an answer for what you believe in.
zachary levI and henry cavill are the hardest blows from this. both of them are great as their characters   henry just needed a better script imo.
the fact is cavill  galdot  afleck and momoa worked very well together. I also liked ray fisher and I think cyborg was very restricted.
wow! this is the first time other than gal and mamoa where I found people so dedicated to these actors for these roles.  last few years Ive heard the opposite
its not that they are too old  right now . Im assuming gunn has plans for the dc universe that ll span over a good amount of time. I think anybody who wants a more cohesive and consistent story would make the same decision.
so. close. to. 100k. keep going  melonie!also perplexes me that they make this big mega-push for henry cavill to be superman in black adam  and then drop him to absolutely zero. what the...
the clear lack of scruples or understanding they have for what the fans want  is astounding.
this is why james gunn is getting 70 000 lbs of coal in his stocking
gal gadot and henry cavill both are class acts  and it figures they re both getting the ax. the dcu is its own worst enemy  just like disney marvel is its own worst enemy  and as you mentioned  the fact that they are focusing on  activism  as opposed to writing anything good that will appeal to the fans is what s killing them. they are willfully ignoring this fact  too. what gunn calls  disrespectful outcry  is simply him not being able to handle fans being passionate and calling him among others out on their lack of respect for canon. and thank you for the message at the end  this aspiring Christian appreciated it and found it timely and appropriate.
I didn t even enjoy man of steel very much  fell asleep in the theater   but I would have gone to see henry cavill as superman again because he is the best actor for the role. I ll also be going to see shazam 2 because zachary levI is my favorite actor and an all around lovely person  and I really hope they dont recast him. though he may be dodging a bullet if they do
merry Christmas week always beautiful melonie!!! I do agree with you that gunn is lying and a bit of hypocrisy when it comes to casting. I did like zazlav at first when he got rid of woke batgirl movie. and then he decides to recast everyone because of the patty jenkins issue which isnt fair to the other actors except ezra miller. sometimes I wish that they made these announcements at the end of next year before the dceu officially died and then I would have be alright with that. I especially dont like the cutting of cavill and gadot on the flash movie instead of giving them a last hurrah before they go.
I absolutely love that end message!!!
yeah james gunn is lying
he hasn t lied yet so why would he now .
@anthony cheesman  he s only hope is that he is lying they will destroy his guardians of the galaxy 3 without even thinking you so happened to james cameron recently yeah people love avatar 2 but in reality failed bombed at the box office
@anthony cheesman  he lied about warlock being casted for guardians 3   honestly I dont blame him he s doing what anyone in that position should do. Im really hopeful for dc on the big screen   and yes someone can play aquaman other than mamoa there is a way more definitive version to put on the screen   momoa is a no brainer as lobo. I really dont understand people complaining about this right now because this universe is about 6 years overdue for a reboot.
@brandon cetta  really now youreaching lol.
liar liar james gunn on fire
@anthony cheesman  reaching on what
@brandon cetta  him lying about adam really lol.
which is oddly similar to bryan singer on the first x-men movie. then kevin feige  who was about 26 at the time  snuck the comics on set anyway so the actors could learn more about their roles and it def helped and look where kevin is now at 49 yrs old even though mcu has gone to shit after endgame...so itshows gunn and singer didnt dont care what the fans want  they care what they want which is typical hollywood hubris. its why I couldnt never get into anderson s re movies or michael bays transformers movies. same situation.
cena s portrayal is infinitely more entertaining than the source material so it kinda worked out for the best
@bumblebee  even still its an obcurre character so most people dont know or care. but when you are now in the lead to do the same thing with well known iconic characters  eh....
you do know that james gunn himself does know these characters and used to read these comics dont you
@budgie cat  did he say he would do that in movies of well known characters  sorry but its too soon to be making assumptions at this point.the way Im seeing people has been making far too much many assumption using examples from the early dc movies  decisions made by a completely different wb leadership with a completely different mindset. which is foolish.
@bloody  so what  that doesnt change what I said
@bloody  its not really a baseless assumption when you can look back at this past work as evidence. and the fact he used shows and movies as his defining influences for this plan of his. he didnt name any comics. if he doesnt want people using comics source material thatshows his hubris in that he only cares for his vision aka fuck the comics which is why I brought up bryan singer cause he was the same way
@budgie cat  brian singer wasn t a cb reader  james gunn was. you can even see that in the resulting suicide squad movie. did he take some liberties  yes  did he respect many of the concepts explored I the comics  also yes. peacemaker is an extremely obscure dc character. even loyal dc comic book fans may not know who this characters is  thats how obscure he is.and thats why james gunn probably chose the character. he told john cena not to read the comics because he was planning on making changes from the very beginning. as proof  john cena was the only actor he asked not to read the comics. he didn t forbid anyone else. unlike brian singer.
@bloody  gunn completelty changed the characters in gotg cmon bruh. he only care for his vision. facts
@budgie cat  completely changed he characters... yeah  sure. because they weren t already changed before. he only character that was really changed was the weasel.all other characters still had heir traits.some merely becoming exaggerated versions of who they really are. which is the case of savant  a character which is pretty shallow in the comics  being a hero who becomes a villain. nanaue has many versions and his portrayal was in lie with the new 52 version of him. polka dot man is a literal improvement over who te character was in the comics  ratcatcher 2 is a totally new character successor of the original ratcatcher  who also barely had a background in the comics  being originally a literal rat-catcher turned bad. which once again is an improvement over who the character originally was. they even made use of the original character backstory to an extent. harley and boomerang are the same as the old one from the first attempt at an adaptation. rick flagg was changed in personality but he is essentially the same character in concept to that of te comic books.
is peacemaker an actual character... I thought they made him up for the movie lol
@bloody  wait... so mongal  and mongol  can fight superman but she gets wrecked by a helicopter
@caliginous moira  you mean the character that was only put there to fill the roster  and that would never realistically enter any version of a suicide squad as she was no criminal
yet peacemaker is a beloved show now lol maybe james is onto something. he made the guardians big is well  we live in an era that now properly know of peacemaker and vigilante lol
a tip then for james gunn  if you dont want to deal with fans having issues  keep your trap shut. you make a mess and then complain that the fans call you out on making that mess.
gunn needs to remember who buys tickets
gunn and henry need to know who s grifting off the drama.
@tj roelsma  the whole reason gunn was temporarily canceled a few years ago was because he couldnt keep his trap shut on social media and was arguing with some random right winger who then proceeded to get back at him by exposing his old tweets to point out him being a hypocrite.ironically enough  when gunn got reinstated  and when gina carano also got canceled on social media and by  disney  gunn replied laughing at her downfall.  side note  cavill used to date carano just sayin maybe theres something else there...   and this is also the reason gunn now auto deletes his tweets after some time so this doesnt happen again to him lol  even though one can still take a screenshotl the internet is forever as they say
henry understands fans and how we feel about canon  because he himself is a fan. on another thread  some sjw twit is basically calling me  wait for it  racist because I  among many others  called out the  witcher  series for its insisting on shoehorning token black people into every scene  and made a fool of him herself by assuming Ive never read the books. Ive read them all. I among others called this idjit out but hard for their foolishness because we are fans. we are passionate about our canon. itshowed  and the fool in question is still trying to fight us on it. go figure.
if that were true  he wouldn t reply to so many comments regarding it on twitter.
@budgie cat  you seem very sad.
@gavin aeilts  why would I be sad  your mom keeps me perfectly happy
hahah who cares if henry cavill is passionate and doesnt dislike the fans he simply cant act.
@dennis d  yeah  melonie mac.
@budgie cat  dont project.
@budgie cat  your projection doesnt stop henry cavill being a garbage actor nor does itstop melonie wack being a far right grifter.
@dragon ball fans cant read  youre projecting
@budgie cat  nah that d be you.
@dragon ball fans cant read  same reason youre watching her videos lol
@budgie cat  Im not watching her videos lmao.you tried.
@budgie cat  no  Im just here to expose this right wing neo fashy grifter that doesnt actually like comics  video games  lotr etc etc.
@dragon ball fans cant read  its Christmas dont you have better things to do like streak down your neighborhood vandalizing people s outdoor Christmas decorations in drag
@david robinson  tickets  merchendise and who creates all the buzz.
@tj roelsma  no  if you do not want to deal with fans you leave the entertainment industry or just do original stuff.
yeah henry cavil was pretty bad as superman  he s a good actor tho. but man  his fans are blind and biased
@moon knight  moon knight was trash
all true  but I think the damage was done. I like henry as much as the next  but if they want to right the ship  they need a complete recast to facilitate a clean break. not all that keen on another superman origin arc again though  gunn and dc are making another mistake going that route. not many people want to see superman learning his powers  learning how to journalism  or meeting lois. we ve seen that over and over again already . . . long past seeing superman at his peak. at the same time  you cant really throw supes against adversaries like darkseid without some buildup.
gal was bad  she s not a good actress and she s not a physical presence as ww
jason was terrible as aquaman  what are you smoking  dude was nothing like aquaman  didn t even look like him
henry cavil ain t superman  tom welling is  if cavil played ares . now thats a role he d suit not fuckin remus lupin
@moon knight  now now....Im a huge smallville fan and thats a big reason why I hate the dceu superman but tom was clark  not superman
@stankey poosea   he s more aquaman then cavil is superman
@strange faced   I hate him is well  I d say welling was a great superman. I d say welling  dean cain  and tyler hoelchin these are my superman. reeves ain t on the list because he ain t alive
@moon knight  reeves should be there regardless
@strange faced   I should ve left cain out  because Im thinking of men old enough to play supes. I personally would ve left cavil because he s already superman . by 2030 we ll have had more then 10 live action superman
people love peacemaker
@anthony barr  no  but thats james show
@anthony barr  people love john cena
do you actually know what woke means
james gunn makes fun of woke people in peacemaker like several times dude
@sushii   what does woke mean
@sushii  just because he isn t  woke  doesnt mean he isn t forced to fall victim to their ways when it comes to the stability of story telling especially when money is involved. people will bend like hot iron to gain a buck and if you have the woke masses complaining it makes it harder to stick to your guns.
@stankey poosea   idk why you d say that about the antI white thing  you dont know me fam. and its momoa  momoa as aquaman is where its at. he just needs to be abit more better written
@moon knight  except his whole movie was  white people bad  brown people good . even the marketing interviews were all about how it was specifically about racist white people. it wasn t good enough for them that aquaman is already focused on surface dwellers vs ocean dwellers  they literally had to make it about skin color. the only reason mamoa was cast is because he s brown. they literally had the blonde oceanmaster calling him halfbreed and then mamoa beating him up. what kind of message does this send to young white kids  I am tired of ignoring the anti-white agenda  I am tired of ignoring the  brown washing  of white characters. if youre okay with aquaman being brown then you better not say a word if a character like t chala or blade being cast with a white actor.
@rob  the build-up is already there. its called zack snyder s justice league.
@stankey poosea   did you know aquaman like namor was ridiculed growing up because they are bald breeds. literally both half atlanteans  just different universes. Im only okay with aquaman being polynesian because it legit fits  yes momoa needs to brush up his acting by abit. and Im not one to say change there ethnicity but thatshit fits.   so I dont think you ve given a quick look at aquamans comics because for a time he literally was an outcast . like the xmen.  and no lol tchalla being white wouldn t fit his character  nor would blade. Im just saying once in a blue moon when a character is changed race wise and it legit works then hell yeah I d agree to that. jason momoa is half white half hawaiian tho yeah he looks mixed which is obvious he s giving aquaman a pretty good name. now the mcu casting namor as a mesoamericanthat is lame because that feels forced on marvels end.
thats what Ive been saying its the script of the movie thats the problem!   thats why I win the schneider cut came out everyone was like why wasn t this done in the first place        the second wonder woman wasn t trash but it wasn t as good as the first and the rest of the cast not so good.    but wonder woman as a whole I dont think should have been a movie but itshould have been a series.not one of these short six to eight episodes.      more in the traditional form of 23 episodes in a year that would have given the writers more time  to see their villain story arc is wrong and rewrite it.     couldn t really watch the batman movie I just kind of lost interest.      because Ive seen batman restart too many damn times.     while batman is consistent its the same retelling of the same old same old.but then when we like something thats old.    here comes dumb dumb hollywood we re going to redo it .    warner brothers wants the success of the marvel universe so bad that they cant see they re already there.      and they care about the fans so little but crave the money  that these donkeys and I shouldn t disparage the donkey.         will spend just as much money if not more in time years to recast and reboot every justice league character.
exactly the script and storyline was very weak that didn t do the characters well
@rob  not really. wb already proved your theory wrong with superman   lois. tyler hoachlin and elizabeth tulloch  lois  both debuted on the awful cw supergirl show and they were terrible in it because of the shit writing and direction.then hbo max made superman   lois which at first was going to be a spinoff  but cw supergirl and the latter ned of arrowverse was so bad they completely distanced the show from them  just reusing tylyer  elizabeth  and the actress that played lois sister  lana lane  on supergirl. and as a result  because superman   lois had completely different writers and directors  and a better budget  the show was way better than the cw stuff  and the acting by tyler and elizabeth were 100  improved  and  no one held the show down because of the terrible cw past.so it can be done but the reason it isnt done is the same reason kevin feige doesnt accept netflic abc hulu marvel shows as canon. becaue he didnt make it.so gunn is the same way. he dont want to adopt other actors for his new vision unless said actors are ones he s used before. its his ego.
@moon knight  lmao welling is way too old and fat to be considered to be superman. even brandon routh is a better choice. he still looked good in that cw cameo crossover while tom looked terrible
@moon knight  everyone knows he d be a better lobo cmon.
@stankey poosea  in she-hulk they raceswapped the first three members of the wrecking crew who arewhite to two latinos and an asian and they raceswapped elliot franklin aka thunderball  the smartest of the wrecking crew  who s supposed to be a genius physicist  to a white guy as he was black in the comics.they thought people wouldnt notice but we did lol.people were fancasting thunderball for years to be played by either terry crews  aldis hodge  hawkman in black adam   or michael jae white  dark knight  spawn
@moon knight  it also broke canon because atlantis was already shown in iron man 2
@budgie cat  thats really dumb. I dont know why they cant stick to the comics. they keep race swapping characters and changing everything to the point where it can barely be recognizable as the original character.
nothing at all wrong with snyder s original story lines. the  snyderverse is a masterpiece.  it will stand the test of time.
we all know how james gunn feels about young boys. thats why he wants to reboot the dceu with young heroes.
no! you dont get to see positive portrayals of masculinity in our films.
levI isn t gone though.
cavill and dwayne johnsson has the same agent  dwaynes wife. rumor is that they fought hard for the cameo that included cavill.
or live grenades without pins
@colin morgan  that too
@b.c. aka the new dark eclipse  how much would that be in tons
we ll have to agree to disagree about jason mamoa. he doesnt play aquaman. he plays himself  but with aquaman s powers. aquaman would never say   myy mannn!  and surf on a para-demon.
best. video. moment. at 14 40!and thats why I subscribed to your channel in the first place    keep doing the wonderful work youre doing  melonie! merry Christmas to you  miss mac!God bless you all the way!go boom!
we re not recasting everyone  just supermanbatmanwonder womanaquamanand the flashbut hey! we re keeping viola davis and that one chick from the suicide squad! remember them!
thank you for this video  fans are real people.
thanks for that message at the end  really needed to hear that  keep up the good work. stay safe
you are really close to 100k. you deserve it
am I the only one that loves grant gustin s portrayal of barry allen on the series   I cant imagine he d turn down the role  and Im also fairly sure he s never kidnapped children.
Ive been through too many continuity reboots to be upset at this point. this is just how these media companies work  insert depressed resignation to the situation . my rule is I wait to see how the next continuity turns out  and I decide if its at least as good as the first or good in a different way. then I ll really complain if it isn t. because not only will they have killed something I liked  but they wasted my time with the replacement. right now  we re watching a cool downtown building being demolished. the building that goes up in its place had better be spectacular.
do you feel if you were told thatsarah silverman was going to play lara croft    thats how I feel about momoa playing aquaman
if they do go through with recasting  it ll be origin stories again and this time their version of  origin  story with actors that fit that mold  the line must be drawn here. gadot  momoa  and cavill were some of best casting choices for their roles  its rare to see that in hollywood today.
watching you on flashcast was so funny youre too pure
I would be interested in see some fan concepts in which they show their ideal version of characters.
the more news that comes out from him  the more he seems to not care about fans as he claims to. he said he was gonna continue what worked and fix what didn t but here he is getting rid of a lot of the things that worked. and I guess to him  his addition is just too good to drop with everything else. the suicide squad cast never felt irreplaceable as their characters except sylvester stallone. but henry cavill and zachary levI  absolutely deserve to stay because they fit their roles way too perfectly
great video melonie. it was really good to see you on midnights edge tf. you look amazing. love ya mel. take care and enjoy your night
while I think that jason momoa is far better suited as lobo than aquaman  I agree that he s going to be a hard act to follow in the latter role. Im wondering if aquaman 2 is planned to be the last solo movie because  let s face it  there s only so many underwater stories that you cantell. I think they ll use him to try to usher in superreplacement.
all right a new video. I ll have to finish it after midnights edge. but here for it
this connects well with the stream you just did. but its crazy to think they want to fire almost half of the cast. I really hope they dont do the g4y superman.
what I dont understand is if robert pattinson s batman can have its own timeline and universe and continue on why cant they just do that with henry cavill s superman ! !
Im surprised youre talking about the other people and not just cavil. because itseems like no one else cares about the other people being replaced except cavil.at least we ll see whats left of the members from the suicide squad and what they re doing!
hey melonie!! lovin the look today. I ll have to come back to watch after the stream though!
exactly! its like watching the rock in anything  its always just the rock in a costume but he acts the exact same way
agreed. Ive been a momoa fan since baywatch hawaiI  but that doesnt make him the right actor for aquaman.
well  the superheroes in mcu dont exactly talk like their comic book counterparts either.
that is true  but honestly I feel like he suits true role tho I would write him a lot different to how he portrays arthur. I didn t like aquaman  the movie as I saw barely anything maorI hawaiian  you dont waste tem morrison and momoa in a fuckin movie like that
for his aquaman iteration  aquaman would say that.
lol momoa made aquaman awesome.stop lying.
@preludedraw momoa is based on rebirths comic canon.
sort of felt like some versions of namor  which may have been the point of the casting.
@kenneth smith  no. momoa is based on rebirths comic version of aquaman.a beard and a quindent.he s supposed to look like the greek God poseidon.
@goodnesswhy  whataboutisms aren t gonna help you bro. the point still stands.
I dont see too many issues with mamoa outside the blonde blue eye arthurian version not really working.  his version seems self consistent which is all I ever really care about with comics adaptations.book adaptations I do care about  but with comics I expect reboots and au s will happen.
at least momoa look more aquaman and still an atlantean than the taskmaster in the msheu or namorrrr aka  a cockoo can .
finally someone gets it. aquaman was bred to be a king. he s a strategist. and yet mera calls him stupid at least 3 times during the film. and how the hell did he get tattoos when he cantake an rpg to the chest
@frank zanca thats practically a nit pick quite honestly.even kriptonian skin can be tampered with. atlantean was never a kriptonian and can bleed with certain materials. the tattoo can be explained but thats too irrelevant for the plot honestly. also this is an origin story  he even shown more capabilities than mera can even if she s not fond of him as the plot already explained why she s like that to him. this is no msheu men bad and incompetent but women great and no mistake whatsoever.
true
@michael lane  arthur literally has no personality. he s a boring person.momoa is the complete opposite. thats not an adaption  thats not being able to act.
the version from batman  the brave and the bold would.
@natsohigh !  ehat version are you talking about. watch batman  the brave and the bold. aquaman is hilarious and a badass.
@natsohigh !  not sure why youresponding to me  Imeant arthurian legend was not the backstory match for his aquaman.
@speedy  you searched the entire history of aquaman and found one similar version from an appearance on an unpopular batman cartoon. against your  proof  I present all of his other appearances in comics  animated series  and video games.
@rlh125  no.I dont need to look stuff up  I have a decent comic memory. Im getting old  forgetting things. I said. that version  in thatshow  suggesting maybe  he used that as reference. I watched it as a kid along with others. read a his comics in the eighties. my favourite is when he lost his hand. my only issue with mamoa  he wasnt blonde.
@speedy   outragious!  thats the version I grew up with and made me a fan of the character. I dont mind mamao s version. but if given the option  I ll choose swashbuckling  hero-king   who s always ready to kick some ass  that brave and the bold gave us  every damn time.
@jhon maverick  agreed. thats the version I wanted. watching him annoy batman would have been hilarious.
@norman readdis  that  namorinnameonly  shoulda just been a new original character if he s the avatar of kukukhan  who was shown in zeus pantheon of Gods in thor love   thunder  sitting next to the wakandan Goddess bast  who is the sister of the God konchu  who has moon knight as his avatar   and he was wearing the same headdress and body ornamients namorinnameonly was wearing  plus he had bluiesh green skin .because in iron man 2  atlantis was actually shown on the map off the southern west coast of africa in the atlantic ocean  with said map also showing wakanda s location .and  in the comics  poseidon also exists so they coulda done that too.but nope  mcu wanted to put in their diversity checkbox inclusion to go after the  latinx  crown lol
@budgie cat sadly its because of licensing issues. because universal still had the rights to its movies. imagine if universal go forth onn luke evans namor  that ll be a slap in the face for marvel dissknee lol.
@norman readdis  universal cant make a namor movie on their own without marvel though  so a luke evans universal namor wouldnt happen. truth be told  disney is too greedy and stingy to do it with universal same reason we never got a hulk movie after disney bought marvel. because universal . but thatsaid  universal and marvel studios  before disney bought marvel  had 9 years to make a namor movie before disney got on the scene but never did. they probably thought it wouldnt sell which begs the question why buy the rights in the first place then.
@speedy  my point wasn t so much that you went desperately searching for a mamoa-like aquaman. that isn t really what I thought happened and I probably should have phrased it better. my point was that the b b aquaman was completely different from every other aquaman depiction. its possible thatsnyder cast mamoa because he was like that depiction  but its more likely that he cast him because  other than hair color  he looks like the long-haired aquaman. and mamoa just acts like himself
yes they can  they have the movie rights. like sony with spiderman. they re just keeping the license for now.
@norman readdis  no they cant. kevin feige talked about it a couple years ago. its not the same situation like sony. its more like a half   half thing. disney cant make a namor movie without universal s involvment and unversal cant make a namor movie without marvel  s involvement.
all characters recast as black or gay or black and gay trans or gender swapped. insert black gay superman  non binary wonderman etc
considering the whole dceu  only wonder woman seems to act the way she does in the comics.  I agree mamoa plays himself  but didn t really mind it.  if they are starting over  id like to see a more classic take on aquaman.
@fun in the sun  I think part of the reasoning perhaps with that was that aquaman had for a long time been seen as a joke character thanks to the memes from the 70s super friends show of his surfing on dolphins  to spongebob making a joke character based off him  to the tv series entourage doing a whole long running joke segment of the main character  who was an actor  getting the role of aquaman directed by james cameron  which in theory is still oddly a great idea lol so in order to deviate from that impression  they prob felt going with momoa was the best choice at the time.but many say momoa would be better served as lobo to which james gunn didnt tweet back in denial  but I do wonder  would a lobo movie actually sell well.then again honestly im still surprised aquaman made a billion dollars. it didnt have the luxury of being shoehorned in between two of the most anticipated movies in history  infinity war   endgame  like the mundane captain marvel movie was
@goodnesswhy  thats because the mcu is an abomination. people loved it because people love to say they favor marvel over dc  but in reality most people only like care about spider-man and x-men  so people didn t mind any of the changes.me  I hated every single change on thor  curiously enough the first movie that everyone dislikes  is the only thorn movie I tolerate  because its the only one thatsomeone resembles who the character is.
@frank zanca  magic  and its not controversial either  because there are magic systems based on tattoos and body paint.
@bloody  there is nothing in the aquaman comics to ever suggest there are magic tattoos. and those tattoos do nothing. so. I have to say that your argument is false
@bloody  obviously I dont need to reply to this
@moon knight  but we had tron underwater....
he is a dif version.  the classic version of aquaman I lame.  even in the animated movies he is dif . aquaman in flash point paradox was diff from aquaman in throne of atlantis are diff.  and he was another version
@spectrexr1  well .yes. they could portray aquaman as a pink-wearing  flamboyantly gay  skinny hipster and that also would be a  different version.  the question is  does mamoa s  different version  capture the comic book character or is it a completely different character who has been given the name aquaman. the answer is   the latter.  just as ezra miller isn t really playing barry allen  he s playing someone else that has flash s name and powers  jason mamoa is playing someone else who has aquaman s name and powers.
didn t know momoa was a script writer
yes he would now!  hahaha!   outrageous!
@jetgoldranger  you have to watch it while eating fish or being in water duh.
@a taste of reality  he s not. the character was obviously written to sound like him or did you just think that was a wild coincidence   myy mann     stop being willfully obtuse.
they ll keep miller
we re keeping my sugar baby who is a mediocre actress
congratulationsyou are selected among my giveaway winners for Christmas
congratulationsyou are selected among my giveaway winners for Christmas    !
most of the actors on the cw  aside from the ones on batwoman lol  were decent to good actors. the fault lied in the writing  production and direction. grant gustin is a good actor but barry allen on thatshow is played like a moron and the show has gotten God awful since season 3  of 4 depending on who you ask
oh and not first. lol
yes just come as you are. bless and based
excellent ending call to faith. thank you.
I want to thank you for that final thought. I really needed to hear that
james gunn is no different than jj abrams  except jj is a better liar.
I would like to see a dr. fate film with pierce brosnan. provided that they dont desecrate the character. I haven t seen black adam and dont intend to. also a phantom  stranger film would be cool.
I agree with you melonie I dont think anybody else can play aquaman like jason mamoa though I will admit I am a bit curious as what his rendition of lobo would be because I think he can play both really well
tbh I wondered at first if they mean the next superman movie will be younger cavill superman. they said due to age it cant be cavill. but then the actor himself said his time is done. if I was gunn I d walk back the statement and say this prequel would set up a proper man of steel 2.
I  also  would like to see a more fit wonder woman carrano would be perfect  but that is not happening unfortunately . the perfect ww would be a live action version of the alex ross s paintings.
they re getting rid of everyone but the one who deserves it  cough  amber
james gunn  how many jokes can I put in this movie
I understand your trepidation of jason momoa not playing aquaman anymore   as I thought the movie was a lot of fun  but there is talk of him being cast to play lobo  I knew next to nothing about the character  but upon rectifying that  it looks like a character that he was born to play.
mel  your hair is my favorite part of this video. well done. thats not something I normally comment on. its just that great.
I agree I bet you this is all going to be trail base like if x does well then that actor will stay but then again we ve seen how inconsistent that is  but how was gothem knights woke Ive seen some trailers and other then in my opinion I doubt red hood would team up with the other bat family what happened
I would like to see karl urban  lotr  2001 - 2003  as batman. maybe jim cavazsziel  passion of the Christ  as green lantern  hal jordan .
I think he s keeping amber heard  and maybe they will make jason lobo
this infighting will only lead to more bad productionso really I dont think this will end well
jason momoha was a decent aquaman but he was born to play lobo so I hope that happens.
he said he wants a younger guy to play superman  yet he s only gal gadot is only 2 years younger then him  he s 39 she s 37 .
if he lying  james better keep his receipts.
God bless melonie. slava bogu.            .
after that ending to this video  subscribed.
how so  you speak of him like he s josh whedon m  is it due to the cure t state of superman and dc  maybe you missed out on suicide dquad and peacemaker
woah woah. gunn is a million times better than abrams.
@moon knight  peacemaker was trash. anything after birds of prey is considered watchable.
@dcmastermind first  how so  oh wait  jj hasn t been found at parties with attendees dressed as underage boys.
@ancestor empire  peacemaker was excellent. get off the crack
@ancestor empire  who cares about those rumours.gunn actually makes excellent movies and tv shows.not abrams.
@blacklives orblackvotes  wrong.peacemaker was excellent and funny as fuck.way better than those kid friendly woke trash tv shows for marvel on disney plus.it got a higher rating too.
@dcmastermind first  james gunn used to make good movies. slither was good  gotg volume 1 was good. everything else has been either meh or trash on rewatch. the main difference between james and jj  james knows the game and how to play it. he will say or do something stupid  then disappear for 6 months  before returning once the casuals have forgotten.
@dcmastermind first  peacemaker was dull and a blowhard. just like seasons 7 and 8 for game of thrones.
carrano woulf be perfect!
I wonder what does she have on these people if she keeps her role  because its said she went to sex parties and has video footage of some extremely powerful people . now if I was her  I d have multiple copies stashed away with trusted people and threaten anything happens to me the tapes get released all over the internet including the deep net.
where did they say they weren t getting rid of her
I guess bc she has a key role idk any other time they d just reshoot her scenes
what s leading to bad production is these ridiculously big budgets because directors and producers have no creative control.
jennifer lawrence is perfect to play superman
of course he s lying.  they are totally clearing everyone out but keeping  his suicide squad peeps.   they are pulling the rug on these actors in shady fashion.
hey melonie it could work a recast for all the superhero but lets be honest it will be hard so I wonder if jason momoa can play as kratos for the new gow tv series.
thank you for that last message
I see all these theories about why gunn is doing this  and everyone seems to be just skating right over the obvious....  he has to wipe the slate clean and start over  because he is not tallented enough to work within the confines and rules of established characters.  by starting over  he gets to decide the powers and the character flaws and the ideology and the motivations of all the dc characters as he goes... its much easier to write bad fan-fiction  when you can just ignore inconvienient character traits that dont work for your basic story telling skills.
the dcu is going to tank. he isn t going to erase his wife.
they already confirmed jason momoa is gone  he s lobo now
thank you for the warm welcome    Im still not a Christian  but  big but  I have been seeing scary representations of biblical prophecy all over the place lately and it has been really making me believe more. keep up your amazing work
I think what s gonna happen is flash will basically change the timeline like in the animated movie but they will kill flash so he cant change it back  baang . . .  a total reset.
watch him recast everyone except amber and ezra
jason mamoa is being recast in the dcu as lobo apparently which I think is a much better fit for him
beautiful  intelligent  funny  tattooed  dc fan  geek girl with a heart for Christ .... yeah  I think you just might be one of the most amazing ladies on youtube
gunn is not ditching all of them. he s keeping ezra and amber  you know the ones he should be getting rid of.
thought I heard or saw somewhere that gal gadot was safe  it was expressed that gunn liked gadot stating that  she has something special.  I ll have to find that
a giant mess.  is the perfect description.
in nicholas cage s voice to warner bros discovery and james gunn about this so-called soft hard reboot   from face off when great nicholas cage says  phuck you  scene for youtube purposes . one of my favorite nicholas cage film. or that great video on youtube with clips of when nicholas cage loses his shit  thats also another reaction that I had when henry cavill was not superman anymore. I am very happy to see henry doing a warhammer cinematic universe and of course  I am thrilled about the upcoming sci-fI adventure film by zack snyder. so I am good. reactions to james gunn wbd making their first decision with henry than the idea of superman followed with reboot idea with this classic video  https   youtu.be 4zyshepf04cfor context making my opinons clear.
congrats melanie  youre on santa s nice list
7 47 - Im a big fan of  batffleck   too.he s actually my favorite incarnation of batman bruce wayne. bale and keaton are tied for second  pattinson is third.
I think to be honest gunn has dug himself in a massive hole and is just making it worse by trying to not understand what fans actually want  his superman movie and slate for dc better be epic or no one will watch after what s happened
Im willing to give a new fresh reboot a shot  but I cant see any way this could work if they just dont recast everybody and reboot every movie show. also this is only if they manage to refrain themselves from making movies about social messaging and politics  so yeah...
she was the first alien with superpowers to be on screen after all
@kevin santos  the reference is completely going over my head which character are youreferring to
oh he s referring to the thing thatshe freaking said its getting her dragged through the mud by dark side and he s telling her straight up that was hunger games b   this is my world no capitals involved how dare you say youre the first woman to bring female action heroes bridget fonda point she better go check mercenaries movie demImoore gI jane
@tiny metal trees  it wouldnt be the first time she wore a pearl necklace either
@one million alpacas  ayyyooooo
jennifer lawrence  by the way  the woman are saving the men around here  you might wanna think about changing the name to superwoman.
that was never confirmed
@chandler burse  the Bible came first
@the bl00d1u5t  and science argues thats because of unadvanced societies always seeking an answer to things. also as a non Christian that answer sounded very intensely Christian like what kind of logic is that  Im a Christian and I wouldn t even say that as an answer but I guess I am just a unfaithful heretic to some older people here probably lol. nothing wrong with questions and considerations.
try reading sites like raptureready and harbingersdaily if youreally want convincing as to how late the hour is.tom hughes  prophecy updates here on youtube are also great.
did he say he was keeping them
@brandon spencer  gunn didn t. zaslav is still running aquaman iI with amber heard and flashpoint with ezra miller. 2 movies I wont see and the reasons why I wont see them. its a shame on aquaman ii. I d like to watch momoa but Im not going if heard is in it.
yes  Imade this video before he said that
then why is it only a minority that care  a majority of people are excited. im sad about cavill  but why the hell are people pretending that james isnt a good writer story teller.
@gavin aeilts  its kinda because gunn s stuff is kinda niche at this point and superman is mainstream well that and the fact the people aren t happy that his plan is a no plan considering that movies from the old dc are still coming outnot to mention that gunn is keeping his own actors and story lines that he personally like or has had anything to do with it just feels very petty to oust henry and the rest because he didn t write those movies
at the very least  it would have been nice to get that man of steel 2 that we were just teased with... and a quality justice league sendoff to tie all the existing introduced characters together.
if this is the hill that james gunn   his ilk wanna die on  so be it
gina carano would make a great wonder woman  its a shame it will never happen. her fight scene versus colossus in the first deadpool movie was awesome.
the term  saving face  comes to mind.
this is good news  it means we can finally get a proper wonder woman played by jennifer lawrence.  the original character was based on her life  after all.
love the disciple lyrics at the end of the video.  peace and love y all
Im with you on momoa melanie  and I generally like all the actors cast in the dceu  or whatever we re calling it  but of course some of the writing has been very shoddy. they really should keep the justice league cast but just sh t can ezra miller and go from there.
my hope for the dc universe is gone. also  make sure you have a kerosene heater   kerosene  and a pump  or a chimney and some wood. winter is coming
last I heard  mamoa is being recast as lobo. not a bad choice. but it will be weird to see the same dc actor in another role. like when I see vulture actor in the m-she-u  I cant get  Im bat..bird-mannnn also  you simp for cavill and mamoa  allow us to simp for gal gadot! I lover her as wonder woman  and at this point  I couldn t see anyone else in that role.
funny enough gunn looks like a dceu villian lol
his cop out and his excuse for letting henry cavill go is an absolute lie  Imean look hugh jackman was 32 years old when he started playing wolverine and he s about to be 56 and he s still playing the role  look at robert downey jr  henry cavill maybe 40 years old but my God he s the best 40-year-old physical specimen that you ll ever find and he could easily play superman for another 10 years  there s no one around that would actually think that he s 40 years old  not to mention he looks like he jumped right out of the comic book onto the screen  and who the hell is james gunn to decide for a whole fan base of what version of superman he s going to put on the screen  Imean if I wanted to watch a younger superman back in metropolis learning how to be a stupid reporter again I d watch some stupid version of superman on the cw  no one has been asking for this for the last 5 years I wish somebody would tell this idiot that
nice to see a fellow Christian in the nerddom. hail and well met!
gunn is keeping all his freinds and family on the wb cash  he is only getting rid of the good actors that are better then any bs he canthink of
hey melonie its almost end of another year.I wanted wish you more great things in 2023.takecare melonie
the more gunn opens his mouth  the more I am reaffirmed in my decision to no longer support any further dc movies.  I am one of the hard core movie goers   normies that these studios covet.  I know of some of these properties but am not entrenched in the comic lore.  I tend to do internet searches after a movie to become more familiar.  but I do support and movies   actors that I feel deserve.  I watched top gun maverick 17 times in the theater because I enjoyed itso much.  I go to the movies every week.  mostly watching replays of older movies through fathom or flashback cinema.  nothing better than seeing casablanca or rear window on the big screen.  thankfully one of the cinemas near me shows foreign films quite often.  so I am able to see many of the good films coming out of places like india  japan  s korea  and singapore.  just so many other films that deserve support.  I have gone past separate artist from the art.  when all I see is the hate spewing sociopath on screen  I cant justify giving these films actors companies any more money for hating and openly disrespecting me.
they should just do an injustice movie and that ll be the best thing they can do or do an injustice show for hbo max and that ll destroy the internet and then they make a movie out to make all the fans happy you start from there cool channel
Ive been reading super man comics my whole life. in my mind he was always a guy in his 30 s. am I wrong   did anyone read those comics from the 80 s and think super man was 20  henry cavil was the best super man we ever had.
the company s involved will make more money on the upset and generational reboot driven by  nostalgia marketing  over the next 5 years  then they would by attaching themselves to an actor who may fall out of favor in the next 2. they do not want to  develop  the story to far  as to not remove the context of  the origin story  because its the most relatable part too a target demographic.I am happy for henry c. I think warhammer 40k is totally a game changer for scifI if captured correctly. not to much really compares to the grim-dark gothic that it offers. and I trust his attachment to  the lore .
I really do think that kevin smith s big lie about masters of the universe and hollywood being shitty in general has made people not believe directors as a rule. and if they act belligerent people take that as confirmation that they know that the film is a stinker.
james gunn wrote some very sick tweets.
yes its all bullshit. cavill could easily do a few more superman films. he still looks youthful enough. they got rid of him so they can save money. recasting the main characters will save them millions in fees.
yeah I always thought late twenties to early 30s
thats because there is no more dceuI think they are calling it the dcu so technically he isn t lying. I hope henry cavil will return in a new role down the future but how convoluted the dceu has become I think it was the only way also I will support everyone except ezra also mamoa as lobo is a better choice than him playing aqua man
so are they going to do a super boy movie or something
hey  go boomer! Im sending good vibes and happy wishes to you throughout the holidays. Im glad that I found you and your channel.
imo henry cavill is a treasure these days! but they hate him because he always stands against crap quality  including woke rubbish  as this is never part of the source material   and they dont like it. but he is back as an executive producer in warhammer 40k cinematic universe. do you know what that means ! finally  he will have a lot to say  and Im quite confident he will deliver something incredible! henry cavill gooooo!
if a fan created company like bat in the sun can make a more faithful rendition of a comic book property with a modest budget than so can a big company like dc and marvel
henry cavil at the trying out for the new superman  Im a dude playing the dude  disguised as another dude!!  lmao
I dont think he s actually lying... as much as he doesnt particularly want to change anything  he just likely will have to because these actors and supporters likely cant wait for him to get to their script written and jobs confirmed  people gotta get played and wb isn t likely to hold bank for people they wont make a movie with soon.
well he isn t fully lieing  they did keep the ezra miller flash movie...sooo they didn t get rid of everyone one  ezra is still there...
jason would be a better lobo.
why does dc always manage to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory
before all this stuff happened  I figured a full reboot was a good idea  however gunn wouldn t have been my first choice to oversee said reboot. they could ve salvaged the remnants of the snyderverse if they wanted to. recast miller  heard and some of the supporting cast  then kept the rest. but if gunn is going to do a reboot  it needs to be an all or nothing deal. he shouldn t biasly keep the characters from the one movie he directed. Im in approach-with-caution mode right now. if gunn actually pulls this off and sticks to the source material  I ll be impressed. just keep the woke identity politics out  and maybe I ll give this a chance!
you mean we wont see ray fisher return
there s no way they can get rid of cavil and keep anyone else.and I think getting rid of gadot is a bigger mistake than getting rid of henry.
I just want a green lantern movie. a good green lantern. is thatso difficult
james gunn is a one trick pony. he is only fit to direct dysfunctional teams that rely on violence and edgy humor. the mainline dc character roster has more depth than he can handle  and is too good for him. when the hell is dc going to learn
aquaman and wonder woman and superman were perfect.I d even say amber heard as mera looked fire  face body only  of course the rest of the cast can easily be replaced.
no one can compare to the first ever superman  jennifer lawrence.
jason mamoa should play lobo.
I feel bad for henry cavill first witcher now superman but also I feel another thing I felt ben affleck played a good older batman  with the little we saw of his batman  he did a good bruce wayne but I would have liked to gotten to seen a solo movie with ben affleck.
nice sentiment with that ending message.  it doesnt apply to me  however. Im not redeemable through your faith  or any type of faith  really. I dont  work  right.
you found this channel ages ago
@thawne  this year
@michael fink  well yes  also holidays is almost at an end once Christmas is finished it would be a while
until they blacklist him after the movie
wasn t that 2011
@strange faced  live action
the trouble with gl is gl has always been more of a  galactic police  hero  which is the opposite of hollywood s modern politics. the only way they ll bring in gl is if they bring in john stewart and make it all about being black.
@honk goes the dynamite  no  the animated one
@stankey poosea  youre right  unfortunately
all Im saying is the guardians of the galaxy being as dysfunctional as they are have more character development and believable humanity  especially with peter s parentage in the second movie  than every single mainline dcu character
@anthony barr  I disagree  as much as I like the guardians  quill and rocket especially   the dysfunction was a crutch and a distraction from how one dimensional they are. wonder woman and man of steel had far more gravity.
if you want to talk about depth and subtlety take a character like rocket  yea he is outwardly violent and lashes out  but if you peek behind the facade you literally see a flawed  scarred individual who is dealing with his issues the only way he has known  with violence. that is why its kind of ironic when you talk about him having no depth in the writing because you are taking it face value and proving his point. and rocket is just one character the most outwardly brash characters in gunns movies are often the most characterized  peace maker  yondu  rocket  drax  peter  nabula
@anthony barr  yeah  but as a fan  you know this because of the character lore and because of cooper s ability to communicate it. not because of gunn s direction or writing. I d wager that it was in spite of it. you probably need to thank nicole perlman instead.
@marxisdead  credit where credit is due but gunn did have a huge part in the writing and direction Imean after all he is the director  and Im more so talking about guardians 2 where she didn t co-write. and you cant lie  those movies are very distinctly gunn flavored. but hey its not like he has a track record of making the most audience receptive superhero movies or anything
@marxisdead  its not even necessarily lore this is stuff established in small character beats on screen  like with drax and matis on ego where she feels his pain and starts sobbing and he s sitting there very stoically. this is stuff that did take his input. sure it can come off as one trick and a lot of it is played for laughs. but it is a marvel movie after all. Im just very hopeful for the fire of dc because as of now the dcu feels very empty and directionless and now gunn has the opportunity to be creatively in control which can go one of two ways  either its insanely good and a true portrayal of the source material or bad but creatively different and risky  both of these options are better than what s going on right now so I can only be hopeful
@anthony barr  and gunn s movies work for marvel characters and an audience that needs an action sequence or dumb joke every 15 minutes. he will basically do to the mainline dc lineup what taika waititI did to the thor franchise. it will be a tone-deaf mockery.
@marxisdead  I feel like that is what dc currently is with joss whedons jl and shazam. but gunn has the keys to the kingdom so we will see Im never opposed to change when what they re doing now ain t working.
@anthony barr  nobody liked whedon s hatchet job  but they liked the snyder cut. the problem is the dc hierarchy shooting themselves in the feet they keep dragging  not learning from previous mistakes  trying to mimick others  and not having a cohesive vision or plan of their own. what worked thematically and visually for marvel does not work for dc.
I wouldn t trust them after lying about man of steel 2 and re-hiring henry. I bet the only person they would keep is margot robbie as harley. her character is quirky and sadly fits their narrative  even though she is a villain. then again  they haven t fired ezra yet. who knows what bs they ll pull at this point in time.
bless you mel!
the amount of pressure the new superman gonna get.. ay melonie  you should audition for lana.
keaton is the dark knight. reeve is superman. michelle pfeiffer is catwoman. john wesley shipp is the flash.
gunn  s first mistake was firing cavil. his second  attacking fans and crying on the interwebs. he is just like the rest.
he s doing what walter hamanda want it to do a year 1 2 ago and its sad
noooooo  he s keeping turd and ezra  because they are fan favorites . Im out. screw gunn. who frigging cares about anyone else than cavill.
now you can have michael cera as superman and seth rogen as batman as you all wanted!  great job!  danny devito can come back as penguin.  steven seagal as deathstroke.   tim allen as booster gold.   denise milanI as ww.  bill gates as calendar man.  harley as greta thurnburg.  this is what the fans wanted.  they never went to the movies.   reboot time.  again and again.
I d prefer to see jason momoa casted as lobo
restorethesnyderverse
what I was hoping for was a mos sequel  a better ww3  both with better directors and scriptwriters   and a live-action remake of the animated jl unlimited series finale. I want jl vs darkseid  period! but the way things are going  gunn is determined to throw the baby out with the bathwater. he will lose the dc fanbase along with that....
just found you. good video. God bless!
I really do think starting over and recasting everyone is the best option  as unfortunate as that is. I love cavill as superman and affleck as batman  but the universe they are in is just a complete dumpster fire that I believe is well beyond salvation. this whole idea of changing some actors and keeping others is  in my opinion  a complete mistake. just start fresh.
they re probably being booted. thats not really effecting my willingness to see the movies. Im still seeing shazam because I like captain marvel and levI s execution. I really just dont even care if it continues on into a bigger world or series afterwards anymore. stand alone movies were kind of the thing for a long time  Im okay taking the last bits of what was supposed to be and calling it quits after.
thank you for the Christian message at the end. I really miss the verse of the day. God bless you and your family. merry Christmas. duane.
you have to watch bvs extented cut to under what was missing . the scene they remove where really important to the movie. but synder got abuse to catch up to mcu.
its not a complete recast  he ll keep ezra miller and amber heard  lol  everybody s favorites
I heard you had to go to er on gary s  nerdrotic  last video! I hope you are ok!
in summary  james gunn s own failures stays. other s past successes go away
everytime dc does something dumb I find a new challenge to subscribe to.....thanks...ig
actually she has recently said she is done as harley.ready to move on
100 . dc destroyed their universe the minute they rushed to compete with marvel by releasing bvs back in 2016.
@equivalent exchange is a lie  absolutely. marvel waited years to make captain america civil war. having a hero vs. hero movie as the second ever in the franchise made zero logical sense. they wanted to have the success of marvel while fast tracking their universe. you cant have your cake and eat it too.
yeah nah . lol dc have had little success  there are very few movies that is cinematic. unpopular opinion but man of steel was trash  the action and fighting was good but cavil isn t superman. he is a great actor tho he ll yea
@moon knight  at least their movies made money before
um suicide squad and peacemaker would like a word with you.
@jos  gregorio zapata   I know bro  but the dc films aren t liked by everyone. man of steel mehh  wonder woman wasn t bad but it wasn t good either in the middle  suicide squad 1 was horrendous  black adam was trash etc.
@jos  gregorio zapata nooo they did not
@dcmastermind first  before james gunn
yeah  its true. dc is a complete disaster  but I dont think retaining james gunn s characters from box office flops is the best idea
I guess it makes sense that james gunn wouldnt recast the suicide squad actors because its a movie he ditected  he doesent seem to mind recasting any other chararcters in the dceu though
they ll never get rid of their God  ezra miller
random but appreciated. glory to God.
hey melonie I just wanted to tell you that you are doing a fantastic job with the interview on nina infinity streaming show this evening  ok melonie. anyway also I just wanted to tell you that I think that james gunn is lying about it and I think that he needs to go and have someone else to take over his duties and job and let henry cavill come back and continuing to play his part of dc character of superman and let other actors and actress continuing to do their job of playing dc characters too and let them keep getting paid for their job of making dc movies for dc company  ok melonie. anyway I just wanted to tell you that and I just wanted to tell you that you are doing a fantastic job with the interview on @nina infinity streaming show this evening  ok melonie. anyway hope you have a wonderful and great blessed evening at home and have a good night too melonie.
ben affleck was is for sure the quintessential bruce wayne.  much like rdj is the quintessential tony stark.  batman will always  sound like  kevin conroy because childhood memories... but seeing ben play bruce felt like it was just real life  not even acting
God bless you! youre an inspiration to Christians everywhere.
he tried to save face. thats it.
either recast completely  or he will face more backlash than he already has for firing henry.
im just going to watch something else  im done with this universe
gal gadot was not bad but batfleck was kickass. oh and odin never asks that you kneel but be strong and fight!!
if they dont do a complete recast then the henry cavill thing is going to piss me off even more
of course jennifer is returning.....she s dating james gunn lol maybe thats what he means   everyone s getting recast except my girlfriend
will we have an unfeminine wonder woman next  I thought gadot was awesome in that role  and not just for her beauty. you could really believe thatshe never knew life without such strength.
cavill leaving basically doesnt give them any choice but to reset.
why replace cyborg actor   there s a different actor who plays cyborg in doom patrol
I hope he s being honest. I would like to think he s pulling ww cameo in the flash is to close up the universe snyder built and is using gal gadot to start working on things for gunns universe.
shazam! was excellent levI is so good.
krama works mysteriously and hilariously. its funny that you have a stalker.
I wonder what happened with the gal galdot patty jenkins cleopatra movie.
continuously having to hit the reset button eventually leads to the destruction of the architecture
childhood memories are not the only reason conroy is objectively the best batman even without live appearance.
he needs to make a public apology and bring henry and those whom he said who was recast back right now he s going to get burnt and dig a hole that you cant get out of he might get fired
@Christopher loyd he said no I believe in a recent tweet
cavill didn t leave he was forced out. dc wanted to reset rather than bring cavill back. this was all on dc  not cavill
I am okay with them erasing the whole cast except for henry cavill and gal gadot.. we could use a more accurate aqua man tbh. Imean he is supposed to be blond. they gave us a dark haired samoan
I personally feel that getting rid of all the jl cast was a decision made by zazlav because he is a notorious penny pincher and probably does not want to shell out the millions for cavill  gadot  affleck  etc when they could get new up and coming actors that could be paid way less. this is a horrible decision and the wrong approach to running a major franchise.
james gunn sees what the mcu has become and said to his assistant  hold my soy  no one s going to out woke dc.
gina carano for wonder woman
I would like to see momoa as lobo.  I think that would be a better fit.by the by  the chosen season 3 is off to an awesome start.  melonie   you need something to heal your mind after watching she-sulk.  plus it would be cool to have someone with a little more secular audience to put some more eyes on it.  it is great television.
I bet he wont get rid of peace maker.
I hated man of steel. I remember thinking henry would ve made a fantastic superman if he was playing the blue boy scout version. superman shouldn t kill. but he really made that roll his own mouth he s out its just not the same.
if they re gonna recast aquaman  they should go with johnny depp. he already knows his way around the ocean and has worked with ah in the past....
I have loved jason since game of thrones
there s a problem when harley quinn has more appearances than jl members
also  Im with you miss mac. I got a huge man-crush on jason momoa.
he seems to forget that the only successful projects he s made  the guardians franchise  stars are all hovering around 40.
just own it. youre a batman girl.
nice words at the end
if james fires zachary levI I will not watch one movie directed by him. not. one.
we ll just have to wait and see
warner bros messed up by trying to fast forward through the process.  marvel did it right for the most part  by building up characters in solo films over time  then bringing them together.  this way you end up with a stronger foundation to build upon.I think they were thinking  everyone knows who batman  superman and wonder woman are.  we dont need to establish them. .  big mistake.  not everyone knows the characters like that  even iconic ones  and not everyone knows who you ve chosen to play them  or is necessarily on board.  they need a bit of time at first.they also divided the fandom with how they handled things storywise.
thank you dear sister melonie and God bless you inn Jesus mighty awesome beautiful name amen
get well soon!
the reason they recast superman for  younger  is that younger is code for  effeminate and not masculine
how is gunn woke   in what way
I really wanted to watch the chosen  but saw a post on insta from the actor who played john the baptist bragging about his satanic film being successful on easter
@melonie mac go boom  he s a satanist yet he played john the baptist. must be very open minded.eh probably not a real satanist.
@melonie mac go boom  the cast is sag.  that doesnt bother me  since the creator director has control.  the cast actually want to tell the story of Christ  for various  reasons.  and there have been cast members who have come to the Lord since this thing has began.   creepy john  what simon peter calls him in the show  is a small part  his screen time is minimal  and  spoiler!  not looking to be much longer.
well I dunno about that.rebooting the dcu will mean things change
haha its true
best not too piss off a stalker by posting a video calling him out. he s  going to get more upset back  not go away. just saying not the best idea. there s  some off people out there and posting about them will only make them do worse stuff.  look at Christina grimmys story he shot her 3 times then killed himself. but I hope you stay safe.
I dont see how a young superman could fit without recasting the rest of the dc film universe. superman is the foundation of the dcu. planning it any other way is putting the cart before the horse and will lead to folly.
thanks for the message at the end. Jesus is Lord!!!
are they still doing the blue beetle
love the message of Jesus redemption at the end of the video. love one another.
why is gunn denying the obvious  bad way to start a relationship...
if youre not going to bring henry cavill back is superman you have to completely recast  everyone knows that ben affleck is not coming back as batman  and its just confirmed that if they took out the cameo that henry cavill shot for the flash and they re not going to use the cameo from gal gadot in the flash then why would you keep any of those actors and youre going to recast the entire universe  of course he s lying through his teeth just like he said he had no intention of recasting superman even though we come to find out that he s been riding a superman movie for a younger version of superman for a while  the man s a liar he s trying to save face now because he s been on social media and he knows that he s getting destroyed for not keeping henry cavill  I dont believe a word this man says and plain and simple fact is if he was as talented of a writer as everyone says he could have kept henry cavill and created a new dc universe with the parts of dc characters that have already been established and that fans really want to see not another younger version of superman we ve seen 682 times
here s an idea  everyone that didn t star as superman  batman l  aquaman and wonder woman goes. no one was attached to cyborg. we all know ezra miller needs to go for obvious reasons. dc s new head of dc films seems to be taking up the dc is allergic to money trait.
not many people know this but james gunn on of those adrenochrome elite
its all so confusing with conflicting info that contradicts the logic of their choices. like  I get wiping it all and have a clean slate. a part of me wonders if the reason they are doing it is to have actors and actresses around for a long time. like long time. but idk. either way  what doesnt make sense is saying that but then focusing way too much on the flash movie. that basically no one cares about. if it was a stepping stone to understand a batman beyond movie or another movie for keaton it would make sense. but its on its own. so all it ends up being is sheer and utter confusion.
15 02 there s a quote by cicero iirc   dum spiro  spero.     while I breathe  I hope.
ezra is a criminal! yet he is retained and cavill fired  says it all I need to know about thatstudio. gone!!
I wasn t aware gotham knights was woke  but I haven t played it yet. what was woke about it
it d actually be worse if he wasn t. that would mean of all the actors he s solely decided to cut out  henry cavill and gal gadot were on the list. those aren t 2 actors who deserve it
agree to disagree. if they do not recast ww and aquaman  it will make him seem like a hypocrite. he better recast every single character if we are not getting cavill back as superman. he doesnt get to pick and choose who goes and who stays if this is described as a hard reboot. hard reboot means literally a fresh start  a clean slate.
when are they going to make under the red hood 2!  give the fans what they want. wasn t the first an action marvelou...Imean decadent choice masterpiece!
to paraphrase an old saying  if it acts like a woke and quacks like a woke then it must be a woke.
the best decision warner bros. ever made was to hire henry cavill. and their worst decision was to fire him.timothy chalamet will be the new superman. please hold your applause.
merry Christmas melonie mac
what snes games do you like  melo
sorry  wrong video I have to switch  to phone  to comment I was trying to comment on the stalker video a week from now
oh good. I have zero clue what to do for a tattoo but now I know I dont need one! I ll just  indentify  as a tattooed Christian girl and Im good to go!
Im good with recast  grant gustin should be the only flash
I think alexander skarrsgard would make a great aquaman.
I dont watch new movies typically. northman was the newest film I saw. before that the only good movies from new releases I saw upon the new release and were worth the money were the wolfman 2009 before that was sweeney todd 2008 and before that lotr 2001- 2003. other than that I dont watch new movies new released movies and tv older film tv is better. novels and videogames are better than movies and tv anyway.
melonie  thank you for sharing Jesus in your video.
warner seems to be doing everything in their power to piss off the fans and ensure that they wont be going to see future wb films.  they really need to ditch amber heard and ezra miller but keep henry cavill  gal gadot  and ben affleck.  they dont need to change the cast just to do a reboot.  gal gadot did a great job in the role  and she s a real life warrior woman.  there s nobody better suited to her role as wonder woman.  the one thing thats wrong with the dceu is the writing.  if they ditch the woke nonsense and hire people who can actually tell good stories they ll be fine.  but I dont trust wb to have that much intelligence.
praise be!
the fastest turn to attack fans ever
Im all in for taylor lautner as superman. then the next batman v superman can be a twilight reboot. embrace
melanie I doubted you but now I see the light.  lol. you do hijack every video to speak about lara croft!
gunn has already damaged the box office by the recasting s. honestly who cares about the flash and aquaman 2 now knowing the tory is pointless. thats on top of ah and miller still in their roles in the upcoming films. we dont want a young superman we already have a superman. asaz pointed out in the drinkers open bar stream a few days ago. this may not be a superman origin story but will still be a origin story. the first time clark meets lois  jimmy  perry  lex etc. which might be a good thing start with a clean slate but why not give us a great farewell film with the actors to say goodbye before recasting. because everything thats happened recently I dont see this new dc doing any better might be aa lot of money destined to go down the toilet.
marvel and dc have been pooping the bed so long  and so hard. Im pretty sure there is more poop than bed !
I think samuel jackson plays a good superman.
the more I look into this story its total woke bs. how do you keep peacemaker and decide to change the timeline. he doesnt like cavil  or zs characters
recast james gunn.
I dont think gunn is lying I think right now they are very much in a developmental stage and dont know what will happen tomorrow let alone next year... if you look at it from a financial stance its a smart decision wb can not afford to spend a 100 million on a cast at this point... his writing style does not fit a super serious superman like the synder verse... personally I am excited to see what they have planed fuck the synderverse it was a snooze fest
I dont want to see a younger superman right now. I want my man of steel 2.0
james is so woke he makes rian johnson blush. the dsheu is coming  bet on it.
the backlash he s going to get for keeping his characters but firing the rest is going to be insane  if he does that the narcissism level must be off the chain.personally there is zero point in watching any of these movies coming up in 2023  shazam 2 pointless  flash pointless  blue beatle pointless  aquaman 2 pointless so there s no point in supporting any of these movies at all.to scrap henry cavill who was universally loved as superman is just nuts  however one actor that could take on the role of a younger superman is joshua orpin  looks like henry cavill  great as superboy in titans. gal is 37  henry is 39 they could easily play the part for 10 years. so if he s rebooting reboot the entire thing  dont just cheery pick your own characters to remain.
I enjoyed the whole video but starting from 14 40 is the most important part of the whole video.
big God about this the wrong way. first of all you should come out in the movie and say that youre going to get rid of this guy this guy this guy and this guy at least tell people that you got expand from their characters or something or introduced  super boy or something to that effect. there s been rumors that henry cavill fired his management team which means he fired dwayne the rock johnson s wife that was managing his career because they both had the same manager so who knows what is true and what isn t true but this whole thing is such a debacle from the very beginning  nothing is kept secret anymore. nobody keeps a tight lid on anything and there s too many people talking now do I believe that henry cavill should ve been fired or let go or whatever happened as far as him being super mean oh hell no you ride that that wagon trade gravy trade whatever you want to call it as long as you possibly can until you personally started showing gray hair you could you could do old style  superman  old man  superman or something to that effect he would still be in great shape it wouldn t be hard for him to get into shape when zachary levI wears a muscle suit. he doesnt wear a suit on a zone and he s in his 40s.
also in other news  that  report  that was going around about henry cavill s behavior behind the scenes on witcher was totally false. all the feminists were raging over henry and the person who released it is like  ya I didn t verify the information so dont take what I said as true . I dunno  maybe dont spread heresy in the first place
I feel very sorry for the wife of that monster
of course his wife will be staying. he ll probably recast her as wonder woman. he gives his brother all kinds of screen time in the guardians and he literally plays an npc who no one gives a shit about.
long live the snyderverse
they re not recasting  everyone .  they re keeping ezra miller.  because that makes sense.
I think a full reboot would be better  it makes more sense then getting rid of the most popular actor for no reason. also jason will be a better lobo than aquaman
supergirl needs to be back on !!!!!!!
I think its time for a hard reboot of the dceu. james gunn needs to lean into it. Ive liked a lot of the films  but broadly they haven t had the success of the mcu. understandable for them to take a different approach.
I agree
I prefer the dc animated movies over the live action  thats my opinion. those are top shelf. but I see jason as aquaman and gal as wonder woman no questions ask. kick ezra flash and ben batman out  fine with me
Im with you on jason mamoa. Im already iffy since he cut cavill on superman  but if he gets rid of mamoa  I wont watch it at all! aquaman was probably one of their best movies that they produced! I ll also say gal gadot as wonder woman was a good casting decision  but once they went woke  it went downhill! really sad to see she went that way knowing the left hates israel  and she herself being an idf veteran really surprised to see her support for all their ideology I guess money has more power over people than us plebes could understand.
we making a young supermanwe got one its called brightburn
I ll be honest here  as much as I agree that henry shouldn t have been taken off the role  I can understand the pov of nuking everything and starting afresh.I think that people have been taking everything a bit to far even  its way too early to call judgement on the new dceu. its getting near to a slander situation with some fans  and I see a lot of unfair and unfounded criticism as well.such as  they are removing cavill  but erza miller and ah get to stay  while forgetting that aquaman 2 and the flash are already ready for release  so they cant be cancelled any longer  more importantly they both coat far too much to be dismissed  and wb will need to recoup those losses to fund the new universe.black adam could ve been the movie to get those funds  but people didn t give it a change and let it fail miserably. and yet people expected aquaman 2 a movie that was already done  to be rewritten completely to remove ah  and the same for flash  wb may be filled with millionaires  but money doesnt grow on trees. I understand erza and ah deserve being erased from the scene  but the expectations are simply unreasonable  when the dceu has been filled with failures and money losses. erza and ah will not stay  they have already said this more than once  but people think that they are booting henry cavill just so they can stay with erza and ah. they are not only pulling this assumption off their asses  these actor s situations couldn t be as far from each other as it already is.the flash and aquaman 2 were movies made by the old wb leadership  they are literal bombs that the current wb leadership has to deal with  and they need to get some money for them if they expect to fix the image of the company.however people simply expect them to asspull resources out of nowhere.and that is simply unreasonable. even channel s like call me chato  who had been very critical of wb and dc  had already recognized that they cant simply ditch these 2 movies. so yeah wb is pretty much screwed  even if they hadn t decided to recast he actors people would still find a way to be pissed at them because of these movies.
they can just leave the mess and make new ones in the same dceu. there s no reason they cant do both young and mature superman. marvels movies barely continue its only the after creditscene that connects to the next film and sometimes it didn t even. the dc cast was strong. it was the material that was so so.
its whatever at this point. I just hope gunn does something half way decent with the new dceu. some actually serious story lines without unnecessary humor. take a different approach than marvel. you guys already tried   failed. just follow the 1990s   2000s dc animation. those stories were great   had a maturity to them.
jason mamoa is more suited to be the submariner. ryan gosling would have been a better choice for aquaman  just my opinion
past dc failures lead to this
melanie  as you said   its a damn mess behind the scenes.  a clean slate is probably the best way.  they cannot move forward and  make a great dceu if they keep one foot in the past using puzzle pieces from synderverse.  if they dont fix it at this point and ditch a sinking ship  wb will be facing bankruptcy in a few years or less.
I love gal Godot  henry cavil and momoa   they must not be recast the script they got sucked...
lol she s literally an actress that is in his dcu stuff already. she s perfectly happy with all of it
the verse is dead bury it
where did they say that
@brandon spencer  oh look  I was right in predicting what any idiot could see was going to happen.  lol.
you should watch the shows too. almost all the animated shows and movies are tied in together. the dcau is so good!
with the exception of ezra miller and amber heard  the best thing that dceu has going for it is the casting decisions. throwing out those casting decisions is probably the worst thing they could do.
disney has sent james gunn with the anti-life equation to destroy all of the dceu.
a jacked up wonder woman  lol   batman vs superman is literally one of the best films in comic book films
so they re not scrapping everyone  only the actors associated with the work of someone other than himself. -_-that just reeks of ego
the mcu should cast them all as their marvel equivalent villans in the squadron supreme.
this is all sad news! with marvel becoming so woke its hard to watch  this was the perfect time for dc to steal their crown! I think youre right  ditch the problematic actor  keep the rest!
am kinda simping for you ngl. nice videos.
the only other issue I take with all this  it has a very spider-man no way home vibe  so many lies to keep people in suspense but done in such a despicable way that it is hard to see what they are planning. now if they do recast everyone  but keep jason momoa as another character  he needs to be lobo  and they could keep ezra miller as eobard thawn lol.
one big woke hot mess but dont dump in everyone!
here s the thing about gal gadot... no  she isn t the best actress in the world. no debate there. but c mon... she s defined the role by now. to millions of people  she is wonder woman
mel  may I call you mel  you do realize that jason mamoa s aquaman is just a roughneck atlantean version of lobo... dont you  gunn is going to make mamoa lobo  something that even jason mamoa himself is allegedly excited about. there s no real loss here  frankly. unlike the travesty of losing henry cavill as superman --which gunn will fail miserably at recasting!!! point is...mamoa s good.
its show business not show fair lol
the wife stays... for now
I can understand gunn wanting to clean house and start fresh with new actors.
gotta be honest. momoa is an automatic write-off for me and I ll tell you why. charley chaplin s career was all but destroyed by his film  the great dictator . reason being  people of the day wanted to go to movies to be entertained. they didn t want the movies to political. now  to be entirely fair to  the great dictator  it is perhaps one of the most important films in cinema history just for the final speech. but again films are to entertain  not brow beat people with a persons  opinion. and... really thatspeech echo s strongly even now. dont be a machine man  with a machine heart. be a person of flesh   blood. a person who feels  has compassion and empathy for their fellows. not a cold unfeeling creature that only follows the orders of which ever person s that is incharge.getting back to momoa and modern hollyweird  he like most of the people in hollywood is a leftist. even outright says dont watch his movies or follow him if you support trump republican views. while I do not support cancel-culture behaviour  that is the tactics of communists and fascists  Im also not willing to spend my very hard earned money enriching the life of someone who considers me to be dirt. why reward awful behaviour  I haven t watched a hollywood movie in about 6 to 8 years. not likely to ever again.speaking as socially conservative  financially liberal individual.
so  he keeps his wife and fires henry. ummmm
if no one else is being recast  that just brings credibility to the idea thatsuperman is literally only being made younger in order to get rid of cavill because he s not one of the narcissistic losers in hollywood.what other reason could there be  cavill being 39 years-old is no excuse  because harrison ford is still playing a digitally de-aged indy while being twice that age. there are still plenty of films cavill can do before he ages out. to recast him and rewind time a bit  but without making any other major changes  is extremely sus. thats exactly the only thing you would need to do in order to ditch an actor.this is of course to say nothing of the fact that cavill is as popular with fans as rbd has been playing iron man. the same fans who are calling for amber heard and ezra miller to be fired  and seemingly being ignored. not a coincidence if you ask me.
I def think he s getting rid of everyone and I think its very dumb. they should just use the flash movie to cause a shift in realities and just recast the flash  batman  and cyborg moving forward. so dumb they just made these other movies like black adam  shazam  2   suicide squad  and supposed to make ww3.
I appreciate the Christian comments. I want everyone to be free to be who they are  including people of faith.
to be honest dc should completely start over with a clean slate  as long as they stay away from the woke crap. but thats a pipe dream.
cavill would make an awesome hyperion
gadot as zarda as well.
she s not a good actress  but she does well in small roles. she s good as a background character and eye candy. she works really well as a side character. but wonder woman is too prominent a role for someone of her caliber.
@brandon spencer  but he was not  in the eyes of anyone  the cause of it being a mess  and does not deserve to be some kind of fall guy  while the same attitide that was responsible  plays itself out behind the scenes. if there s a hard reboot coming  thats standard  but gunn denies that  so by all appearances  the slime of humanity is lashing out at the champion of fans. especially if heard and miller are nonsensically safe here.
@auto clock  yes he was.wipe the slate clean.you and other fans will get over it eventually
jason momoa is being recast as lobo.
gunn is doing nothing but actively pursue antagonism. its desperate and pathetic behaviour. its like all the filmmakers are doing it now because they know full well they are ruining a much loved story or character for the sake of the woke message  and the majority of fans will be critical about it. so they get in there first and paint themselves as the victim when really they are the vandal.
new person comes in  they tend to clean house and start over. you dont want the stink of the old stuff  so start with a clean slate.
I am done with wb and dcu. I am sick of being called toxic  and we the fanbase are being ignored. gunn is a hack  and his suicide squad movie was a failure  and this is who zaslav wants to run dcu . cavill was the last straw I guarantee this new universe will fail. look at wbs stock after they fired cavill. a lot more backash is to come. too bad people weren t  ready for snyders  vision  it was one of a kind..
the only big dceu actor that didn t get touched in this was margot robbie as harley quinn probably because she worked with him before and the fact that her portrayal of harley has been positively received and plus he cant pull the age card on her cuz margot is 32 years old and harley quinn herself has always been depicted as being between her late 20 s to her mid 30 s.
gunn is an mcu trojan horse that will only make dc homoginized and woke..
just a theory. james gunn wants them all to be younger actors to do origin stories and trilogies solo films in order to build background stories leading up to new justice league cross overs. as opposed to one man of steel leaping into batman vs superman   justice league just after one film
anyone would be better than momoa to play aquaman.
the dceu is over. to be fair to gunn  its been over for a while now. the cast  other than caville  is sub-par at best. basically super models who cant act  plus an old dude playing batman  and a psychopath playing flash . no direction. no plan. no spinoffs. no tv shows that aren t terrible.I dont blame gunn for this  but he is lying because he has a sinking ship to raid before its entirely submerged.
I really liked cavill as superman and Im sad to see him go  but I dont see how a total reboot recast is inherently a bad thing we dont know who they re going to cast as their replacements we dont know what they re going to do in the future  until they actually start producing bad movies Im gonna look on the positive side and say they re just trying to wipe the slate clean. and do everything right from the beginning
the justice leauge should not be Gods like snyder thought
I wonder who they are going to find to play superman now. finn wolfhard  liam hemsworth
all these dc movies will never be as good as Christopher nolan s dark knight trilogy movies with Christian bale. in terms of tone  storytelling  and style  he perfected batman with his movies and nailed how to make a great dc movie. with all the changes going on for dc and warner bros  dc has no clue what to do anymore. they will never be good like the marvel cinematic universe is. they might as well stick to making animated series and animated movies. heck  a lot of the arrowverse shows were better than any of the dceu movies. arrow  the flash  supergirl  black lightning  legends of tomorrow  and even titans were great. even with the crossover events they did. the real justice league team were in the arrowverse crossover shows.
tbh... I really dont care what happens in the dceu. I almost cared with henry cavill - he took a terrible superman and seemed to go  well this is shit. Im just going to play a heroic superman anyway  regardless of how incongruent it is to what is being written.  and made superman work. I also actually liked gal gadot as wonder woman  and while I do like the idea of a ripped wonder woman... she s essentially a Goddess. the laws of mortality dont apply to her  so she needs to look appropriate for a Goddess.  like seriously  how does she get ripped and stay ripped - does she have some kind of super-gym with barbells and other weights made of essentially magical materials that let it weigh 5  50  and 500 tonnes but fit in her hand and dont cause her to tip over because she doesnt weigh 500 tonnes  does she just get to the point where she can lift 500 tonnes and her body just stays that way without needing to keep working out  how does superman keep his stamina up - does he have to fly to some planet with ridiculous gravity where he actually might get some kind of a work out  etc. etc. etc. overall  I ll wait until the first movie from gunn s new decu is out before passing any judgement. Imight just plain ignore it all anyway  particularly if it ends up going on hbo more than into theatres.
its the dcu now.
they may be trying to save box office draws by not revealing details about certain actors  but its too late for me. I was considering seeing shazam in theaters  as I enjoyed the first one  but now I ll just wait for streaming. I still haven t seen aquaman in its entirety. its a horribly boring movie and I cant even stick with it for five minutes.and the flash  I was never going to see that garbage with that horrible actor to begin with. knowing that he might be a horrible person as well just sealed that deal.
so  not a complete recast ... just everybody who wasn t in a james gunn project.
I just think they re going to follow the amazon wrongs of power plan and say  hey  let s get all these cheap no-name  little-talent actors  scriptwriters  and showrunners so we can put out entertainment that is just as good and save boatloads of money.
for a guy with 3 good movies in a very-narrow sub-genre  comedy superhero  that fires the best superman in superman live action history  film   tv ...  I really think he s already fucking up and is  I guess  trying to do comedy-superhero crap which I no longer watch as its getting quite tedious.
jennifer lawrence will return as superman because she played it first..
actually according to gunn the entire suicide squad cast will be recast
@dcmastermind first  I highly doubt he ll recast them. they re like his family and the one he made was positively received so there d be no point plus they ve always existed in their own little bubble in the dceu
there might be some truth to that maybe with superman
lol how the fuck has gunn been  over  now both his suicide squad and peacemaker were fantastic
gunn s about to make dc unrecognizable.
if jason mamoa is going to become lobo  you get chris hemsworth for aquaman.
gunn is a whiner baby  nobody should be surprised it kind of the way the game is played today. as for recasting its all about the money  stepping over dollars to pick up dimes  a true superman movie with henry cavill would be a big hit  if they keep the woke bs out and let superman be superman dont nerf him.
rather cavill leave the role than be in another terrible superman movie. only time will tell if the gunnverse will be even worse than snyder s vision.
fan service in both ways  come on lol
I would rather have henry cavell over jason mamoa. I think anyone can play aquaman he is the lamest super hero  I think jason mamoa should have been lobo
guys! the rock just spoke!  firejamesgunn
honestly the dceu needs a full reboot and recast. keeping old actors and mixing them with new ones just isn t a good move.
they ll recast jennifer lawrence as wonder woman
ezra miller s sex cult   thats fine.   amber heard s abuse lawsuit   defensible.  tanahasI coats superman   let s not be too hasty cancelling that movie.   suicide squad lost money   let s put him in charge of the whole thing.
so whats your interest in jason
gina carano could be a fantastic wonder woman. gal gadot is hot and thats why she was casted let s not fool ourselves. jason momoa is my guy even if he is always himself in every movie just like ryan reynolds. henry cavill is superman and no other man alive will be accepted by my allmighty wallet so my money stays with me. this woke content all companies are putting out is make me save a lot of money.
he def wont be recasting ezra miller and amber heard.
at 14 52 are you talking to the guys who change lara
honestly at this point I hope they recast everyone except ezra miller and amber heard. I want the whole thing to burn to the f cking ground.
grease  buttergirl   those women were not high schoolers surrounding john travolta  and people loved  greased lightning !
michael keaton - done
it ll be recast except miller and heard
no henry cavill  no superman
who the hell asked for another young superman rehash anyway !
good
I dont think so.he s gonna recast superman and then go from there.
I actually think jason will be a great lobo. its much more fitting for him than being aquaman. him as aquaman made no sense. I also think jason could be a great conan the barbarian.
@stankey poosea  he already tried conan  and it was a flop. it had this huge build up and then the day it came out nobody was talking about it. when that happens you know a movie is done.
@albert nada retro  that was jason mamoa ! he looks totally different now  even his voice is different. must be all the performance enhancing drugs.
yeah but it works if you do a flashpoint movie. but the actors they are keeping are the worst possible options so they are shooting themselves in the foot after restarting the race.
I would venture to say that no one has asked for a younger superman
the fans are also their money tree.keep giving fans crap and that money tree will quit producing fruit  even more than it already has.
obviously
the only recasting that needs to happen is in the management
remember they replacing four actors thats 60 million jason momoa is going to be lobo you can get younger actors and sign them to contracts because at the end of the day people watch the movie not for the actors for who the hero is because of the internet we get all these hidden secrets all this is about money thats all it is they re only allowed to spend so much on a budget and they need to get the budget back Im not defending one or others but its better that they cut off these actors then they sell the company to another company that doesnt know what they re doing because it looks like we re not going to get movies that we like anytime soon at least the boys cobra kaI and invincible are simple television shows gave us more than the marvel and the dc universes then all the bs at the end television shows are better my opinion keep up the great work its just my opinion just keep going forward
merry Christmas woman
cavill should be the next bond.
well damnation.
jason momoa ftw!gal gadot ftw!!henry cavill ftw!!!
pervy stuff is what we want. member the black window ass shots from avengers  Imember.
in all honesty the dceu imo had pretty great casting  the writers were the issue tbh  except ezra miller. he can leave
I wont miss gal gadot.
the official dc studios  start in 20224
jason momoa as lobo
why they trying to cancel my boy henry   my girl gal... wtf...
thanks be to God!
go boom!!!!!
honestly  its either the return of the snyderverse or a full reboot. a semi-reboot or a continuation of the current dceu isn t going to work.
would like a wonder woman with bigger um assets lol
replacing most of the dceu is a bad idea recasting mamoa as lobo fits him but who will play aquaman  roman reigns mamoa should stay as aquaman and give lobo to roman reigns  gal gadot makes a great wonder woman   ezra miller well him n amber heard deserve to be replaced but sadly they ll need to do at least one more movie with them and after that could be replaced
more recasting and rebooting....yay  except they re keeping the tanehisI coates jj abrams superman project going.
too old.
why  she was by far the best thing they did
yeeeah gal gaddis was a little too skinny. needs some muscle
I agree with melonie  more fanservice!
zachary levI too
Im sorry
if gal gadot were to be replaced  who would be in your opinion the best choice  the one that comes to mind is..... ronda rousey
fan service for the sake of fan service is totally   completely stupid and insulting to the fans. fan service should only suit to serve   respect the storyline   source material. sorry to say this mel but youreally need to do a comprehensive study of these characters in order to better understand them. Ive been a comic book fan for over 40 years and have seen the movie industry bastardize these characters and insult the fans  intelligence and basically attempt to force them into liking them and convincing them to believe that there s no way remaining true to the source material is even remotely possible
martha enough said
100 000 around the corner!
never minded some lewd fanservice
they still make silver play buttons ah well we ll find out soon enough. Godspeed  nerd next door!
from all possibly varients  they decide to choose the worst. they just should keep snyder-cast and make another movies. they all what fans them ask. in that case all we will happy. fans will be have hope about snyderverse  sometime in future   wb in that time just make joker trilogy and pattinson the batman trilogy. in that time they can return everyone including zack snyder. all  what thay need to do - its just wait and keep snyder-cast.
jason will be lobo
thought itsaid racist not recast lol. but either way  it works lol
let s go full kevin smith and lie in your faces....but good news! we gonna keep black superman project and amber herd!
Im not watching any superman movie that does not involve henry cavill. they know thats what the fans want and they are denying us that on purpose. as long as this behavior continues  no money from me. easy pass.
getting rid of henry and possibly gal gadot...............talk about killing the goose that lays your golden eggs.
amen
I wasn t even a fan of the suicide squad and peacemaker so every film of live action dc build up over the last 12 years can burn for all I care.
no-one does wonder woman like gal gadot
is that ink seeping into your blood stream
lol to be fair if wb stock drops much lower the entire dc studio may just collapse.
lol buuuuucky!
he s totally lying. but now he knows all the movies will bomb now that there s  no investment in them. so now he s trying to save face because wb is going to lose millions if not billions.
how to destroy an ipo in 3  2  1
keep up the good work      . and as a non drinker who s lost family. to alcohol caused effects. I find critical drinker  to be a pretty  grading name  and bad influence.  maybe critical bad influence is a better name
sean bean would have been my choice for the long haired aquaman not jason mamoa. ben affleck was good as batman. he was no michael keaton but still great. though his costume looked ridiculous. frank miller s costume doesnt translate well to live action. henry cavill is awesome btw.
the only id believe are being replaced are erza miller by grant gustin n ben affleck by robert pattinson
there is a reason snyder s movies kept making more money with each film  surpassing 1.2b in a single movie  an aquaman movie no less. im honestly sick of generic superhero movies. if this shit happened in the 90 s no one would be defending it.
you do know that aquaman is a blonde  right
id be happy for a complete reboot the dceu failed why try to fix a broken thing instead of making something new that is not broken they rushed the universe they should take their time now
how do you still look twenty lol
13 55 didn t listen 10 sec because of my kitten. but you said something with  poop in the bed . is it about a.h.  she has to pay 1 million. j.d.  will donate it to charity. not pledge. donate
birds of pray shouldnt stay lol
james gunn isn t talented enough to be doing what he s doing ...
can we nominate melonie for a wonder woman replacement
the dceu needs a reboot the old one is a mess.
its ok melonie  we get it. straight women love jason momoa.
henry cavil was their biggest   and most beloved actor in dc universe. bam they kick him out.... this is beyond hilarious. is idocracy  d d  d d d d d d d d
either way  Im not watching any more dc movies. haven t watched marvel in a while  and now I wont watch dc either.at least Godzilla s doing well.
I dont understand the hissy fit over what s going on with dc and personally this is just one of the things I hate about comic book films. if someone gets recast or something then people act like the world is coming to an end.
you can replace everyone in suicide squad except harley quinn
if not a complete recast thats just idiotic but I bellied he is recasting everyone except those who were in his suicide squad  except the cameos  and peacemaker and thats simply stupid
margot is starting to get too old
she could easily do another 3 films. anything beyond that might be true if you are talking long term
however suicide squad teams do tend to change frequently
bvs ultimate edition is the only way to watch that movie the theatrical cut was awful and all over the place.
james gunn is shouldn t be charged dcuojason is be lobo
think they losing too much money especially on big hollywood names. he probably seeking actors with reasonable salaries so he can make a movie with a decent budget. let s be honest spending 100 million on 5 actors is a waste especially since now people are critical and less interested in going to cinema to watch copy and paste films.
comic book movie casting is going down the drain  by the way  Jesus loves you. both messages are true.
they are being quiet to not kill proceeds on upcoming aquaman2 and shazaam 2. because if fans knew they were clearing the slate  no one would go watch those movies. there would be no point.   he just sent a message to dc fans not to even bother. no one wants another young early days clark kent superman. this is total garbage.  Im  checked out now.
shout out to Jesus!
they should recast everyone and reboot. start over. I think those movies and that universe is awful. there s not a single good movie I d watch again. mcu is going way down hill. infinity war  endgame and no way home were the only good things the last few years. some were pretty fun though.
jason todd is my all time favorite too.
why cant we have super man vs black adam  or dark seid  or doomsday  batman v superman didn t count.
lies  lies  lies.... gunn and co. are pulling the rug out from under the fans and actors.
I checked out of the dceu
he s definitely lying  I hope his movies tank.
oh good that one person who s name I cant recall and who s character I dont know is staying ! thank goodnessI think they will recast many of them as black or other races it will be anything other than white because thats the shit coming out of hollywood
I gotta disagree. I cant stand affleck. I wanna know if harley quinn is coming back! margot robbie nailed it!
Im looking forward to see the financial downfall of wb   dceu
the dceu is finished mac go boom.
gunn is a hack!
just dont see gunns dcu films  and let that be a huge statement of your displeasure to discovery s ceo.
I dont like when they mess with original content its just so so wrong   and never really  fits the character    on the big   screen
matthew 18 7 woe to the world because of the things that cause people to stumble! such things must come  but woe to the person through whom they come!meaning if you  drink  in front of a recovering alcoholic or wear  revealing  clothes in front of someone thatstruggles with porn  woe is you !!!
doomsday has some history with kryptonians     thatshould be a movie
thats already happened.wb is 2.3 billion in debt.
you made a video about not being responsible for other people sinning  here you go.
dc needs to stop everything for 5 years then restart.  I am tired of superhero movies so I dont care of dc and marvel keep failing.  I find it funny.
except for that complete wackazoid miller the dcu did not lack quality in the acting department.
recasts everyone but the 2 people he should get rid of. ie amber heard and ezra miller
watch  they will keep ezra after they got rid of cavill and co etc  gunn is f cking dead to me. im never paying to watch any dc movie ever again.
Im a dceu cheerleader but I say reboot it all and ignor the fans completely...  social media screwed the dceu up not wb  everyone with their hashtags was the problem and wb did actually listen! think about it everyone bitched about man of steel bvs and suicide squad and started the fire snyder hashtag and make it like the mcu hashtag and what happened... they fired snyder and brought in the avengers director to brighten up justice league then all the woke nonsense crept in amd ruined birds of prey and everyone loved them killing letto joker then the hashtag snyder cut started and boom 4 hour cut of justice league on hbo max and people loved it with letto joker scene being everyone s favorite part! people loved  the batman  and through a fit over ww84 that wasn t that bad btw  now look what happened wb want to move forward with  the batman  and joker universes then after batgirl gets scrapped and black adam bombs wb starts to completely wipe the slate to start over then the hashtag restore the snyderverse starts back up! dc fans are the worst and need to shut their fuckin mouths because they fucked up the dc movies not wb the actors or directors... now if their plan is to reboot just for soyboy jon kent or black superman just to be diverse and inclusive then screw dc thats on them!
gal gadot is way too sexy to be replaced as ww . thats it Im boycotting all superhero movies until I get a proper dragon ball z live action
I dont like either the batmans battfleck or the new guy. neither hit me I dont know why.
dont care.  they dumped cavill so  I ll just watch classic dc.
keep using the word woke no mercy.
honestly  dc is a mess
of course this is all grift if you fall for it its like shades of goodfellas what the f    is so funny about me huh tell me what the henry do tommy the f    out of here you ain t going to catch me thats what this is about he s catching people she s smart Im smart and the ones who know dont let him catch you with it dont for for that trick it was done in the 80s and 90s even before that time
sounds like a movie I wont be watching. I cant believe thats there excuse for re casting all of justice characters. its call hair and makeup. if they also change aqua and wonder women it will just set in stone me not watching it. I think gal gadot was a good wonder women and she should be playing the role along with henry and ben and the rest of characters. to top if off with all the woke agenda bs im just done with all movies
gal wont be touched in the role.we know why.to bad we most likely will get more marvell direction of for dceu.
if we dont get henry back I truly am done with dc. I will watch joker 2. that is it.
I think its about time we all stopped watching these stupid movies anyways  they re just a tool to brainwash you at this point
get ready for james gunn  supertrans  henry was too masculine and isn t into little boys like gunn is..
@meloniemacgoboom
david corenswet for kal-el. period. jason momoa dont look shit like aquaman  recast him.
good. the snyderverse was horrible and clearly they had no understanding of these characters. at least gunn is a competent filmmaker.
james gunn can not afford to pay anyone 20 million dollars for a movie  new actors are cheaper and its easier to make a. movie for 70. to 85 million than 225 to 300 million
bye then. cavill is gone.
representation! yay!  not really.  almost all the characters being replaced are white or heterosexual.
melonie I gotta push back at you. henry is a good superman  but the best  I still think Christopher reeves is the best.
james gunn can be a bit of an idiot  then hollywood has lost the plot with being obsessed with remakes and re-doing origin stories  or doing films on  real life  hollywood people  that we dont really need to see. there are no real original movies from hollywood  just rehashes and remakes  you have to go to independant or non-usa movies for original films.
didnt even know hes doing stuff with dc and not marvel  at this point tho its time to stop watching capeshit
james gunn s a creepy dude.
I just do not care anymore about superhero movies. dc or marvel....I dont wanna know they bore the hell outta me.
for me its the sameno sups no dcsorry but not sorry jamesand that also includes no guardians 3 for megoodbye
gunn said no cavill because he wants to go with young version Im calling it now it will be superman s gay beta male son because it fits their narrative.
these people  that call themselves  dc fans  are only snyder suckers  that are as ignorant as he is  about all things dc. its better that they recast everyone  and start from scratch. gunn confirmed everyone is getting recast  but his suicide squad cast  so  we re still going to see john cena hahahaha. jason momoa was poorly cast as aquaman  he should be lobo instead.
no fans  no business  no adoration  no stellar lifestyle  no kissing each other at award ceremonies  no money to indulge your woke ideology. remember the little people
how was arkham knights woke  I didn t play it or keep up with itsince itseemed shite from the announcement.
jason is an awful aqua man. he plays himself not arthur
I want to ask you one thing. if you are Christian  why do you have tattoos also  its really uncommon to me seeing this kind of girl being Christian.
recast the dceu  how about recasting the industry. I think that ll fix things better.
do people really care  some stuff set aside  I think a lot of us are just burnt out on superhero stuff.. there isn t enough diversity of content in hollywood right now and most these superhero movies all feel the same
james gunn is a slimeball. I dont trust a word he says and he s already managed to destroy any interest I have in his dcu. do we really need yet another superhero origin story  no! much less yet another superman growing up story ! definitely not! we wanted a good superman movie. we wanted a good justice league movie. we dont want more edgy hipster reboots with all the diversity  inclusion  and equity talking points programmed in. we dont want a black superman  we dont want a soviet superman  we dont want a non-binary flash  we dont want a samoan aquaman  we dont want an incel riddler  etc. the only reason they are doing a superman coming of age movie is so they can compete with tom holland s spiderman  but thats what shazam is for! if I wanted to see superman in his awkward teen years  I can watch smallville. dc is 14 years too late to the party. the superhero cinematic universe ship has sailed  its not new  and too many bridges have been burned by the studios deliberately. even superman cant carry this much baggage  and definitely not young superman!
amazing casting  most wasted cast in history - the only good dc movie since nolan has been joker.
maybe if you made movies instead of twiddling your thumbs  you wouldn t have to worry about actors in their 20s dying of old age.
jason momoa needs to go he just plays himself with aquaman powers...  its just as bad as the rock as black adam.
no one but gunn wants this bullshit. no one wants to see black superman.
how is he creepy
trueee
Im boycott all this movies  I enjoy the man of steel  even batman vs superman same thing with marvel I hated thord love and thunder
gal gadot cant act anyway she is no big lose
henry cavill is a great superman   but   superman as a standalone character  just sucks for film. not many stories can be told.
babe
dceu is terrible...so james gunn is doing the right thing.
mamoa is a fun actor but a crap aquaman. he would be perfect as lobo  but not someone serious like arthur.
first
fourth
the suicide squad  1 and 2  are crap. 5 10
dceu was bad but now  with james gunn  it will be toxic trash.
good I hope james gunn recasts all the cast from the dcu. I hated all the actors. jason mamoa cant act anyone else can play aquaman and these characters.
james gunn sucks for action movies he should do nickalodeon or sumthing
I dont care about jason momoa that much because aquaman is supposed to be aryan caucasian looking character. no offense . but I do care about henry cavill being fired. and the  rest I dont care about . but its just going to be a replacement to sell woke obviously. if it happens. but aren t we tired of reboots to sell woke .
who cares about the suicide squad
viola davis has no place in the dceu. she s not welcome. Im disgusted whenever I see her now. she s revolting to me. now that Ive seen her woke side its sickening.
so of course he is keeping his trash the suicide squad movie was a failure and sucked
they should make the new cyborg a gay butch white woman
nobody cares anymore.....thats how trash the entire genre has become.....
always love your takes and the honesty. but raceswapped aquaman and scrawny wonder woman   really  cant agree with that.  they can do better.
I agree with you a lot but pls move on from henry cavill. that man is done with super man and nothing you can do. I believe what james gunn has  planned for us is going to be epic. this man never lets me down  from guardians of the galaxy to the suicide squad.
gadot was perfect as wonder woman.get off the crack son
is doing parody movies!!
lol  suicide squad and peacemaker said differently.both miles better than what we had till now.
@dcmastermind first  I find that worth less than a filled diaper  lol
lots of people.
oh so very interesting. an evangelistic tattooed dc nerd gamer youtuber.. nice
dc is dead. another reboot. the average viewer are locked on marvel when it comes to superhero movies. marvel owns that genre. dc at this point is just trying to stay alive. because they know they ve been irrelevant for almost decades. and the only thing thats making money for them is anything with batman in it. dc should just file bankruptcy. dc is dead burry it.
wow  so you defend a guy thatsupported the riots  sad.
firejamesgun  boycottwb
james gunn out here calling fans toxic like we dont remember his pervy azz tweets about little boys.  canceljamesgunn
you sounded pretty good until you started sounding like a q anon member...implying politics into everything
can we keep politic out of entertainment also  Jesus.wtf
please. marvel is nothing but woke trash now.dc has by far the best characters and stories not marvel.
@dcmastermind first  if you say so  explain the box office numbers in recent dc movies  they barely can make any profit
@alvinwazhere  what box office numbers  phase 4 has tanked hard. not even wokanda forever could hit a billion.thor 4 was trash as was black widow and the rest too.and captain marvel made a billion aswell. still trash.just because a movie makes alot means nothing.
@dcmastermind first   just because a movie makes alot means nothing. then why are they rebooting the dc universe  the bias in your words man. in this business money is the number 1 thing. you can say phase 4 sucked. but a bad marvel movie makes more than a successful dc movie and thats sad. like the recent dc movies can barely make profit to continue this shitty so called dc universe. nobody cares about their characters  nobody is hyped for anything that dc releases. marvel owns this superhero movie genre. dc is just trying to stay alive and pray that a 1 hit wonder saves their ass. like how aquaman did it even when the movie was just average. and the joker which is their 1 hit wonder. after that tell me what other good movie they released  the batman  people calling it a masterpiece  couldnt even crack a billion. during the pandemic spiderman nwh tripled the batman s box office. thats sad. im telling you  dc is just trying to stay relevant. and whats funny is they are doing lots of screen testing with their upcoming movies. way more than usual  you know why  they dont even have confidence with their films. flop after flop. than spending money making these shitty dc movies id rather save millions of lives that matters.
@alvinwazhere  thats just plain wrong.a bad marvel movie makes more than a good dc movie  incorrect.suicide squad alone proves your statement to be false. even with a 26  rating itstill made 760 million and took home an oscar for makeup.thats better than all of phase 4.so I think you d better rethink your logic pal.and dc is rebooting because the films are simply not making enough money anymore. black adam barely scratched 366 million. in order to break even it had to at least hit 400 million. the rock insisted it made 50 to 72 million in profit but the studio decided thatsimply wasn t enough. marvel on the other hand keep making sequels to garbage films like eternals. complete trash in every way... so I think wb are making far more intelligent moves in that department. thor 4 was also a flop. so bad that the director was fired too.and dc characters are the biggest characters in comic history. dc had shazam 2  flash  blue beetle and aquaman 2 coming. all far better than anything marvel has in 2023. thats ant man 3 and guardians 3 which is the last one.... after downey jr and evans departure from marvel nobody cares. black panther was the last big movie and wokanda forever sucks. marvel has nothing but woke trash now.and youre false again.wonder woman was huge making 880 million  aquaman made over a billion  joker made over a billion and took home 3 oscar s too. far better than marvel since endgame.the batman made imdbs movie of the year and has been put forward for an oscar and 12 saturn awards which is a record. so tell me again how dc has nothing and I ll laugh my head off as I have done with everything you ve said.and the batman didn t was a first entry film for a trilogy. no batman first entry has ever cracked a billion. in fact the batman broke nolans batman begins record and reeves 2nd batman film will surely hit a billion no doubt.and no way home was the final instalment of the spiderman franchise and sony not marvel.so disney only got 25  of the profit.spiderman is not counted as a marvel production and never will be as long as sony owns the rights to the character.also the batman got a higher rating aswell.thats a perfect 10 from ign alone who called it a masterpiece.no way home only scored 8.so once again batman beats marvels best.
@alvinwazhere  oh and I almost forgot.the sandman which is a dc production on netflix also destroyed all the competition and was declared a masterpiece.not to mention itscored 1.4 billion hours of viewing time making it the most watched netflix show ever.let s see marvel touch that
@dcmastermind first  man of steel  42.7 millionbatmanvsuperman  105.7 millionsuicide squad  158 millionwonder woman  252.9 millionjustice league  -60 millionaquaman  260.5 millionshazam  74 millionbirds of prey  -50 millionww84  -170 milliontss  -170 millionbatgirl  -70 millionblack adam  -50 milliontotal profit overall  328.8 million yikes  no wonder why dc is heading for bankruptcy. your really gonna take ign s rating seriously. they can have that rating  but show me how much they made. and why arent they continuing that timeline  ohh its because it doesnt work and the average viewer isnt invested in these shitty characters. youreally think the sandman series impresses me. you want to talk about smashing records. in the top 24 most grossed movie in the world  marvel has 8. dc  none. and your really trying to exclude spiderman nwh it has a marvel tag on it. try reaching that achievement. which dc will never achieve. they are just picking up marvel scraps to try to stay alive. hiring joss whedon  hiring james gunn  hiring alan horn. like they are literally trying to stay alive with marvel scraps. I dont even know why you are trying to defend a dead company. already rebooting the franchise again made the fanbase not care about dc anymore. as we are about to witness another origin story again.
@dcmastermind first  I literally told you how much profit they made and it isnt enough. so your really gonna listen to ign  the same company that rated she hulk higher ranking than black adam. and the movies you mentioned  3 of those movies supposed to hit a billion higher  wonder woman one of dc s most iconic characters. couldnt even crack 1 billion. batmanvsuperman the faces of dc comics. 2 legendary characters and yet 600 million. ouch. talking about those 2 characters should easily make 1-1.5 billion. joker was a good movie  and here we go with the batman. another batman. couldnt even crack 1 billion. the flash winning honorary oscar.  you know there was 2 other marvel movie in that vote. zsjl  spiderman nwh and endgame were the top 3. ill guarantee you if it was just 1 marvel movie it would outvote zsjl.I have zero argument  you still couldnt tell me why they had to reboot the damn franchise again. all you do is bring old dc movies and useless tv series that nobody cares about. and it has nothing to do with their current state. if dc was better and all that like you said. explain me why they have to reboot  explain that. your in the business to make money why is  highest grossing  a problem  the more money you make  the more content you can make and the more profit you make. like I said before warner bros dont even have the confidence to release the movie with no problem. they have to cancel batgirl because it had terrible test screenings have multiple test screenings  more than usual  for the flash  aquaman and shazam 2. overhyping a shit movie like black adam. is there a black adam 2 coming out  nope because they dint make much.endgame sucked dick  well let me tell you something  if wbd dc stayed with zack snyder their finale ending of his dc movies will end like endgame. theres even a storyboard of it. jl 1 they defeat steppenwolf  realized theres a stronger being out there  jl 2 they take the fight to apokolips and loses to darkseid  jl3 knightmare world then flash runs back in time to fix a few things then you have the justice league vs darkseid and his army. tel me that doesnt sound the same as infinity war and endgame. so your basically calling the dc version dogshit too lmfao. your soo bias
she s literally said nothing about politics
@dcmastermind first  she literally brought up  wokeness   which is a political buzz word. I enjoy movies for what they are. and now itseems like every time a movie comes out someone says that they are being woke   or there s some hidden message. Imean damn. is there really an agenda in everything. Ive watched hundreds of movies and even if there is an agenda  no adult is going to change their mind.
no way  dude. Jesus is the message everyone needs to hear. in fact  kicking God out is what helped contribute to this woke cesspool we re all dealing with. without an unchanging  transcendent moral foundation  man self-destructs into wicked perversion. Jesus is the cure for that.and besides  its melonie s channel. she can discuss whatever she wants.
