so  they fired a guy for doing exactly what he was meant to do  that is like hiring someone to demolish an old building in your property  then sue the guy for trespassing and property damage.
it feels like amazon probably bit off a little more than they could chew with this one. the fact that the Lord of the rings is the 2nd most translated book in the world  behind only to the Bible  shows just how well loved this series is  and I dont think their perversion of it will go over as well as they expect.
anytime is great time to trash on the rings of power. these people dont care the lore all they care about is the message.
one of the great things about the jackson movies is that the costumes went far beyond what you could see. bernard hill said that his armour had patterns stitched inside it. this detail was never meant to be seen  and when he wore it  nobody watching would ever know. but he knew. and he felt more like a king because of it.that costuming for the new show is definitely a let down.
if this rumor is true  then from near the very beginning and conceptualization of this series they knew that they were fucking things up.  they knew that the true fans fandom would hate it.  they knew it wasn t going to be well recieved.  they knew and didn t give a single solitary shit about it.
nice job mel. the problem with amazon is they dont give a crap  the show runners and writers are eat up with arrogance they are smarter than anyone else  just ask them . one has to wonder why amazon paid so much for the rights when they are throwing it all out the window  oh it was to use the name only it makes perfect sense........
this guy is literally that meme character that gets thrown out of a company window after telling them something they dont want to hear
shippey isn t just a tolkien scholar. he s the tolkien scholar. this story seems old because I heard about this early into the production.
I for one will not be watching this show! I have better things to do then watching a show thatspits on tolkien s grave. great work mel! youre awesome! God bless!
hiring that lotr scholar in the first place must have been purely a pr stunt.  they never intended to listen to him.
dunk on rings of power. yeah definitely polluting the lure. I hope there isn t any inappropriate material. poor tolkien. that armor looks so bad. good verse mel and I agree with you on that about asking for stuff.
yes  tolkien was catholic. not this new age catholic like the former vice president biden. you cant find a better lore for its values and morals. to see them ruining his life s work is shameful. we need enough of us to not watch and hope they cancel the show after 1 season.
tolkien was super catholic. in fact  the whole lore is essentially a catholic mythos.
the george molho mentioned in the article has a great youtube channel  george the giant slayer  and he s a good friend and supporter of a lot of people associated with friday night tights.he s been covering the  rings of power  fiasco thats happening a lot.
seems to me like the rings of power consultant is the only smart individual in the room. the rest of them have no clue what they are doing with the franchise. lol
george is amazing  not afraid to call out things as he sees them  as he imbues every video with something from his life and a lesson to be learned from it.on another note  if you as an individual cannot connect to a person s works because of their beliefs  so long as its not something completely depraved  you are shallow and a bigot. muslim  Christian  buddhist  new age  and whatever the people who believe in the giant spaghettImonster call themselves  we should acknowledge that each of our beliefs is important and even sacred to us and as such we should respect each other s beliefs even if we disagree. amazon and the writers clearly aren t people who can see the multifaceted complexity that is someone else s beliefs and as such  it needs to be  fixed  or  updated  for a modern time.
love how they waited until after Christopher tolkien passed away to destroy his fathers work.
they had to wait til after Christopher tolkien died because he wouldn t let them do this  then they fired shippey for telling the truth. sadly this dumpster fire from amazon will still get a lot of views because of the name. side note  Im waiting to see melonie start taking a bite of butter at the end of these videos now.
I can relate to that guy. I tend to do good with any opportunity I can and if I am an expert in one way or another  not only am I disregarded by someone regardless of who it is half the time  I have been publicly ostracized and I prefer to stuff on my own than anything. not to mention how mentally agonizing to know so much  but also disrespected just as much just for the knowledge this guy know and people just ruining what he s known for years.also on a different subject I understand you have an open invitation on stuff like your discord  but even then I have a tendency to stay silent  because very few and I really mean very few are there in my time of need and even then it feels like they only do it when itsuits them.you just keep doing what youre doing melonie  but I am going to have to respectfully say that most of your groups minus this one  I am keeping at arms length  because you may say that there are good people  but I have only experienced the opposite of what is said. Imostly prefer to work alone because of many years of stuff like that.
I think I know what happened here... they wanted a token scholar.
Im pretty sure they did the same thing back when they were making sonic 06.  how dare you tell us the game isn t ready ! we re shipping it anyway!
I think they hired him for his name and asoociation  but then he told them 90  of what they re doing isn t accurate to any of the lore. and they didn t like that.
they just wanted to hire tom shippey to have his name attached to the show. tom was the lore consultant for the peter jackson Lord of the rings and hobbit movies. tom s involvement in those films  less so with the hobbit films because those films had to make stuff up to fill the runtime of 3 films  is a huge reason many Lord of the rings fans love the peter jackson movies. to be hyperbolic  tom shippey s involvement gives people assurance that the show is in safe hands  the only way it d be in safer hands would be to literally revive john tolkien himself. of course  since amazon and the rings of power writers had no intention of honoring tolkien s work  this strategy was never going to be successful. just a friendly reminder that amazon began production on their  Lord of the rings  show literally three days after Christopher tolkien passed away. you know... the guy who had the ability to veto amazon s trash  and more importantly  the only one at the tolkien estate who would respects john tolkien s art enough to do it.
they hired him for clout and to lend legitimacy. he wasn t supposed to talk.
I really hope not. lotr will always holds a special place in my heart.
I think they bought the name for the guaranteed audience. but  they never wanted to make a story like tolkien would have. they wanted their own story to rival game of thrones. jeff s missed opportunity. its why the trailer looks so much like got. so no  this wont by any lotr that fans know. its just generic fantasy with rings in the tite cause everyone knows rings associates with lotr. watch everything they ve been doing since buying the rights after tolkien s son died and couldn t defend it anymore  and tell me you think its going to be good and faithful to tolkien.
the costumers made clothes not costumes for the Lord of the rings. this is what made the movies feel real. as an extension to the story concerning bernard hill.  there were intricate designs on his clothes and he didn t want to ruin the designs by sitting in the costume so he went out to a local store and found an inexpensive stool and asked the crew if they could fix the wobbly legs so that he could sit between shots so that he wouldn t ruin the costume. when he got it back they had made carved legs with rohirric designs and a very intricately embroidered cushion. when he asked about it he was told that this would be a stool owned by the king of rohan.
pretty sure youre right. and really looks like they dont care or maybe even want to crap all over jrr
noticing patterns is antielfmitic!!!
yup
they know exactly what they are doing.
they aren t making this production to honor the man  but take his work and create their version of reality in middle earth. its like taking a raphael and painting over it to change the details to suit their vision. it is ok to try and recreate the original the best you can in a respectful manner  but amazon is changing details to  improve  the original work to suit them.
shows how sinister they are and another reason to reject them.
from what I have gathered elsewhere  they had to. Christopher would never have allowed this. and while he was alive had final say on adaptations and whatnot. the family that controls stuff now just wants the money grab or possibly agrees with  the message.
are you seeing a pattern
noticing patterns is antielfmitic!!
I think we re all waiting for the butter now!
right on!  this  rangs of power   is a farce to what the original tolkien s books were about.  there are plenty of cosplayers that can craft costumes way better then that.  if youre interested I recommend checking out shadiversity s deeper look video on his knight s watch channel. it was really good and he knows his stuff.
melonie mac go es  boom with yet an amazing video featuring a review on a trending headline - I guess the writers of rings of power are firing back with the wrong canon....also  kudos on the verse of the day
ex - core- e - ate  basically chew them out and chastise them.
just finished watching the vod of the latest simpcast  was the funniest one so far in my opinion  and now I get this. today is a good day. rings of power is going to be a garbage dump on fire  will fail epicly  they will lose a ton of money and they will blame the fans ofc. we all need to dunk on this show every chance we can. I hate that tolkien and his work is being disrespected.
I think this is what happens when someone is supposed to rubberstamp but doesnt.
but as the theme progressed  it came into the heart of melkor to interweave matters of his own imagining that were not in accord with the theme of iluvatar  for he saught therein to increase the power and glory of the part assigned to himself.
did people just think he came off the production because he wanted to focus on his hairdressing career  obviously he actually knew about the lore and was for sure viewed as of  problematic  by amazon for daring to inject tolkien s universe into rings of power.. imagine if they had actually listened to him  amazon may have had a show people want to actually watch.
monetize the disaster  melonie! we ll tune in for every new video. we ll make your bank account go boom.
to be fair  set shots often look much worse than later in the film  due to lensing and lighting and such. what s weirder is why anyone would bother to have an under-armor that was exactly the same as the over-armor  if they were going to silkscreen an undershirt  itshould have looked different. preferably something that wasn t going to look like metal is wrinkling!
hundreds of millions they ve supposedly spent on this show  and the costuming and set dressing look like a tv fantasy series from the 90s. if I were amazons accountants  I d be asking serious and pointed questions.
galadriel is not a warrior. just keep her a mage as you said melonie. I love it.
dear melonie  that amazon show should be called  the wrongs of power  the word is pronounced as  ekskoriate  and it means to heavily critique blame.and yes  j.r.r. tolkien was catholic.
hImelonie sorry for being late youtube didn t let me know.anyway more importantly thank you for sharing your wonderful thoughts onhot topics lol.takecare melonie
bezos needs to send in some auditors to account for the cash
well I wasn t gonna watch it anyway. Im just here to support mel with a thumbs up.
omg you are the whole package
apparently alphabet is trying very hard to crash everything they touch  so they re...  incentivizing ... youtube creators to make yt shorts and streams. basically they re trying very hard to compete with tiktok and twitch. if you start making shorts  to keep your channel growing  thats fine. but... if youre going to do half-and-half  which is what most people are doing   let us know which secondary alternative site youre using.  rumble  etc. Im just saying that if alphabet is going to try hard to destroy youtube  then they might succeed. its best to be on the ball with such things. let us know.
Im getting my tendies ready for this dumpster fire.
they never intended to make anything lotr. they just wanted to dress up their own stories in its skin so people would pay attention to their otherwise unremarkable work.
you have nice eyes. I know you from simpcast. I am not a simp  I just watched it for entertainment. you all are bunch of fun girls.
like tolkien shippey is a professor of english at a uk university leeds .
bless
I had to refresh the browser...for once melonie talked bout something that is not lara croft related...lolamazon prime bastardization of lotr is simply unacceptable...horrible..yeah  Bible verse is back!
ugh. I kept glancing up at my book shelf while I watched this video. so sad when you consider the gold mine of lore that already exists.
every time I hear more about rings Im like yeah no. I ll stick with all the prior movies and books. sorry amazon but ya blew it. blew a clear easy win
I guess this proves where amazon s priorities are at... rip lotr.
lol! that thumbnail!
according to ed powell  jrrt would not approve of lewd and lascivious conduct.   ed is calling around to see who is responsible
rings of power is a brand new set of original  content  for a  franchise  that will be using the pre-established framework of tolkien. it is a co-opting and a hijacking and it is not tolkien. the only reason its getting any attention or any credibility is because a corporation had a whole lot of money. I hope that people dont get fooled when they hit hard with marketing at comic con and upon its inevitable release. hopefully it will get rejected like a bad implant.
polluting  is a great way to put it.
well  there is some good news at least.  in the latest interview  they changed from saying amazons rings of prime was an  adaption   and now are saying its  inspired by .  biggest difference    inspired by  means it cant be canon by definition.  inspired by  makes it no more canon than your typical fan fiction.
amazon want s it own game of thrones  but they choose to cheap out on sets  real armor and weapons. mr. jackson asked all the new zeeland blacksmith to create all the armor and weapons  took 3 years but it paid off.
yea  its all about identity politics now  its more like   the rings of women power   bow as gary pointed out  also I would love to see you on fnt ine of these days
apparently franchisees just dont care anymore. its a shame
8 35 wtf that armour    how are you as a production group proud of this
we definitely are to ask God for things. matthew 7 7  ask  and itshall be given you  seek  and ye shall find  knock  and itshall be opened unto you  so  yes do ask.
the more money they lose the faster they ll learn  hopefully this show will be a total disaster.
boomers is the best kind of fallout new vegas faction.
rings of power looks totally doa. sad because I would love to see faithful adaptations of other parts of tolkien s work.
its pronounced  ex-kor-ee-ateI think they hired him to put lipstick on a pig.
here s an idea. since they re going for a got ripoff  why not call itsomething entirely different and change the writing up just a smidge so it doesnt involve that cursed ring and have no affiliation with lotr whatsoever. respect the fans and maybe even get a few more viewers.
1 43 george!  he s got a beautiful soul
this isn t the first time someone s tried to sleaze up lotr. john boorman s infamous 1970s screenplay was loaded with sex scenes and bad innuendo  including frodo and galadriel getting busy. this isn t anything new.
I was on fnt in march
@melonie mac go boom  again
the franchise doesnt have any adgenancy   only the corporations that buy the rights  or pretend to have the rights as is the case with lotr amazon
the extruded beloved classic-alike content must flow.  -- the creed of the content farms
ive seen the original Lord of the rings trilogy 20yrs ago as well as the hobbitseries. not once was there ever a scene of nudity in the movies. I have not read the books and im sure theres no explicit description of sexual acts or nudity in the books. look  I like naked women as much as the next guy but if the main focus is on the sexual acts and or nudity thats being promoted in the series than this is something thatshould be taken down from prime and moved over to hbo. this absolutely goes against the original source material and any smart parent would not let their kids see this. obviously its all about the money  the viewership and geared towards a certain demographic of audience.also  its 20yrs too late to take series like Lord of the rings in the direction of the mcu and dcu
tom shippey was fired for not only proving they breaking canon   lore but for also showing them where   when they were breaking the canon   lore of the tolkien world. they didn t like that   it did not match up with their soy-boy  wokier-than-thou ideology  so they fired him.
rings of power is pollution
is tolkein scholar an actual thing  Ive seen people on youtube have more knowledge of Lord of the rings than these so called  experts .
@9 10 this armor looks exactly like the blackfish s armor from got  but gold and made for a woman.
the irony I that find most humorous in this whole thing  is the fact that we have lotr scholars which is equally as ridiculous as one having a  degree  in gender studies. both contributing nothing of real value to the world  both specializing in complete fiction   both now mortal enemies. this is comedy that just cant be written.
yeah  tolkien didn t even like the rankin bass animated versions  and may have had his own criticisms of peter jackson s version. tolkien was a traditional catholic  and its said that he made quite the protest of the changes from the tridentine  or latin mass to the novus ordo  or new order mass. you cant blame him too much  since the latin mass and his close  near father relationship with the priest of his childhood  and just the whole outlook he had about escapism  especially from modernism. like many catholics  the mass is where heaven and earth meet  with the priest  as was tradition  facing ad orientum  to the east  to guide the people in attendance to Jesus. it can be called symbolic  but to a devout catholic  it is all more than mere symbolism. it is a representation with end goal being the source and summit of our faith in the eucharist  where we partake in the true presence of our Lord in the manner he set forth at the last supper. one cant separate tolkien s fiction from his faith. its from his faith that his fiction holds the greatest meaning. sure  the silmarilion has a rather pagan palette by which middle earth came to be. that was part of his studies in etymology. but even the very beginning starts with a father God that begets all the world into being. the great evil that eventually becomes sauron is portrayed as being crafty in music  much like satan is considered to have been a great musician who led the great choir in heaven before he fell. thus  much like Christianity  as the book of acts lays out  and st paul writes commonly in his epistles  about grafting in of the branches jew and gentile into the one tree - our Lord Jesus Christ. for to tolkien  the escape is not into a mere figment or pretense of the mind  but that which allows a person to break free from a purely modernist interpretation  but one that breaks one free to a realization that there is more to the world than just the materialist walls would have one believe. his ultimate answer to what is beyond those walls is God  by which one can find God and be within his presence within the mass.
sry Im super skimming by these days..!   ya do great work.
Im sort of hate watching wheel of time on amazon. have no idea about the story  never read the books so I cant be disappointed as to whether they adhere to the lore. but overall its just a cheap bit of fanfiction that is masquerading as a wheel of time spinoff. its looking like the rings of power is going to be essentially the same thing  generic fantasy fanfic  2022.
you have to follow the lore. amazon already ruined the show for me...
melanie talking about lotr...moaaaar!!!
you gotta follow the lore  you cant judge make up whatever you want. series lore has established canon.this is Lord of the rings not game of thrones
fired for stating the obvious perhaps
honestly melonie  this might be my worst take  but for someone like me who hasn t even watched Lord of the rings  despite the controversy  this show is going to be epic. do you know why its going to be epic  because of the production value and because  Im torrenting it in 1080p  sorry dont have a 4k tv. but I assure you its going to be epic. Im sorry that you wont be able to enjoy this.
geooooorge!!!
the british people were completely shafted in their own nation s mythology. social justice people are always trying to protect small cultures and making the  cultural appropriation  argument and here they are committing that exact same offence.
well to put nuduty in the show in a way tolkien may aprove the nudity would need to be link to bad behavior  and bad people like for exe in the Bible the wife of putifar try to seduce joseph   or dalila using her feminity to try seduce sanson so he tell her his secret . so they could put a evil woman trying to use nudety to do some evil but I would be surprise if they did that.
the sad part is the  normies  are going to eat this crap up.
the h in george s last name is silent.
hey melonie I just want to say thatso the company fire the guy for what he was doing but they are not giving him second chance to work with them again  anyway what the point of that  I just dont get it. anyway I also want to tell you that I will not be watching the ring of power bc of the boring reviews and I just dont want to waste my time on this show anyway  ok melonie. anyway I just want to tell you that and tell you that I just dont get on why the guy was fired for what he was doing and they wont take him back to work for them again. anyway I just want to tell you that  ok melonie. I hope you have a wonderful and great blessed day and evening at home with your pets and have a good night too melonie.
Im a tomb raider scholar so I cant judge
how can you say the production value is high when she just showed the promotional photo of a shirt printed to look like scale mail
you keep using that word.  I dont think it means what you think it means.
party barn armor. thank you have a great day.
can you call out the resident evil show next
tom shippey was sacked months ago. he cant say anything due to his nda  which is why he s laying low...

ex-cor-ree-ate
I  ll stick to the books and biography of tolkien.
they are burning amazon money creating a show nobody wants  aren t they depressed
george  !!!!!boom
also  formed scale mail is pretty bad
what s his face literally broke his toe on set shooting a scene when he kicked a helmet. her armor looks like molded plastic. thats not even how scale works.
76 30
thatsounds about right unfortunately.... no there were no black dwarves! .... fire this bigot immediately!!!
not surprising. really shows you the disposition of these people. no desire to convey a true to the material show or honoring the creator or doing right by the fans  pretty common nowadays . this is a completely selfish and soulless production meant to steal money  yes I said steal!  from casuals and really from tolkien if you think about it. this thing deserves to burn in the fires of mt. doom.edit  actually  I dont think this is going to make much money  lol.
later gater.
some weird shit going on with comments I tried to blast the rings of power pretty hard and it looks like yt really didn t like it lol  so anyway I ll just leave this comment.... we dont need boobies in tolkienthat word was ex- cor-ee- ate which means to strongly denounce
the subscribestar link does not work
the show looks very cheaply put together too for a 500 million dollar tv show.
3 09  catholic or Christian  something of that nature...   aaaand theeere goes some religious expert  d I have spitted my water on monitor laughing... no offence  im atheist  amazing
5 40 to 5 58 that explains so much about what is wrong with the church and what leads to all the problems they have  you bottle that up and dont teach people how to handle it and it always  always leads to disasterlike if you cant even handle basic lust and learning what love is in the face of that just because your told its evil from the getgo  is it any wonder the religious are dying off. and this also explains why they took to making such an example out of tokens work  its the last form of that Christianity and catholicism still popular in modern culture that they cant hate onwhich with how insane they are just on a basic moral standing  even that is an affront to them at this rate  even though all it is  is a fantasy book written by a religious guy who lived through the first world war and used it as his way to cope with what he had seen. and is it any wonder why it resonated with that group of people so well after those two awful world wars  like they literally just lived through the battle of mordor in real life in their own war and had seen things that just seemed unthinkable by their sheer scale  and found solace in a fantasy book with the same beats and visuals they had actually seen and then this generation wants to rewrite it and pussify it because their too dumb to understand what those people went through and respect that.
do you actually eat sticks of butter  or are you just meme ing on people
I turn comment filtering off but youtube still does itsadly
worked when I just clicked it  where does it direct you
well it would give me an error  showing that it couldn t reach the server for some reason  its working now!
haha! catholics and Christians do not identify with each other  but other people like to lump us together
@melonie mac go boom  I dont want to be nitpicky  didnt you mean catholics and protestants  I think that catholics are the coolest cosplay fantasy book fandom ever  but I still would count them as Christians...
I dunno why people think its so weird. butter is perfect for hitting ketogenic macro targets
@melonie mac go boom  Ive been sharing your shorts of it on facebook  and I just wasn t sure if youreally do it  or make the videos just to meme on people lol
hImelonie
at the moment of baptism  the Christian usually cant speak and cant even focus their eyes. so yeah  pledging anything in the name of others is just meh.
yeah nobody cares about ndas.
yet another show I will never watch.they ruin everything.
this galadriel is gross. its a joke compared to peter jackson galadriel
trashing rings of power of rings of the rings of power is the only thing entertaining about this cheap knockoff of tolkien s work. hiring but not using consultants and eventually firing them doesnt surprise me as such people are great at wasting time and money.
its a rumor. really getting tired of folks posting video s based on rumors as if they are facts. in fact  I am tired of the media as a whole living off rumors.
Lord of the rings scholar   so  a nerd who reads and remembers things they ve read
noticing patterns is antisemitic
the article I read and myself clearly stated this was a rumor and never passed it off as fact
