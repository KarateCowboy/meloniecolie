also  and I keep saying this   I feel like winter soldier had the perfect blend of seriousness  stakes  and humor and I wish dc would have that movie s tone be their baseline and move accordingly based on each character s movie.
what I have learned about melonie s values 1 God 2 family 3 lara croft 4 everything else.
that was probably the most entertaining retelling of exodus I have ever heard and you managed to make the concept of idolatry relatable at the same time.  we ve all had those times where we take our eye off the ball. fortunately  God will be there waiting for us to return. thanks for sharing.
thor is my favorite mcu character  being a fan of different mythologies I was hoping that it d go more into both norse mythology and greek mythology since the villain is a God butcher
I think its clear in the trailer that the feminization is temporary as thor  finds himself  and gets in shape throughout the course of the movie  and he ll probably reclaim his strongest self or whatever by the end  mainly through the conflict with the female thor. itseems obvious to me that even in the trailer they re playing up the girly self-love self-discovery gimmick as tongue in cheek for a character thatstarted as burly and masculine  but who knows. what will really impress me is if they manage to make a movie thats not even  decent  with the guardians of the galaxy in it
I love the talk abot the scriptures  it was totally relateable. I still struggle with all the distractions that this life has to offer rather than  to look to God in every thought.  keep up the great content!
I think the only female version of a character done well was she-hulk  and only classic she-hulk. not the new one.the original she-hulk was an interesting character who had her own things to worry about besides just being a girl hulk. even her powers worked a bit different. her comics had a different feel and she had a totally different vibe. she was like deadpool in her comics  where she broke the 4th wall regularly. I used to think thatshe deserved her own show or movie  but these past few years makes me hope she stays dormant until the woke craze dies out.modern writes just cant write good female or minority characters  they are too desperate to turn them into corporate tokens and they make them hollow characters.
as a teaser  it did its job showcasing the visual concept of the movie. once the story trailer drops I think a lot of people will change their tune. hopefully they do the villain justice.
my favorite part of today s verse was moses throwing the tablets down and yelling  what the crap  dude !
you should definitely watch the movie when its released  reason why is because this has the guardians of the galaxy in the first part of the movie which they always have funny scenes and Christian bale as gor is going to be epic and the fact they are introducing norse Gods  greek Gods in one movie makes it crazy
while it wasn t shown in the prince of egypt  it is shown in cecil b. demille s the ten commandments  the greatest adaptation of the exodus story  100  recommend you watch it  that aaron was forced by dagan and the others to make the golden calf. it was either he do it or die.
very blessed to have your channel. it is so refreshing to see someone have a passion for gaming and movies while still loving Jesus and his word.  your scripture reading feels so genuine. and I appreciate how you dont hold back. it is true even as believers we have the tendency to put other idols before God without sometimes noticing. am I thankful for his grace and his willingness to wait for us to realize he is the only one we need. praying for you sister.  Im sorry your going through hard times.  Im sure many of us are. the only thing that keeps me fighting is that God s promise will never fail us. whatever that promise is for you  just know he will fulfill it. be blessed and hold on to those promises as God takes you to bigger and better things. just always put his kingdom first.  looking forward to seeing where that is for you.
thank you for the scripture reading and interpretation. you are an inspiration and encouragement. please keep it up.
I like how thor s out living it up after he off loaded the responsibility of kingship to black valkyrie and she looks miserable.
I personally think this trailer was Goddamn awesome. as long as they continue to make  jane her own character  I think it could be fine
you always have the most beautiful smile melonie!!! great reaction!! the only thing that I like about the thor 4 trailer is the guardians of the galaxy cameo!!
I liked the sets a lot. thats about it. I hope people who like thor and the mcu enjoy this one  but I dont feel any regret missing most marvel superhero films.
the only thing unrelatable in this video was the choice of color for your outfit  I could never pull off orange as well as you!  keep up the good work  girl!but seriously  I really appreciated what you shared from the Bible about the ancient israelites  and what you said about tomb raider.  I always find that my interests and hobbies are way more enjoyable when I am not putting them first  but rather God first.
I remember seeing natalie portman wearing a prosthetic arm that gave her a massive arm  which was early in the filming  what was the story with that  this was totally different that what her arm looked like in this trailer.
pedro pascal playing joel  does that mean they re eventually going to cave his head in
formulas always get boring.
I thought winter soldier was a damn jason bourne movie first time I saw it. awesome fight scenes
@master y  yeah  the winter soldier vs cap or black widow fights on the street or on the roof were so good. and winter soldier felt dangerous.
winter soldier was peak mcu in my opinion
1. lara croft2. tomb raider3. croft manor4. lara croft
I actually really enjoy the new she hulk minI now that they ve brought back the original she hulk. its only three issues in  but its been refreshing after years of... well  we wont speak of that.
@jetsetradio  I haven t seen it yet  Ive been to reluctant. their are few female characters I really loved that have been ruined. mulan being one of them.
x-23 was also pretty good and wasn t a replacement wolverine  until some woke writers caused that . she wasn t in marvel vs. capcom 3 for no reason.
agreed. jennifer or something right  idk haven t read any comic in years because they re trash but she s the only tokenized character that I think they did a great job on. everyone else sucks because they re literally just a reskin of the og but black or asian etc. or female. why would I read the discount version of wolverine or spider-man etc
I cant believe she fell for that. now  adventure!  -- thor
the thumbnail made me think of hawkgirl.  anyone remember her   she was awesome.  we ll never see a movie of her  of course  but she and hawkman were both independent super heroes back in the day.  they weren t a main and sidekick  they could both stand on their own and get stuff done.  if they were serious about strong empowered female characters  they d give her a movie  and they d bring back the old lara.
loved the humor. love zeus. hoping for a rough and tumble hercules
I really loved your breakdown of this verse! joshua for runner up mvp behind Jesus
praying for you
I just ran across you for this video s subject and about snapped my neck when you started talking about the Bible. love it. keep it up.
mm  what you said about  making idols  was thought provoking.  thank you.
the prince of egypt was such a great movie
I personally thought it looked good. was super skeptical before the trailer  but seems fine so far.
I absolutely love the Bible verse segments every episode. if you want to let a younger man take you on a date  31  that has no king but Christ. let me know! also  I agree on thor. Im a big fan of viking shows and history  and old time thor  and of course disney screwed up all the thor stuff.
I really enjoyed hearing that  I can relate to a lot about what you said
yes  melonie used one of my comments  how awesome is that! love yah melonie and keep doing what youre doing by being yourself and authentic!! oh and youre very welcome.
hey melonie! heard you say something about not being sure if people are getting anything from what youre talking about - cant speak for anyone else  but I definitely am. I just dont engage much with comment sections  so you ll usually not hear about it. recently Ive been tuning into your vids mainly for the Bible verses - other stuff is good too  but the teaching bit has been a goldmine. been going through my own wilderness and learning to trust is difficult but I know that I ll look back at some point and it ll all make sense. so yeah  there s at least one person getting stuff from what youre doing.tl dr - your vids have helped me a ton recently.
17 10 I got a chuckle from that.  reminds me of a comedy from monty python of moses breaking the tablets of the 10 commandments.  there were actually 15  5 on each.  there were 3 tablets.  2 survived.
didn t even know this trailer existed without ur video only reason Im excited is because of guardians of the galaxy
the two things I ll say  give credit where credit is due  natalie portman looks pretty good and did some work. I think thatstar Lord and thor interaction was more of a familial love. I dont think watitI was trying to make chris pratt uncomfortable or thor seem gay. Im mainly here for the villain. gorr is one of the scariest and better written recent villains when he was introduced in the comics.
I watched the ten commandments  1956  for the first-time last night. quite fitting verse of the day to coincide with that.
im not watching mando season 3 either. I am so glad to see other people care more about their principles than being entertained for once. often times people just continue to consoom and get stepped on thinking  what difference can Imake  what I do doesnt make a difference   but it does. it makes a difference to you and it makes a difference to God and when enough of us do it  it will make a difference to their wallet too I assure you. in this world our votes may not count because the system is rigged but how we vote with our dollars will always matter and have an effect. the ruling classes are leeches  parasites  they can only survive by siphoning our energy so always be mindful of what you are allowing them to siphon your energy towards. God bless miss mac and like another mac once said  you know how much you love it when you get it in abundance  we take over the world while these haters getting mad   -
Im done with m-she-u  but I think the movie will probably be funny. mostly because both chris hemsworth and chris pratt are naturally funny people and they usually keep the ad-libs in the movies. the funniest scenes in ragnorak were those where hemsworth and hiddleston were just screwing around.
I am going to pass on it.  working on my graphic novel to have actual new dynamic characters with interesting characters.  it will be called  final night  and will have over 100  pages to it.  an alternate pocket dimension where cryptids and ghosts from around the world attack an 1855 california town.
looking forward to seeing the movie and thor lost a lot of that weight he had.
she was cool in the old justice league cartoon as well
@vee clash  I hate to have to agree  but youre right.  they ll do exactly that and I guess in a way Im glad they ve not noticed her existence.  not looking forward to the day they do  if ever that comes.
yeah it had nothing to do with romantic love when talking about looking into the eyes of the people you love. if you think about it  thor has no family left  it would make sense for him to try to cling to others to get a little something back that he lost.
the eu is better anyway. katarn  jerec  desann..
I wish we could get a serious marvel movie like logan again
I dont know. I am ok with it as a teaser trailer. its about what I thought it would be at this stage  first look . my main issue is just how much have they feminised him  is he just a joke and others do the graft while he plays it for comedy.
what the crap  dude!  might be my favorite paraphrase that I have heard in my 60 years. every time I get mad at the isrealites  I have to take a step back and realize I do the same in my own life. we all sin and fall far short of God s standard for us. thus the need for Christ.
melanie I love your channel I agree 100  on your take of this door we are witnessing the end of the mcu because even more so than before this thor is gonna get nerd jane foster as the mighty thor and be a better thor in thor ever was in the mcu and that really sucks
sure elon is  part of the club  but he is still doing exactly what I want someone in his position to do. if he is making all the heads of twitter lose their minds he is doing something good
joshua is your favorite character yeah  I thought of the story of joshua as the people s convoy circled around dc.
I hope they keep making these wamen movies.  the more people ignore them  the sooner woke hollywood will get the hint.
here comes 35k! lookin  good as always! my only problem you addressed. he is joke thor. it was okay in ragnorak  but it gets old.
best part of the trailer are the people who let chris p live in their heads for free having meltdowns lol
his armour gives me ww84 vibes.
taika hasn t failed me yet. I have hope.
I wonder if we ll get to watch history or experience it in heaven........ gotta have something to do for eternity!
I would accept a total reboot of thor where its all about beta-ray bill.
I loved 1  2 naw  3 was pretty good but I see ur point
I think it looks pretty good as a fan of the thor movies. I am surprised that natalie is  actually buff . all these femme warriors are always skinny  so this is surprisingly welcome. I ll probably only dislike it if they turn hemsworth into a side character in his own movie.
why didnt they do an brunhild movie that would have been dope
we all need a joshua in our lives moses is up on the mount for 40 days and nights and joshua was right there just a little lower on the mountain the whole time never left or anything.
Im kind of with you on this one. Ive watched the trailer twice now and Im trying to figure out what the movie is even supposed to be about. maybe when the second trailer drops it might win me over  but I cant say Im overly thrilled with this. which is sad cause I really enjoyed the last movie.
melonie! have you watched the chosen tv series  pretty good show.
im not sure if trailer is showing us a bad movie  or if its just a bad trailer. great song  but I dont know why its there. there was a lot of stuff in that trailer  and except for his jacket  doesnt really have that 80s rock air they seem to be evoking with the title card. and Im still not really over ragnorak  it was funny  but at the cost of my favorites hulk comic story line.
I would say the latter is clear from the trailer  but I could just be overly optimistic
they ll never get the hint. take cnn  for example or even some of the cw shows
I definitely have respect for her working out to fit the athletic look of a super hero. unlike brie larson lol. ill find a way to watch this movie but highly doubt ill pay for it.
good overview for this one. Ive got all sorts of mixed feelings between the  writer wars  going on with the big media machine lately. honest reviews are a thing I appreciate to see hear more than the established groups  who are more happy to be secure with big paychecks and titles but seem to be just checking boxes rather than genuinely writing.on the Bible quote of the day  good choice. not just because my name is in there and I like to hear you say it. Ive seen and experienced much in life regarding faith that I feared borderlined idolatry or even went right into it and have constantly battled to disavow its concepts for an understanding of what God is really about. Ive jokingly intentionally clich d borderline  as well  but have worried it would be misinterpreted. thats just a risk you run when youre trying to get a message out  though. it is refreshing to get your takes on things. thanks.
thor ragnarok was a lot of fun.  I liked funny thor.  since they have the same director  Im hopeful that this one will be enjoyable too.  Im still not a fan of recasting characters.  marvel has literally hundreds of characters.  I d rather they introduce a new female character from their lineup  rather than changing an existing character.  guardians of the galaxy wasn t a household name  but they made it work.  they could certainly introduce a new female character and make her fun and cool.
it looks woke as hell.
what the crap  dude !  -moses  exodus ch.32  v.21  mmsv  melonie mac standard version   17 15
the problem is marvel have abandoned the audience that liked the initial films up to and including endgame. now they pander to a new audience that will literally just get hyped over any old sh t because of  bruh  representation .
thor looked like penguinz0 in thatsleevless jean jacket at the end of the trailer.also  even if I was in a coma I would have chose hugh jackman over pedro pascal as joel.  not saying jackman is the perfect pick  but he is pretty damn close to it.
dont care for she thor or king valkyrie or whatever woke crap they re gonna push in this but I do like chris hemsworth and chris pratt and their interactions in avengers end game were hilarious  so I will watch it to lmao at those two.
how is someone being able to pick up thor s hammer a big deal when literally everyone in the mcu can do it
you should watch thor darkworld  good movie.
we all face the danger of our hobbies crossing the line into idolatry. there is a balance to be achieved. keeping the faith is a constant struggle in all we do.
so she watches a trailer where the lead character has lost all his friends and family  gone through major depression  used food as a coping mechanism and now has come through the other side through healthy living  calls it bad comedy relief and then starts extolling the virtues of healthy living !
nice video like your vibe...new subscriber after watching you on critical drinker.
brolin would have been the best choice for the last of us  he looks like the character. easy choice for me.
that kiss with the blue hair is a message mel  and its a sad one
I feel like Im mostly done with marvel films  the only new marvel film Ive seen is no way home . I d been getting tired of the marvel humor and sameyness  I know its not a word  haha  for a while  and I felt like endgame was the perfect jumping off point. I felt like marvel really needed phase 4 to start off great for that reason  but a lot of projects feel like they re lacking heart or something like that.
david is my personal favorite - warts and all! probably because of the warts! to your proof  besides everything in egypt  there s this  exodus 13 21  the Lord was going before them in a pillar of cloud by day to lead them on the way  and in a pillar of fire by night to give them light  that they might travel by day and by night.  plus the daily manna  what more did they want and I ll never understand why God didn t knock aaron into the afterlife for the calf!  they made me   just doesnt cut it for me!
I think they should rename this thing   thor  lukewarm and blunder
hI @meloniemac   you are the farmer that is planting seeds.  keep up the faith  peace.
hey good morning and good late afternoon melonie. I just want to say that I have seen the first thor movie and it was okay and I have seen thor rangnarok movie and I thought it was better than the first thor movie but I dont think that I would not like this new thor movie coming out in theaters in july bc of thor being fat first beginning in the movie and turn around and getting skinny and thin again later in the movie and so plus having a female thor and sharing or having the same weapon like thor does in the movie that I think that this move would not be great and good than the first thor movie and other marvel movies  ok melonie. anyway I just want to tell you my thoughts on new thor movie  ok melonie. anyway I hope you had a great weekend over the weekend and I hope you have a wonderful   great blessed day today at the gym and have a blessed evening at home with your pets and have a good night and have a great blessed week too  ok melonie.
brave new world! soma for everyone!
what are you talking about   only 2 characters have lifted the hammer before this film.
there making thor more and more of a comedy character Im deeply concerned about this movie overall
alot of people show the intire trailer  without issues  o
watching mel breaking this stupid trailer down is far more interesting than watching the trailer itself.
mighty thor  jane foster is so badass mel!!!
awesome take on exodus 32  it is exactly like us to grow impatient with God and seek fulfillment in our own custom-made idols using our own resources. its also worth pointing out that moses intercedes for the foolish people of God despite their rebellion  which is a picture of Jesus interceding for his foolish people even now  1 timothy 2 5 its funny to me that you d think this could not be a help to anyone lol the inclination towards self-will in humans is one of the biggest things that draws us away from God  and any believer who is willing to be honest with themselves and redirect their trust toward God can always be helped by hearing a message like this. never doubt what God gives you as youread his word  melonie! his word does not return to him in vain  isaiah 55 11   it is living and powerful and cuts down to our deepest parts  hebrews 4 12 . thank you for all that you do    God bless
I also dont like when the female just get a hand me down title.  and its not like marvel doesnt have a truckload of female strong characters.  in the case of thor  since they have valkyrie as asgard kind and quite a lame character in comparison to the comics.  they could ve introduce angela.  since she was turned into an asgardian  sister to thor when disney bought them. a very strong warrior.  and since thor is with gotg it would ve fit.  I dont hate thor jane cause although clearly forced.  some of her presence came out good.  and the ending of her saga as  mighty thor  you could call it was nicely done.
I know jane foster 6 years ago when playing some marvel games but I dont know how she have thor powerlet see how marvel deliver this character
why would thor need to find himself   he is God of thunder.
well   bah humbug!
@9 45 seriously. how can anyone play through  or watch a playthrough  the last of us and not see josh brolin every time joel s face is on the screen. Imean  c mon. brolin should be the only phone call you make to an actor for the role of josh. and if he says no  then screw it. dont bother.
I think it looks good  there wasn t enough info to go off in the trailer for me to have a verdict but I do like the scenery. I dont pay attention to the cancerous marvel fan base though for a reason  they always go completely out there with their theories and its bizarre.
instead of replacing thor with a  womyn  they should have done a lady sif movie with jaime alexander. that would have been cool! also  I definitely get  wonder woman 1984  vibes with this trailer... and thats not good!
thor has to find himself again! after refinishing finding himself again for 5 movies.thor was my favorite character  now he s a joke.
pass but thanks for the video. btw  looking svelte today melonie!
since you mentioned gina carano in the vid  I cant wait to see her new movie coming out this summer   terror on the prarie .  could use a good western.
never judge a book by its cover  never judge a movie by its trailer. I know plenty of movies that had shitty trailers that were actually good movies  and I seen good trailers that actually were shitty movies. you can say the trailer sucked  which I wasn t big on it either  but whether or not the movie itself is gonna be any good  we cant say. something tells me this trailer was made to make it look like a happy fun time movie but with gorr the God butcher its gonna actually have its dark moments. I also dont see them trying to make jane as strong as thor  thor is always thor  mighty thor is only mighty thor as long as they have mjolnir. I never felt like the previous movies jane and thor had much chemistry  but I could kinda see how with everything thor has gone through and if jane goes through the same stuff as in the comics with cancer and all that how they d be more relatable to one another now on the paths to self discovery together. especially if both their paths and others lead to gorr. they aren t dumb  they sprinkle in woke stuff but they dont go overboard  many thought captain marvel would come in and show up everyone in endgame yet it was tony who saved everyone when thanos blasted her.
I thought the pirate lady part was a katy perry video clip lol
hugs . thanks again for your Bible readings  I always get hooked by the subject then stay for the meat of the message. I was a complete atheist for decades  but my constant research into the  interests  of the higher ups for an unpublished book on the ill umI natI led me to realise that they choose to make evil manifest by their free will rather than good. I felt a huge empathy in that moment for God who loves all his children but some of those children are confused and scared and easily led astray. I then had a supernatural spiritual encounter  which I remember completely   which in one nanosecond changed me forever and I sprinted to my local church and became a Christian on the spot.  now my church is in my heart and I carry it with me every minute .
wait til it comes on tv
when I watched it it felt like a bland teaser with sweet child of mine playing over it to seem more impactful than it actually is. it looked pretty. but Ive been done with disney for years.
that was my biggest problem this is about a guy killing all the Gods and it look like its going to be a comedy not like dark and thats troubling
bless  thank you so much for this comment
@melonie mac go boom  hang in there!! I know it gets easy to doubt ourselves  especially being surrounded by so much Godlessness  but  greater is he that is in us than he that is in the world.   1 john 4 4  us getting discouraged and giving up is exactly what the devil wants  but Jesus overcame the world  death  sin and the devil so that we cantoo
they dont want to do something fans could atleast buy into  they pick the worst character  nobody actually liked in 2 movies and then if youre not excited it must be sexism and being a hater.
you know jane foster becomes thor in the comics right
@underthegun897   yeah the woke comics that didn t sell
@underthegun897  and you know no one reads her comics
lots of shit happens in the comics  doesnt mean the movies have to copy.
@adam  they still are though and not in a good way
sadly true
@noah burch  2015 jane s thor sold 100k more copies than thor did in 2012 which was his last comic like at that time  according to my google search that was deleted from here
@underthegun897  comics became woke a long time ago.
@underthegun897  what does that matter  its still replacing a male hero with a token female.
@underthegun897  how many did itsold total just because itsold more doesnt mean itsold a lot
I dont like how they dont even show what happened to lady sif and they killed off thors other friends and he doesnt even acknowledge it...
so we got a female thor  she-hulk  x-23 as wolverine  kate bishop as hawkeye  another black widow  a female lokI  and another captain marvel.  you cant sit there and tell me marvel has gone full woke on their franchise.
@jarrett reynolds  yes they have you just said it replacing the male cast with female heroes that are better in every way
@jarrett reynolds  I would like to see a she-hulk come into play  who else is banner gonna be able to get with lol he needs him a woman. x-23 if it is played by the same one who played in logan I am down for that as hugh jackman played wolverine for so many years and he wanted to hang it up and who else better to pass the torch to than his own daughter.
@roach man  there is gonna be a she hulk that is already confirmed by marvel.
wooo a ben shapiro production... cant wait
I rather watch logan again then watch the last of us show. I always thought hugh jackman could play an awesome joel but oh well  at this point I couldn t care less of what hollywood makes now a days.
I think you missed a part of the trailer at the very end.
I disagree with you on the part about the idea that using crystals is a way to  replace  God. in my opinion  engaging with crystals is just one of the many spiritual methods that we can use to benefit us in different ways  as well as getting closer to God the universe nature Jesus. these are all part of the same thing in my eyes.
you could at least send me my ring back if youre going to refuse my proposal
I dont understand the point of a female thor when there are already plenty of interesting Goddesses in the norse pantheon to choose from.
pascal was awesome as the red viper    looks like he may be good in the cage movie otherwise  he s completely forgettable.
just pump in that guns and roses . is he still in love with jane   lol aaron  leave it to jeff goldblum to muck things up .
speaking of dabbling with the golden calf  when jeroboam rebelled against rehaboam  solomon s heir  to split off the other ten tribes  not counting the levites exactly  but many of them  too   of course he didn t want his people going to the temple for worship at the appointed times and appointed ways  but neither did he want them to stop worshiping yhwh  apparently for political purposes . so he reforged the golden calf and pretended thatsince aaron had allowed its creation  that this was a legitimate way to worship yhhw! none of the northern kings ever went back on this  whenever they led a revival away from baal astarte worship  most notably with jehu  they only went back to worshiping the golden calf as yhwh  along with multiple copies set up for convenience around the land  if I recall correctly .I ran across this in my Bible study for the first time during the past week or so  and hey Ive got a relevant opportunity to share it this evening!  g  appreciate your work and your witness.
why does chris hemsworth look like he just came from shooting the latest remake of point break
I find it odd they would even bring back jane foster  considering her character in the first two thor movies took up half the screen time  and really brought those movies down. why would you bring back a character that hurt your movies  only for them to take the mantle  it doesnt make sense. its obvious to me they only showed the thor parts to this film in this teaser  and will repeat what those two movies tried to do  and spend half the run time trying to sell us her character.  I love natalie portman  but the jane foster character in the movies just hasn t been working to being anymore than a background love interest.
I agree with you on the new love and thunder trailer.  it is missing something that the asteroid guardian of the galaxy and the last thor movies had but Imight see it just to see the 2 chris s  be goofy. they dont come off as woke I got to support that.
oh yeah  boom !!
jane thor is token   character  101. thor  isn t a mantle to pass on thor is his name. no one  would  pass on the mantle of bruce wayne over batman lol
animal protein!!!! I liked ragnarok but this trailer just isn t there for me. anywho  love your channel and verses you have on here everytime!! may God continue to bless u!!
I can see all the symbolism   thor lost his hammer he is leaning to his more feminine side   jane got his hammer becoming a more masculine character   but still they name her character  mighty  thor  instead of   mighty jane    valkyrie is named  king  instead of  queen   really shows that women dont need men   just their job and title .
we have been here before. the trailer heavily features the title character  come the end of the trailer we get who this movie is really all about thorette or thoress or whatever she is. this is another phase bore bait   switch.
I haven t followed marvel movies since age of ultron but Im all for guns n  roses tho!! lol
I actually prefer the first thor movie to the sequels because it has serious tones  an impactful story  real lighting  not orange and blue like many movies today   its quaint  and it has anthony hopkins not being a joke. of course I also really like quantum of solace so for similar reasons and people hate in that movie for no good reason so I guess Im just a bit of a movie apologist. melonie seems like something of an airhead so its no surprise she d go with ragnarok over the original but I also like ragnarok too so whatevs.
I am on the fence it is a teaser trailer I  am withholding judgement until the full trailer  which I dont think will be till after dr strange 2
your voice has a really really deep manly sound  no offense . seinfeld classic ep where on the ph  they mistook her for the husband. hilarious
her and thor never really had chemistry.  scenes with them kinda been meh.  unless she changes a bit I dont really care to see her again
@daniel n  they might be able to relate more now considering all the stuff thor has gone through and if they follow the comics with jane with her getting cancer they both would have just been getting out of rough patches and both be on the same path to discovering what they want and who they are now. me personally I would have preferred if they had just pushed for sif and thor to be together  they kinda wasted potential with that character and would make more sense for thor and sif to be together
ragnarok is great. I think the first thir movie is the mcu movie iv seen the most lol
@daniel n  probably the same for me unless you count the toby maguire spider-man movies cause Ive likely seen spiderman 2 more than any other movie.
@audiogardenslave  they aren t really mcu but that is good
thor s entire lore is a bloody mess from start to finish. movie 1  thor s powers are bound to mjolnir  including his phsyical powers. movie 3  only thor s electric powers are bound to mjolnir  because thor wasn t able to connect to his inner powers before. shifting thor s physical powers to what makes more sense  asgardian physiology. movie 4  jane is either going to be fully human with electric powers  as per waititI s own rules... or she s turned into an asgardian as long as she s able to wield mjolnir  as per the rules he intentionally changed...
love the red!
the story looks stale how long is he going to be  finding himself  again and again. he s supposed to be on the throne by now and being odin s successor with lokI dead.
she says it doesnt look funny it doesnt look cool it doesnt look good lol
after some pondering there is one word thatseems to fit thor these days. that word is in my opinion  lolcow  and that is kind of depressing. there is a right way of doing the passing of the torch story in which a female thor could at least get a shot  but itseems like we re not going that way.Im not even a comic book nerd  Im an anime fan and I still find this depressing.  why would a fan watch this
when you talked about how mankind seeks to replace God with a God of his own  it reminded me of how ideologies thatseek to take God s place become a religion to them. beliefs like communism  fascism  nazism  and socialism are all products of a debased mind. they try and fail to replace Christianity  creating great suffering and death in their wake. and even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge  God gave them over to a debased mind  to do those things which are not fitting.  - romans  1 28
if you were biking I would see you  jab jab jab
sigh..........this movie is gonna be a dumpster fire. it looks like it is gonna be bad and mark my words  they are gonna make thor and peter gay for each other and jane foster female thor and valkyrie gay for each other in this movie.......even though they are all straight.....but ya know  identity politics has been a continuous thing at disney for a good long while now. also  female thor did not go over well at all with the fans for the comics so it wont for the movie either and they blackwashed valkyrie for the cinematic universe which also did not go over well with the fans. not interested in this movie in the slightest. I hate it when characters get changed into something that they are not. instead of the woke writers ruining already established characters they should make new characters  but they wont. I liked the 1st thor movie  and loved the 3rd thor movie. the 2nd thor movie however was bad in my opinion.
soo I feel  meh about the trailer the comic book story behind how jane foster became  mighty  thor was really good but I do really dislike what they did in the mcu to thor I hate that they made him this soft comedy relief it is really bother some dark world which was the second movie was the last one I liked and even then I had problems with it
the most telling part of the trailer is the things said the least. youre going to get the female thor front and center of the movie for sure
I literally checked out of marvel since  endgame . anyway Im pretty sure natalie is going to replacing chris going forward. hope you and all the boomers had an incredible easter.
watch the northman trailer.and the golden calf s name is moloch
I feel the same about elon musk. I see all these videos of conservatives saying they re so happy about what elon musk is doing and how he s going to save democracy.but I dont trust elon 100 . I keep remembering when I d watch wwe and some bad guy would team up with a good guy. and right when they re about to take the tag team championship  that  bad guy turned good  would betray the hero and screw everyone. thats what Im expecting from elon musk.
melanie   based af
its the same director as ragnarok so there s some hope there. also mcu is definitely still going strong with no way home and mulitiverse of madness  why are people bitching  especially about morbius which isn t even apart of the mcu
natalie is definitely using a body double for her  thor  form. hopefully  it wont be revealed to be a man like with taskmaster in black widow.
feeding to algorithm melonie hI good work
the melonie mac on gamestop tv was like melonic mac mild salsa. this channel is melonie mac extra hot caroline reaper salsa. people like the hot stuff. I would love for melonie to make a short video of her grilling a 96 ounce steak and then eating it just to make the militant vegans lose their f-ing minds.
is elon supporting amber heard in that lawsuits
I find myself unable to be excited or even care about marvel products anymore. I gave lokI a watch and was completely disgusted by the horrible characterization and storytelling yet so many I know thought that it was awesome. thatscenario keeps repeating so Ive just stopped watching.spider-man  no way home was the exception. well done and probably the last good marvel film for the foreseeable future. I guess I have to start exploring anime or something.
the intention to make a-force is pretty clear
I didn t care much for infinity or endgame. no way home is by far my favorite mcu film. haven t really liked any other mcu films too much in years. strange will be great though  scarlet witch is the best mcu character actress in marvel films imo.
fun fact  moloch is the basis for molag  moloch  bal  ba al  in skyrim.
or she bulked up for the role.
@marcus williams  so I see you took my comment as some kind of insult  showing you are in fact not a comic book reader at all and therefore dont actually know that jane foster and her  thor  form are not supposed to be the same because  in the comics  jane is undergoing chemotherapy for cancer. which is to say  she is understandably very frail-looking. so if in the mcu she is buff outside of her  thor  form  it completely undercuts her character and development into the thor persona.
@mekagengar  well I have seen the behind the scenes pictures of natalie and she is buff now for the role. maybe they make here thinner with cgI if she has cancer I dont know.
@marcus williams  saw the photos. it looks like it may be legitimate but if true  it makes it worse as it appears they are removing the cancer aspect of jane foster s character entirely. of course  they could use cgI to make her look frail like with chris evans but they could have easily had her  thor  form be played by another far more bulked up  tall and athletic actress and natalie could have avoided training altogether and be justified since the thor form is supposed to be different similar to the hulk s. and well  we didn t see mark having to get ripped. lol.
have you tried ghost peppers  those are hot..
@dying rose  Ive had them and they are hot. but trinidad scorpions and carolina reapers are on another level.
@komradkolonel  oh yeah  forgot about those reapers..
I recommend my hero academia if youre looking for anime to watch
7 11 to be fair   I find almost every trailer bad nowadays  even when its a fantastic movie. mainly because they always follow the exact same cliches that just make me cringe. the fades to and from black  the pretentious  ding  sound effect  the booming or crashing sounds when something is supposed to be epic  the music being muted when something supposedly funny is happening on screen its not funny at all . but of course my reasons for not looking forward to this particular movie is something else  mainly being another formulaic marvel movie with a cast of characters I dont particularly care about.
the trailer just seemed really mediocre  especially compared to the ragnarok trailers which kicked assI dont mind jane becoming thor but she needs to earn being worthy of wielding the power of thor  sure anyone worthy can wield it but I think cap earned it
the idea of female thor as it was done in the comics was pretty good. the reason  in comics  was pretty serious. I wont spoil it here  but I hope they follow something close to the comics.but seeing the teaser trailer I dont think this will be the case... still itseems like a fun movie just like ragnarok was.
other than the guardians which are my guys ! didn t need it
Ive never liked she-thor purely from a cringe perspective.Im fine with natalie using the hammer. legit dont mind that.my problem is she takes thor s name.thor isn t a title. its his fucking name.his ex girlfriend steals his name after picking up his hammer. how can anyone be okay with that the outfit design is meh to me  but if it was designed to pay respects to thor  that would be one thing  but the comics pushed a massive anti-male theme so hard  its hard to see it as anything but  this small human woman can be a better thor .instead of us getting a unique fresh character who can use the hammer  we just get cringe.
I came to see a reaction for thor and ended up learning a lesson about God  and its great that you love God and youre a Christian but yeah  that is great  and about thor  well the trailer just music and  everything is just so uplifting  I think it gon be a fun film  and yeah keep defending your beliefs
I loved thor ragnarok but the trailers for thor ragnarok were good . the director is good no doubt about this trailer just looked goofy
humans are pretty hellbent to turn their back on God. like the first half of the old testament is God taking care of his people  them betraying him and the integrity he taught them  him saying  stop...  and taking care of them and then the second half is God eventually getting real salty with the jews constantly doing that  to the point he decides to use the jews to graft on everybody else and make them and the few jews who remain loyal his people.its why we need to commit the word to our soul and pursue a state of unending prayer. in the modern era  as soon as believers dont feel or see his presence  we tend to say  I accomplished this    I endured    I worked on myself  ignoring all the help we received from other humans and especially from him.
the best version of thor was infinity war. they constantly made him insecure with him always having to find out who he is
hImelonie  ill give you my opinion but as a stranger on the internet dont take it too seriously. I believe your love for lara croft is your admiration of the perfect woman who you might want to aspire to be. she is attractive  and able physically and intellectually. Imight be wrong but you could be confusing your strong admiration for the character with adulation. think if at anytime you denied God in benefit of your hobby. if so you are letting your hobby become a distraction from God. Imight even suggest  dont over study the Bible  practice it  the same way with your ideal self. you might not feel complete because you study the character you want to be instead of acting it. this was like a said a strangers opinion  Imight lead you wrongly so be aware. love your personality  you probably are closer to the character than you think. you might need some mma training tho xd
the rambling words and opinions of a child. wow  there really is a low bar for what counts as intelligence these days.
the king valkyrie thing worries me.
I felt absolutely nothing watching this trailer  and I couldn t be happier about that. it is so incredibly liberating to know that I have absolutely no interest in anything involving the mcu  star wars  or so many other franchises that have been killed and buried by failed-upward corpo stooges. so much time that I dont have to waste consuming this garbage. no fear of missing out whatsoever. I honestly skipped the second half of your reaction and went straight to comments verse of the day because I care so little about hollywood garbage now. this is a blissful state of being  Imust say.
maybe next time mm wear all red
thor is basically being pushed aside as the champion of asgard and being replaced by jane foster. odin has been replaced by an lgbtq black woman as the  king  of the norse Gods. thor is going to be a comedic goof. this is the all new all different marvel agenda from 2014 all over again. I wont be watching it.
attempt 323054 to stop mel calling us  boomers .
400 years in bondage and during all that time they kept the faith  but after witnessing the hand of God and a short trek across the desert  they decided a golden calf was the answer
the only thing I liked about the trailer was seeing the guardians.
nope I ll just go watch one with volume which is everything Ive seen except this one.
two words did it for me.  king valkyrie.  pass.
read the comics
she s gonna find her queen lesbian which is what the comic love and thunder is about so here s a lesbian romance because we are diverse
what have these people done to brunnhilde  why !
@gabr!el torres  look of what they did to angela from spawn and made her a lesbian also
@corey levine  stuff like this just makes me think of  how does it feel to live long enough to see your favorite franchises go down in flames
you know going see movie stop playing.
kinda tired of thor trying to find himself again. also not the biggest fan gore the God butchers design from the poster
I ll watch it because I like guardians of the galaxy and chris hemsworth  the she thor thing after this Im never watching another thor but make no mistake they re going to put a lot of woke trash in this
marvel movies are the cods of the movie world
even with natalie portman getting  ripped  itstill looks like she s got knotted string arms.   another bait   switch incoming!
ha! melonie likes hot sensitive daddy s! daughters lock up your single dads!
I guess Im in the minority of people who liked the first thor movie and hated ragnarok
woke up and watched the trailer   ngl  it looks fckn terrible fam. which is a shame bcuz I acc like the 2 chris  and a few of the castbut my boI pratt has the crazies reeing on twatter again  so that a w as always
if the hammer is enchanted then why would she need bigger muscles to wield it. is it because  otherwise a 120 lb almost 40 year old woman would look ridiculous
cool
they re making odinson pathetic while proping up the cancer ridden jane foster  female thor  thats why I dont care about the m-she-u or anything fizney.  duckfizney  my diet is that I eat very little wheat  sugar and only when Im hungry without pigging out even being at gatherings.  eatmeat and  eatcheese  moses was pissed very cool    verse of the day.
she man. thor
is melonie mac single and available  or single but not available  or is she on a plural status not singular anymore
I think the trailer looks amazing...ly mediocre.
I agree completely about the tokenizing thing they keep doing with white male heroes. they re only ever going to be  lady thor    black superman    miles morales ....itsucks for those characters
commenting to feed the algorithm
I agree.....its kinda dumb   Imean cant we just leave the character of thor as is. just leave it alone and keep the character the way it is. and when I say keep thor the way he is I dont mean gain 300 pounds and talk a bunch of gibberish and sound like some degenerate meat head
was never impressed with the hulk or thor films tbh. I personally have more interest in dcs next wave of films over mcus.
I dont hear anything from the trailer
I didn t see anything I liked in the trailer.  seemed like a thor season intro not a movie.
when does itstop being your  new channel    lol.   only asking because you have remarked on it before.
with the hair and beard and finding himself  he sounds like one of those annoying trust fund gap year students. lol
I think she s married to the Lord.
@dying rose  Im fine being in 2nd place. the Lord is always the 1st.
6 months or 50k subs  whichever comes first
wow she read my comment cool
pedro has been quite good in narcos. but  after  meh
the fat thor joke was good for about 1 scene in endgame  but they should have had his Godly metabolism kick in during the first fight   show him lose all that weight while throwing down.no one liked lady thor in the comics   no one is going to like her in this movie.
the female thor is cannon. and she was still just named thor. still  meh.....
didn t know the Bible had dude in it that many times proves what I know dude!
when I think female thor  I think smol jewess.
the batman trailer got me hyped  I watched itseveral times and ended up giving it a 9 10.so that whole  its only a trailer  retort just seems like a lame excuse.
not interested in joke thor or female thor
I saw all three of thor movies and actually enjoy his character. however I do not see the hype for this one. I was pretty disappointed with this trailer
I really dont watch movies anymore I just go play military shooters like insurgency sandstorm and other shooters Im ignoring hollywood its getting very old . melonie I recommend insurgency sandstorm if you enjoy military mil-sim shooters yeahyeyeyeye lit video very based  !
the wussification of thor.  woke thor  sickening.
equity thor... how exciting.
this was so bad.. im not sure what they are trying to do. from this trailer they are not going to hit with anyone trying to please everyone
I dont know I liked the trailer
this is why I quitsuper hero movies and shows years ago. a load of woke bollocks.
this was hard to watch
I ll pass on it. I thought lady thor was a stupid idea. king valkyre  and hippy thor. no thanks.
I dont like this at all! thor basically said he no longer wants to be a hero or ruler of asgard....when he s suppose to be. and from the looks of it he wants to be more like star Lord...  why be like the jerk who let thanos get away and almost murder tony stark!  and I dont see natalie portman as a good female thor. why is her character even back in the mcu at all  throughout the whole franchise she has contributed very little or nothing at all. the mcu really didn t bother trying to make the character thor interesting and instead made this norse God into one huge joke. thor can be na ve when not knowing much about earth  but he s not stupid. its like taking kratos and making him act like a fool. I feel bad for true fans of this character.
Im just so glad that we got endgame before everything got too woke. the mcu is an abomination now.
oh man  you too  I was just playing that earlier.  great co-op game. I hate fraggers though.
@dying rose              frags are based
technically its mighty thor not lady thor. I didn t think the comics were all that bad  hopefully the movie turns out good. yeah they tend to sprinkle in woke shit here and there but I can overlook it if its actually good  if you dont watch something these days for having something woke in it you wont have anything to watch at all
you mean how they ve followed the comics accurately  why are people too dumb to get that what they are doing with the mcu is exactly what marvel did in the comics decades ago. marvel isn t too woke now  its always been like this...
hey melonie have youread bill gates new book screw all you people I have my own underground city
I wont support anything related to disney  no matter if it looks good or not. tired of their agenda.
yeah  Im pretty sure its going to suck
not only does thor  love and thunder not look funny  it doesnt look exciting either. too bad. also  thats interesting crazy that lara croft became an idol for you. Im glad you got away from crystals and came back to God!
youre the only one who has reacted that didn t laugh at all. its all subjective but maybe you dont have a sense of humor.
pretty much a teaser trailer. yet kinda underwhelming for some reason. like come on that ending of teaser trailer with jane foster  yeaaaa idk if I am excited or still feeling like what I felt after endgame. watched only spider-man no way home. the only marvel movie lately lol. I dont know if I will watch this or not. facts on that melonie mac. looks bad
so now natalie portman  thor s old love interest is now might thor... I really like her and the other main actors  but Im out. no interest at all left for the m-she-u.
screw this movie.  I wanna see the male wonderwoman.      and I bet her delts are cgI   like the abs in  300 .
ah yes the reveal of another mary sue from marvel
yup the thor trailer doesnt look good.  feels like they are just trying to check boxes with jane foster - must have powerful wah-men take over for the incompetent toxic male hero!
what ! !  how does this look cringe ! it looks good for a teaser trailer. you know youre going to see this movie stop bluffing.
king  valkyrie  what a joke. thor had the worst trilogy and now is getting replaced like an old wolf out of the pack. Im truly concerned for what my daredevil will become in this new marvel...
comment cus me cant think of nothing
pass
ragnarok was the only good thor movie.
an mcu movie     yawn
Im so over the mcu and its cringe comedy. thor love and thunder looks lame and nobody cares about a female thor. this movie will definitely be woke af
it really was so dumb how the israelites were trying to worship everything but God  this is the reason why people who say oh well people would turn to God if God showed him  like no they wouldn t  the israelites are a prime example
this is coming out in july. and they just started marketing. thats  not good imo. but  its not like movies haven t been late to the marketing party before.alas  I am not impressed. I do not care for this film. best thor film was the first one through and through. fight me.
she thor sucked in the comics.  it was really bad stories and the character was given victories  instead of winning.
and lara croft
showed himself
it looks like woke garbage.  making thor look like  man bad  jane good.
why does hollywoke consider it ok to expropriate  exploit  and dump all over the beautiful old norse mythology of the aseatic Gods
hard pass from me.  Ive no interest in watching yet another beloved male character get destroyed and replaced by a strong wahmen.
thor s a dude s name  so having someone else have the hammer makes no diff to their name. its like calling every president  obama . to my mind  they wanted to get rid of thor and replace it with someone that isn t a straight white male  and ezra miller was too busy banging a chair on some lady s head  so this was the next best thing.and Im out. there s parts of that trailer that are pretty but none of it looks exciting. it makes me sad. there s a vacuum of entertainment now  and the world is grim  and needs cheering up  but hollywoke cant do that any more.
dumb title for a movie. will reserve my judgement untill I watched it.
thor 1 was good. thor 2 was boring. ragnarok was a terrible comedy made for 12 year olds. no way home is by far my favorite mcu film  didn t care much for infinity endgame or any other mcu film in the past few years though. loved wandavision  scarlet is the best mcu character right now  which is why mom will be the only good mcu film for at least a year lol.
that looks like a stuntie not portman. I see no reason to watch yet another film where thor is a second class citizen in his own fucking film.
it looks like every other mcu movie released since age of ultron  nothing special
the marvel ruined my favorite character...thanks m-she-u. I ll be skipping this movie...and the rest.
seriously  thor needs to   find himself   again!  all so we can have female thor. btw...  isn t thor his actual name  looks like garbage.
when will people get tired of watching the same old crap over and over again. will there never be anything original again
looks dull.
marvel s representation of thor is pitiful and disrespectful to the actual God of thunder  the only two individuals that inherit thor s hammer is his twin sons  magnI and modi. they inherit his hammer after he falls to the world serpent and they manage to rescue his hammer during the destruction of asgaard. marvel is a shit organization with shit writers and talentless hacks.
zero interest in watching this
this is trash. wont even give it a chance. the morons thatscream  give it a chance  fail to understand that when you do that then they got your money. I ll pirate it and then give them money by watching it in theaters later. or better yet wait for my youtubers with the same mindset as me to review it.
I absolutely love meat I hate vegans or I should say I hate militant vegans all I can say is just back that cow up to my dining room table and I ll carve me up some steak tartare with a little bit of capers and some red onions my mouth is watering already enter follow a blue t-bone steak.
fuck this movie seen it called thor 3 lol
nah  I wont watch it. I refuse to give these people anymore money. I enjoy thor starLord interactions. but nah  miss me with this garbage.
explains why they took so long to release any trailer. looks like garbage.
k
they have to nerf him  he s too powerful. he literally beat thanos full power in iw.
it looks kinda crappy
are the snowflakes trying to replace thor with a whaman     lol  get woke  go broke.
Im commenting just to support  but I have no interest in this movie. I think the series ended with endgame  and thats where itshould stay. and making a female thor  I dont know man  seems like forced diversity.
agree with comments but moronic fans will still pay 800-1billion to see it .wtf . the batman was an even worse movie  kravitz cant act neither can  ed cullen .
this looks sooooo bad  what a pansy looking  thor   once considered a God. the line that you must  humanize  thor is against the chatacter itself. you came to see epic battles with mythological creatures  instead you get a weak  God  with mid-age-crisis issues. yuck.mel I keep coming back to your videos for the wink face in the thumbnail.
.
sorry I have to disagree with you this looks awesome and she thor is cannon and wont be taking over from main thor.
yeah  this trailer is a big nothing-burger. I grew up on marvel comics. so Im a comic nerd  but this movie looks boring.
no more fat thor    whatta utterly disgrace0 10 worst movie ever
@13 29  ..prince of egypt .. not 100  accurate..  neither is the book of exodus.  I dont mean that in a condescending way. do yourself a favor   dive into hermeneutics. you ll be grateful you did and you ll see the humor in your remark.in a perfect world  hermeneutics would be mandatory teaching in high schools world wide. some call it  the art of good-faith interpretation   I call it  the discipline of not misunderstanding. side note fun fact  moses   exodus is actually a re-imagining of sargon of akkad.  no  not  that  sargon of akkad . sargon of akkad was the king of the akkadian empire of mesopotamia  the first multi-national empire in history. he lived from 2334 to 2279 bce. thats 2300  years before Christ! this is just one of many examples of why we should never take anything in the Bible to be literal  especially in terms of literal historical accounts. the Bible  especially  the old testament   is the longest running game of telephone in the history of human kind  and thanks to hermeneutics  we can look back   find every point in the game of telephone where someone twisted   changed the story bit by bit over the last 2000 to 5000 years.
