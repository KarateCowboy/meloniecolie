aaaaand video demonetized  surprise surprise lol. if you want to support my channel please check out the subscribestar link in description
anytime I see these people signaling as hard as they do I immediately know they re awful people. great to hear you speak about it.
here s the thing....we can cancel people without being obnoxious online. obviously both ezra and amber are abusers....so I vote with my dollar. im not seeing fantastic beasts  or the flash  aquaman 2 etc. im no longer buying disney products since they support grooming and disrespecting parents. im an 80 s kid....so Ive been watching shows movies from the past  when stuff was actually good . there s literally 100 years of great film and tv and we had a couple of good decades of games. also  I go outside a lot more now...so let hollywood burn like sodom and gomora. more indy studios are coming online  indy comics are awesome  and indy games are great as well... we are going to come out of this better as a society  im hoping .
its one giant virtue signaling. look at what disney did to jd when they dropped him from  pirates of the caribbean   but kept his animatronic on the rides and his likeness on merchandise  toys and action figures.
sjws and feminists will always get a pass. I think ezra hates women because he cant be one  .
gina did it right  got wrongly shamed by disney but pushed through and now seems to be living her dream. she had someone in her corner.as long as you are on  the message   drinker s voice   you can get away with anything. they are lost. time for a little sulfur and fire.
how can people not see how obvious it is that certain people are allowed to get away with anything
this person is such a great superhero  definitely want children looking up to them  .. lol. ezra is just an awful human. such hypocritical standards from the wokies its sickening. keep up the great content and keep up the awesomeness.
I lost my faith a decade ago but I find alot of comfort hearing you talk about Bible passages  thank you for being you mel
haha I love that when melonie said she would only date a  man of God  she seemed to have broken a few hearts I heard what melonie said  she wasn t preaching  she gave a personal answer to a very personal question.having been a Christian for most of my life I understand. I think to an extent it makes a lot of sense  especially for raising children. it just simplifies things and your spouse isn t someone to have barriers between. being open minded and tolerant of others  beliefs is great  but having fundamental philosophical differences with someone that your supposed to share your life with not so great.also  seriously why would she choose a sub optimal partner  for real.
appreciate the little Bible study in the second part of the video. regarding finding a  soulmate  or  the one   I think matt walsh said it best   my wife became  the one  when Imarried her.  in my own experience  my wife and I certainly felt like soulmates once we got to know each other  but it took time and a lot of serious discussions about our beliefs  standards  and convictions to arrive at that conclusion. we also both said several times that we had matured enough to know what we really wanted in a spouse. now  nearly 8 years and 4 kids later  love is more about conscious effort than euphoria and romantic giddiness. but thats what makes for a truly enduring relationship.
hI there  new fan here  really enjoyed the video of you and the critical drinker talking about gaming and the message  so much so that I subscribed  also itsucks that you were demonitized. have a good day though!
I dont even get the pronoun thing but this guy needs to be in jail for 5 years at least but wb seems to not care and still will let him be in the flash movie the hypocrisy is blood boiling
they definitely only care about the money and their own reputations out in hollywood. love your videos and wanted to share my favorite verse   kind words are like a honeycomb  sweetness to the soul and healing for the bones.  proverbs 16 24
melonie  I cantestify that when you marry a nonbeliever and how it can mess your life up. I destroyed my own witness because of my decision to marry a woman who was not only a nonbeliever but anti-God which she blamed on her aunt and uncle from when she was a child. she went to church with me until we got married. she had an affair with her ex-husband and also decided to swing.
hey melonie  just wanted to say thanks for all the great content! this channel has been dope.
I love thatspeech that you had at the end it definitely encourages me to keep going in faith in Christ even when we go through trials and tribulations and dealing with the negative opinions of others
also  what if our  soulmate  isn t someone that we re meant to be with in a relationship  but someone that brings balance to our life  like a dog. or a best friend. maybe the determination can be a little loose  I dunno.
thank you for this melonie  I really needed to hear this today  especially the part about those who try to live a righteous life seem to face more obstacles. I dont use a bank for a savings account  I buy stocks and crypto instead  and last week my account got hacked and I had several thousand dollars in crypto stolen. Ive been having a hard time with negative thoughts about giving what I get  rather than continuing to give what I wish to get. I really appreciate you and your outlook. thank you  again
sucks that your video got demonetised. . . but keep going strong  melonie - clearly youre doing something right. yeah there will be haters - and thats not surprising  given the world hates the one guy they need right now. keep giving your all to what you do - the Lord our God is always good      plus  the right one will come at the right time - in the meantime  enjoy your time and make the most of being single - youre doing great!
of course it was melonie they hate what you do
that was fast  sounds like youre doing something right. triggered the woke algorithm with the truth.based on what the quartering has said in his coverage  its probably because you said johnny depp   amber heard.
I would not be shocked if they demonetized due to reading Bible verses in the future.
its because you mentioned johnny depp. youtube does not want his name mentioned in videos. they have no legal right to demonetize your video for that  but that wont stop them. this is why places like rumble and bitchute are important. let thequartering know about this and he will put the fear in them. he is good at solving demonetization disputes as well as copyright disputes for that matter.
in the time it took me to finish it wow  I dont get  nothing in there that isn t being discussed all over yt
they despise the fact that you are more likable   intelligent than they are.
wait... they demonitized this video. why  subscribestar here I come!
why am I not surprised  we cant talk about jd and ah! youtube knows youre correct though.
here is a suggestion as an idea I knew the entire time  why you called your fans   boomers   but here is another one as an idea  boomies ....boom homies.  boomies.just a thought.I personally am not bothered.
if you constantly have to scream that youre a good person  them youre probably a crap person
demonitized    yay !    thats good right     oh...its not    aww shit
might be because you didn t use ezras preferred pronouns.  you have to participate in their nonsense or you will be punished.
your video was demonitized likely because you were getting very close to prejudicing an ongoing court case... you know someone who claims to be a  journalist  or a  commentator  should probably look at the legal guidelines when it comes to covering court cases..
oh you mentioned heard and depp and certain names. there is actually an algorithm in youtube that looks for their names and demonetized the vids.  I think tug gets around it by using their initials and things.  its dumb but thats youtube for you.
you knew speaking the uncensored truth gets you demonetized.
you should read the bondage of the will by martin luther. the free will arguments didn t originate in the Bible  but were due to people like thomas aquinas using the philosophy of aristotle and mixing it with the Bible. I just subbed a few days ago and love your videos!
great post! I also do the  vote with my wallet  thing. I also do not microtransactions and haber been working my through some snes and psx rpgs I had been meaning to play. Imiss when the things are so much more simple...but  I am thankful for the ability to meet great people around the world!
but thats not disney lol  thats warnee  still not giving mobey to hollywood in general is what you should do and surely I try as well
meh. I dont really care.
without being obnoxious       what s the point
as you are so against grooming  I assume you vote with your wallet and dont donate to any charities associated with the catholic church then...
@scott mcmahonÂ  correct...I also dont believe in illegal immigration  which is another reason I do not give to catholic charities...
buffalo bill intensifies
wow Im sorry to hear that man hope you are doing well now  at least God revealed to you thatshe was a snake before you wasted your life with her
what a nightmare situation... but itsounds like she committed adultery against you  so biblically you were in the clear to get a divorce so you lucked out there.
Imean you aren t wrong a soul mate isn t always a romantic connection
great video today.  Im a pastor of a small church and I love your takes on culture and great Bible sharing at the end.
Jesus wanted us to love  be kind and be humble. love watching your channel and your Christian faith is beautiful. no religion is perfect but perfection is just ideology. love your verses and discussions on it  keep being you melonie! God bless you!!
damn melonie mac going on the offensive  finally talking about amber heard  and ezra  I thought you where asleep on this one. thank God I lived until now  God really wanted me to see your take on this. Im so lucky to have found your channel.
anybody else just love that moment when chrissie mayr nearly jumped out of her skin learning melonie s age  that was so funny
just saw you in a critical drinker vid.  happy to discover another intelligent badass who tells the truth. you keep doing your thing.  they turn on each other...  we outnumber them.  keep being fearless.
hollywood and the government. its incredible how similar they are when it comes to dirty deeds. love your show and your hair looks great!
they fit the narrative  thats all.  hypocrisy at its finest!  heard pooping in the bed actually amazed me more than her abuse towards johnny.
this might help with where  soulmate  came from. the greek philosopher plato  in his text  symposium   wrote about the reasons behind the human yearning for a soulmate. plato quotes the poet aristophanes as saying that all humans were once united with their other half  but zeus split them apart out of fear and jealousy. aristophanes explains the transcendent experience of two soulmates reuniting.
Im loving the hair. you know since ezra has their right views on life he want really suffer anything  and hands down you are one of my top 5 channels I look forward to daily God bless keep up the awesome work
melonie mac doing her best impression of lara croft! approved
I think being a Christian is meant to be difficult. I certainly find it difficult. there have been times that Ive wanted to do certain things that I know I shouldn t do  but in the end Imade the right decision and I think its because Ive always strived to please God. that doesnt mean I haven t messed up  but as Ive gotten a bit older its become easier to not give in to temptation. stay on the straight and narrow  always.
I can only assume its because they dont want to out themselves for their own abusive skeletons in the closet.
since ah has been abusive to all her partners  hopefully her next partner is a chick who knows how to fight so she can just beat the shit out of ah in self defense when she pulls thatshit without the media being in a position to play whiteknight
on the topic of soulmates  the depressing thought is that yourealistically could have your soulmate be someone well older than you or when you get older be well younger  they may never be able to meet you given a geographic location  or are possibly already gone. realistically your partner is just someone who hopefully you have stuff in common with who is nearby  never the best fit  but just the best in your area. thoughts like this are why I dont even bother  well  this and watching nearly every relationship crash and burn around me.
loving the lara croft inspired look - rock it  melonie!
hey good late afternoon melonie I just want to say that I really love and like your Bible verses that youread everyday bc it really helps me stay strong with my faith with God and helps me that I need to continuing to read my Bible everyday to know that God loves me very much and so I just want to thanks for your Bible verses everyday melonie. anyway getting back to amber heard and ezra miller abuse issues that I definitely think that ezra miller needs to take time off from movie acting duty and other acting position and find himself a special hospital for people who needs help or instatution  place who needs extra supervision and get some help before he kills someone and end up in jail for lifetime  ok melonie. anyway also amber heard needs take her child and move far away to other state or country and stay away from johnny depp for good bc no woman like amber heard needs to be with a guy like johnny depp and get beat up and be in so much pain for getting abuse from a guy like johnny depp  ok melonie. anyway I have learned and been tought on how to treat a woman nicely and respectfully and kindly to a guy  ok melonie. anyway I just want to say and talk bout this abuse issue between two famous hollywood actors and actress  ok melonie. anyway I hope you have a wonderful   great blessed day today at gym and hope you have a wonderful and great blessed day and evening at home with your pets  ok melonie. anyway have a great day and night melonie.
as always  thanks for sharing the verse of the day  and I appreciate how you expound on it. God bless you and keep up the great work!
hypocrisy is a norm among the entertainment industry and progressives.
whenever you talk about the verse of the day I always feel a peace in my spirit. God is obviously using you!
I feel sorry for amber  must be frustrating trying to talk and deal with someone who s in a constant coma from being a drunken drug addict.
I saw that. it is a trip that melanie could easily pass for 25 years old.whatever that girl s got  she needs to bottle it and sell it. she ll make a billion dollars!!!
thats old news  its been a known fact for over a year already.
@henshinfanaticÂ  and its still funny.  to this day!
she wouldn t abuse someone who could get away with defending his or herself.  ah knows how the game is played.

13 19 - a way I would phrase it is that you need to be near enough to unbelievers to potentially evangelize them directly  but keep enough distance from them to be able to leave their lives  at least physically  if they become too spiritually toxic for you to involve yourself with.
I think the same can be said about the woke mob  same as a bratty child going bananas for not getting what they want  these people fall apart in much the same way when they dont get what they want  same problem with bratty children is these people weren t told no enough  or at all xd
love the tat of lara on your shoulder. thank you for keeping it real. may God continue to bless you.
you spoke the truth. thank you for sharing.
Ive been here since the quartering shouted you out. I cant even remember how long Ive been watching drinker. I saw you on there and just thought aww! it looked like it was fun.
personally  I feel thatsoulmates dont exist as far as a person you were born to be with destined for. but when two people get married they become one flesh and form a soul bond through the marriage. so in thatsense  I guess you could say that your soulmate is whoever you end up marrying.
found you because of the critical drinker  subscribed  haven t regretted it. keep up your great content!
thank you for your words of wisdom. God knew I had to here them today
it blows my mind that the worst people are somehow the most blessed
Im impressed with your desire to follow Bible standards even if others dislike it. props to you for that.
thank you for choosing morals over money!  may God bless you ms. melonie!
unevenly yoked  means one person doesnt pull their weight.  it doesnt matter their faith  it matters their contribution to the home and the relationship.  when one person has to do all the labor  physical and emotional  that is unevenly yoked.
its not wrong when we do it
Im generally worried about the new tomb raider game sure its gona look pretty with unreal 5 but I believe square ethics department will make the changes to tone her down or censor content
I canceled disney s culture by not supporting them with my wallet.
re-read gina s tweet  definitely not the same. best wishes to you from copacabana  rio de janeiro  brasil o
jd has no right to be treated like this
just more proof that if it doesnt fit their narrative they dont care about it.
hImelonie mac! I always enjoy your videos! God bless you  3
gina got fired because she didn t read the apology statement.
so well said  thank you
they all go on about  its not cancel culture  its consequences for your actions!   yet have never been told  no  or punished for their bad behaviour. they ve never faced real consequences.
hey me too!! really loving her channel!!
not in the way the Bible talks about it
2 corinthians 6 14 do not be yoked together with unbelievers. for what do righteousness and wickedness have in common  or what fellowship can light have with darkness
well  then  I guess Im wrong.  one person doing all the labor is okay  as long as long as neither is an unbeliever.  good to have that clarification.
actually  I think you have a point here especially when in reference to deuteronomy 22   10  you shall not plow with an ox and a donkey together.  there are certainly dangers in a Christian engaging in a close relationship with a non-believer in that the Christian may start engaging in practices antithetical to Christianity  i.e. the ox will slow down to the donkey s pace   but I think its a bit impractical to see it as an outright ban. of course  its ultimately melonie s choice of what she wants. keep in mind thatsome would think she s not a good Christian because of her tattoos  the way she dresses  etc.  all of which are overly stringent interpretations of what is written which  in turn  was interpreted from the language in which it was originally written.
@moobearÂ  it is  just as it was mine many years ago.  free will permits for some odd happenings  my wife and I are both of a non-denominational sort and while I am more of faith  she is not so much.  yet we both pull our weight in our marriage.  it helps that we are together based on mutual respect and loyalty to one another  which was proven two years ago when I became disabled and she had to take over for the income.  I rely on her for much now  just as she once relied on me.  I dont consider us so much an ox and donkey as much as I would compare us to a donkey and horse.my ex before her  however  was an ox and donkey pairing  and why things fell apart.  I did all the work in that relationship and she  my ex  did very little and then just up and left me despite how much I was investing daily for that relationship.  my current wife came onto thatscene at the end of that relationship and waited patiently for me to heal from it enough to try again with someone new.  she was content to be my friend during that time and stayed with me through my tribulations.  I kept her waiting for years before I realized she was what I was looking for in a partner  someone who was willing to invest as much as me in a relationship  and made it official with her.  I was understandably nervous  having been burnt before  but she showed me that it was the right decision.  we met nearly 20 years ago  got together nearly 14 years ago  and live a happy shared life despite our spiritual and now physical differences.  she is everything my ex-wife wasn t and Ive learned what the true meaning of that phrase is about.if the person is a right match  their faith is not an issue as long as pride does not overcome respect and loyalty.  the Lord gave us the option to do as we will  it us up to us to keep faith in him  not for others to determine the weight and nature of that faith.  our relationship with God is that of individuals  he will judge each of us as individuals  no matter how many we are in a group.  I believe that faith is more than just words  it is how one lives their life and if they remain true to God.  if he wants you to be with a non-believer  is not to be questioned.  there s always a reason.  sometimes it is to demonstrate rather than speak  to bring out the good in others  a candle that drives away the darkness surrounding another and bring them into the light through kindness and loyalty.  the Lord knows what he s doing  even if we dont understand at the time.  though my ex wounded me in ways that will never fully heal  I needed to learn those lessons so that I would prosper when the time came.  my wife now is the blessing I prayed for when I was young  and the Lord made sure I was in the right place at the right time with the right lessons learned.
@bearded frogÂ  yes  because thats what melonie was saying
God bless you abundantly melonie!!
hey melanie  like you I want to believe in soul mates however what about someone who s spouse dies and then gets remarried  does that mean the first second spouse is not a soul mate. thinking practically I think God s brings people into your life for certain seasons... anyway that us what I believe... your videos are awesome and love watching them... later and God bless
I cant imagine that david zaslav is going to let this slide forever  he s already threatening to clean house in cnn and he knows that this makes wb look reeeaaally bad.
have you shared your testimony   I dont recall you being so open in the past. was it a life event  or something you just kind of kept to yourself the whole time  I have noticed that a lot of youtubers I follow seem to have their  come to Jesus  moment when they get in their 30s.
the wisdom is strong with this one.
your hair looks cool like a trophy for exploring 80  of the map
I wonder if miller is just not taking his meds for a condition you know like marv in sin city.....
I know people that think they are doing good but are hurting others.
well said melonie. and disney nor his family have had control of the company since the 1950 s. so disney shouldn t be the name of the company post 1950 s but the company only kept the name due to licensing.
you need to buy critical drinker a drink lol
thank you for taking a stand for your faith.
if one loves another  they will change themselves to better a line with each other. so that they become  one union. however beware of liars who feign the faith. that will poison one s faith.who d you like to play lara croft next  gina carano  gal gadot  or someone else thank you for verses and videos.
me thinks amber heard and ezra miller would be the perfect couple
I like you sticking to your guns about the equally yoked issue. you cant give into pushback when youre just following the Bible
so ezra is becoming kevin.
I dont understand why people get mad at the  unequally yoked  verse. nothing makes more sense than wanting to be with someone who shares your beliefs.
Ive had some good conversations with a few aeithists over the years  and everyone  of them after talking with them for a while said   paraphrasing   youre one of very few Christians Ive spoken with that didn t look down or condescending towards me. I said no one has the right to cast you aside. I cant throw any stones because I have myself to fix  all I can do is guide. people that put others down who have done nothing wrongful or immoral are pretenders.
a.h.   ezra miller are not gonna get away with this
they just need good character references.harvey weinstein is willing to testify to the good character of both ezra and amber - so they cant be bad  right
justice for johnny this is why I skipped seeing fantastic beast 3 I love harry potter but ezra miller and amber heard are terrible people I saw father stu instead a good movie with mark whalberg
he is becoming kevin from problem about kevin
thats a cool story and I believe you bro.however  in my experience atheists are some of the angriest people Ive ever met.Imean its almost as if they re angry at God yet they claim not to believe in God....
@michael quaidÂ  as an atheist  my experience is quite the opposite. the most hateful and angriest people I have met in my 40  years on this planet have been people of faith  Christians and muslims specifically while some of the kindest and most gentle people I have ever known have been atheists. itseems to me  from my observations  that faith unfortunately has the ability to make some who possess it feel righteous and superior to those outside of their system of belief. because of my negative interactions with Christians specifically  do I think every Christian is as hateful as the worst I have come across  of course not as I have known and been close to a number of Christians who are very good people. just something to consider  but if every atheist you have met are amongst the angriest people you have ever met then perhaps the reason they are angry is how you and or other members of faith interact with them.
good coverage on this. not many other journalists are really addressing the content and hypocrisy of the ezra miller thing yet. I agree that its important to give an analysis on the integrity of the media machine. good side is the implications of the legal changes being enforced against companies like disney for unwanted political choices. giving solid positive reviews on projects might be a more common thing in the future.on the Bible verses  not as an argument but as a thought  Jesus sought out and spoke to the woman at the well. it might be my interpretation or opinion but I believe it was because he was considering the content of the soul  over the reputation of people. I agree that its important to be around people who agree with your belief system. when you go beyond that  you are likely to find yourself in a position where your originally intended peaceful conversation becomes an unintended battle. when people are seeking peace in their hearts then its difficult to find it like that. keep being awesome.
melonie mac go boom I love your hair and outfit today. loving johnny depp is a multI partisan thing really. acyually Imean non political. edit  o my God you are lara croft.
found melonie via the critical drinker  awesome!
I just dont get it and yeah this is the second time in a week and a half that ezra has been in the news for this crap.  I follow the jd stuff through yellowflash and that umbrella guy here on youtube.  it was a toxic relationship but clearly she was the abuser in the situation in my opinion.  I didn t realize that jd found out through a magazine article that he was let go from the pirates franchise.  much like how gina found out through media about her dismissal  I left following star wars after that myself.  Im just not saying this for lip service but it was interesting for me to hear that Im not the only one that thinks that there is a bonding of essences during relations.  through Christ we rise.  through melonie we go boom.
dont fall melonie you only go boom
hello melonie I absolutely  your outfit tonight.I hope your family aredoing well  thank you for another enjoying video.takecare melonie your the best
lock ezra and amber in a room....... two human enter one human leave
amber heard is no better than what she blames her dogs for.   mepoo
keep fighting the good fight!
praying always helps
hImelonie. your friendly neighborhood atheist here again to back you up. I cant speak to what s written in the Bible  although I have read it  I agree with you for different reasons. marriage outside of one s faith is never a good idea. faith is for the faithful the cornerstone upon which all else is built. a husband and wife may disagree on many secondary things and still have a happy life and a happy marriage  but faith isn t is a secondary thing to the faithful. marriage is a loving dance of disagreements and compromises  but a conflict of faith is a fundamental disagreement that cant solved  a compromise that always remains out of reach. unless one partner agrees to surrender unconditionally on the matter few marriages can survive it.
I heard people call it missionary dating.... its when a Christian and a nonbeliever are dating... its a struggle Im sure...
jada and amber need to hang out
being unequally yoked makes a marriage more difficult. as someone who has been married to the same woman for 23 years  I can attest that marriage is work  even with God s grace being poured out on our marriage every day. doing this without that grace  oy!on your comment about virginity  there is a difference between virginity and chastity. we are all called to chastity  even within marriage. its respecting our sexuality as God intended. for those who aren t married  it means something different than for married couples.
driving into kissimmee I thought  melonie mac would probably dig this place darn near perfect
but on another note  thanx for keeping the awesome wavy hair look.
the subject you bring up at 23 00 reminds me of a parable. a man is walking along the road w  an angel  he comes to a glorious city  walls tall and strong  with an imp of a  demon lazing outside the city gates. the man thought the city righteous and good for its splendor and that there was only a little imp there. the angel corrected him  explaining thatsince everyone in the city was so wicked only an imp was needed to push them to sin. further along the path they come across a weathered old man beset on all sides by seven demons  large and frightening. with their wailing and gnashing of teeth the bystander exclaims that the man must be wicked surrounded as he is by these powerful demons. the angel again corrects him  explaining that this old man was one of the most righteous and so the enemy sends their strongest to try and get him to falter. thanks for your videos and good luck with any future endeavors.
can we get a reaction video to who I thought would have been a great lara croft and may have inspired a generation of glamazons  https   www.youtube.com watch v idtycklizni
Im glad my hatred for the flash was finally justified
Im a virgin and Im totally filthy
yep  paul teaches for Christians to not be unequally yoked. a budding tree cannot grow and produce in the middle of a fire... great vid as always
Imay not agree with everything you say but I definitely respect your opinion.
the best movie amber heard has been in was  the ward.  interesting that a crazy person s best movie takes place in a mental hospital.
a preacher in my church has said verbatim  in a lesson geared toward recent converts   flirt to convert is dubious.  this should make sense from both a worldly and a biblical perspective.worldly perspective is simply that trying to change your partner does not work  and if you try to change your partner after committing to them  neither of you will be happy in that relationship.from the biblical side. proverbs 4 23 says guard your heart. 2 cor. 6 14 do not be yoked with unbelievers. matthew 5 28 lust is adultery in the heart. trying to convert people to Christianity is meant to be a selfless and righteous way of living out matthew 28 19  go and make disciples of all nations.  and sharing faith should not be done with a lustful heart.its one of the more difficult callings that God asks of us  the most common reason people leave the church  in fact. but sex and marriage are meant to be valued very highly  assuming you follow the Bible s teachings  and neither should be given away lightly lest the partner come between you and God.
and in the other hand  chris pratt is in the edge of cancellation every week  why  oh yeah  just for being who he is and not being a hollywood sheep
God does warn us not to envy the wicked. I was taught as a kid that cheaters never win  then I grew up and ventured out into the world only to find out that cheaters do win... for now. in the final end they will lose and thats why you shouldn t envy them.
living our lives in accordance to a book that may not even be the actual word of God does not peak my fancy  but I respect those who do  and I generally agree with most of your commentary on religion at the end  though I believe God wouldn t be so strict as to force us to not marry those who dont believe.
hey melanie! dont fall down   go boom!
thats exactly what it means! you should not be friends with non believers. its plain as day. if you claim to be a Christian  you have to talk the talk and walk the walk or just be silent if your walking is crooked. read deuteronomy 22 5 to your trans friends and say goodbye to them. dont just talk about it  be about it.
thank you for saying  him  and not going along with that ridiculous pronoun bs

I am orthodox Christian by default the most conservative of the Christians  and in our church if you marry someone outside Christianity it is ok if the partner decides to get baptized before the marriage.  beware this is only for non Christians if someone is Christian already with for example catholic then of course no need for baptism I agree and think its best to marry within Christianity  I know of people that got married with different faiths  then they had children and the problems started.......
so true
Christians not dating non-Christians is to protect both the Christian and the non-Christian. I have never seen a marriage between a Christian and non-Christian work out.ever.
gonna be that guy but thats a very nice blue shirt.  wanna get that for my girlfriend.
melonie  if u record your voice and raise the pitch  you make the most perfect chipmunk.
I agreed with everything said until you went on to religious stuff  I hope it gives you what you need in life but its of zero interest to me. I find it absurd to let an old book dictate how you marry  but simultaneously Imight have difficulties falling in love with someone that loves the disney spinoff sequels
yeah the thing here is...everysingle time someone in the old testament choose to marry any woman outside their own people  the entire nation ended adoring false Gods and other abominationsI think thats why they told us  do not marry anyone outside your faith
as a Christian - it is far easier to be married to a Christian.
they should have just kept the actor from the series version.
nope her best movie was a movie thatshowed her true colours all the boys love mandy lane. if you ve seen it you know
its so stupid
14 10 melonie seems to be unaware of the contradiction in what she is saying.  no one is pure. the Bible is extremely clear that we are all sinners  and  we are made pure by the blood of Jesus Christ . either the first or the second is true. basically if believers  are made pure by the blood of Jesus Christ  then they are pure. to deny that believers in Christ are pure  is to deny the efficacy of Jesus death for sins.  what God has made clean  do not call common.   acts 10 15 macs view is a typical evangelical misunderstanding developed from 1  biblical illiteracy and 2  supercharged emphasis on sin. basically imo in this view  sin rules over the cross and the spirit.here are some Bible verses affirming the purity of believers 10Â so that you may approve what is excellent  and so be pure and blameless for the day of Christ  php 1 10 5Â the aim of our charge is love that issues from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith.  1 tim 1 5  2 tim 2.22  1 pet 1.22 22Â do not be hasty in the laying on of hands  nor take part in the sins of others  keep yourself pure.  1 tim 5 22 15Â to the pure  all things are pure  but to the defiled and unbelieving  nothing is pure  but both their minds and their consciences are defiled.  tit 1 15  2.5 2Â when they see your respectful and pure conduct.  1 pet 3 2 3Â and everyone who thus hopes in him purifies himself as he is pure.  1 jn 3 3 8Â  it was granted her to clothe herself with fine linen  bright and pure   for the fine linen is the righteous deeds of the saints.  rev 19 8 14Â and the armies of heaven  arrayed in fine linen  white and pure  were following him on white horses.  rev 19 14 fyi. https   thescripturesays.org 2018 11 27 simply-are-Christians-sinners-or-saints
Im not saying hook up culture or indiscriminate sex is a good thing.however  men can have sex with zero emotion of attachment involved. thats just how most men are built.and it will never affect them long-term mentally or anything like that.but for females it is much different. they always have sex with some kind of emotion involved in a heavy way.even if it is a one night stand  earlier that night that man made them really feel something.I just think most people  no matter what side youre on have trouble recognizing the factual differences between men and women.
if anything I hope aquaman 2 bombs at the office and fails since they wanna keep amber heard attached to it  but then they would probably blame something else for it failing
facts
amen
jd is guilty till proven innocent!

commenting to feed the algorithm

nah  they just point the finger at conservatives and say   well they re doing it more.
@doc louisÂ  youre not wrong   d
cancelaquaman and the flash
damn  thats a cute top.
I agree as a Christian it is unwise to date someone who is not a Christian.  people tend to forget what marriage is  that is becoming one. a representation of the unity shared between God and Jesus. marriage is a union of man and woman  again becoming one.
in silver linings playbook  its considered some good thing that bradley cooper trashes things. its because he s so tormented  dontcha know. men can smash things. women are expected to steal a muscle car and go on a wild ride with her hair blowing in the breeze yada yada yada.
where s the discord link
Jesus did say if a man looks at a woman with lustful thoughts he has committed adultery in his own heart. same applies to women
she s a hypocrite  Im not taking either side because they both insulate that you are bad because you dont believe what I believe. they just use a different way to relay thatsame message.
satan s greats trick is to prove that he doesnt exist.
Christian women are the best
Im still pissed off nobody s getting onto paul thomas anderson for making a film normalizing pedophilia  people are actually calling that vile film a  masterpiece
what about poor chris prat! receiving death threats because he s a Christian!oh... and my favorite books of the Bible are job and ecclesiastes.
seeing you in that blue top leads me to one conclusion....go to the tomb raider set and demand a audition as lara for the upcoming game.re ezra miller  what a leftwing nut all he is.
itshows the closed mindedness  because the Bible says so
they be democrats- hypocrite is their middle name. or liars.
why is wb continuing to defend   simp for a.h.   ezra miller
stop saying my  name Christian  people
is ezra miller really a man though  really  lmao
tbh  flash sucks and no ones going to watch it anyway.
I dont want to follow Christianity its to much like a check box of rules for me and in some ways to small minded but I do follow the teachings of Jesus and of God I also like hinduism allot but I dont want to choose a box so I just call itspirituality.
in my link tree  d discord.gg meloniemac
yup  Imade a video about this subject
yes  he is. he has xy chromosomes. just because he s an effeminate man doesnt mean he isn t a man. now... is he masculine  in the proper sense of the word   not even close.
@roosclanÂ  does it mean he acts like a man   d
@jakemonster001Â  define  act like a man.  acting all macho  being brutish  acting like a gentleman  acting with integrity  fortitude  temperance  self-control  patience  wisdom  strength  honor  be careful how you define it  lest you fall into the  toxic masculinity  trap.
@roosclanÂ  calm down nance hahahaha
too
nah. no soulmates. completely fine without one. I see all of the men getting canceled  and Im like   nah. sure. there s good women. but why risk it.
