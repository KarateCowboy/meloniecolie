great video melonie. no one holds themselves accountable anymore  it is always someone else.
hey melonie. its sad when people do this kinda thang. I hate it when people get scammed. Im not big into gambling myself. I remember grewing up playing poker with my family  except mom  she did like it  but we didn t use real money. just the poker chips. I agree with you on people having mental issues when it comes to addictions. good loan policy  becauses thats so true. people need to be more cautious. stay heckin cool melonie.
I watched sliker s stream this morning and he tried to apologize and he also admitted that he needed help... I hope he gets the help he needs to stop his gambling addiction...
if twitch is to ban gambling  does this extend to all gambling within games  stock markets  crypto  anything at all there isn t a guaranteed exchange of goods for service  if you want to put gambling behind an age verification  sure go for it. banning it  I dont see a reason.
melonie I feel the same exact way about gambling! what a waste of money.
hImelonie I hope your doing well today thanks for always bringing these very interesting topics to discuss.takecare melonie
wow melonie is on a tear with the uploads lately.  love it!
as much as you were talking about this on twitter  not surprised by the video  lol. Ive had friends with gambling problems before  it can get bad. I dont even buy loot boxes  myself  because I dont want to throw money away your hair just keeps getting prettier as it grows  btw melonie
I work at a card shop and when it comes to people buying booster packs whether it be a pack  a box  or in extreme scenarios a case  it boils down to a gambling addiction disguised as a playable game. Ive seen a guy spend in excess of  1000 to pull three copies of a .79  card. he didn t want to buy it through the secondary market  he wanted the thrill of opening up those packs and get it that way.
does twitch have a gambling license  no  there s the answer.
very wise words about not loaning money you cant afford to lose. if its someone close to you then youre better off treating it as a gift so it wont get between your friendship. if its not  then dont give them money at all.
I dont mind keeping gambling. if hot tub bodypainting  thirst traps  taking advantage of lonely and or attention intimacy-deprived people  is okay with twitch  gambling  which might be viewed as taking advantage of addicted people  or naive people  when considering the slikscam  should be fine too. now if you ll excuse me  I ll just sit here and sip my cup of tea  while enjoying the show this current world puts in front of my eyes
I like your food addiction and banning food comparison  and also your policy on lending money
if I loan money to someone  I only loan what I am comfortable not getting back. circumstances dictate what happens but if I can afford to help a friend  I try.
if twitch dont mind gateway porn  itshouldn t mind gambling
the entire platform is built on the idea of exploiting addiction  buying bits etc. . so I kind of doubt it will happen.
twitch should ban scammers in my opinion and my rule for gambling is  only bet what you are willing to lose  then you will be fine how that isn t a basic rule smh
my wallet hurts hearing a guy lost 100k
this has nothing to do with the video. when will anyone in the  fandom menace  wake up and add melonie as a regular panelist or has the offer already been made  open bar  fnt  simpcast. she s been on all of them and viewership and live viewers coincidentally goes up per episode. why mel is still flying solo is beyond me. a gig as a regular panelist can only help her channel.
youre 100  right  if you want to loose  a friend  - borrow him something
her hair looks good. I think she s been doing a more natural look which is rare these days.
thats straight up a mental  emotional issue imo  chasing the dopamine hit at the expense of that much money
I used to collect cards - and for me that was gathering  not gambling. I think that majority of people  Im only guessing though  are doing this because they like to gather  find rare things or  to catch them all . for some it could be ocd-related  you want every part of the whole  I dont know how to put it  its like this feeling when one element is missing from the jigsaw puzzle
@melonie mac go boom  yea I can definitely see the emotional side of of that too now that you mention it
its a good take and I agree  but then lootboxes across gaming in general probably dont have gambling licenses
this comment didn t age well
@snaplemouton  it really didn t
the equivalent of food addiction wouldn t be to ban food  but to ban people who publicly expose themselves eating 50 burgers and 20 packs of fries on stream. society needs principles as well as retainment and thats because there s a lot of people who cant control themselves. the very existence of gambling relies and preys on individuals with little to no self-control  so let s not pretend that its an innocent practice born out of nowhere. gambling streams are just as bad as someone smoking weed on stream.
sly-ker not sure if you were doing that on purpose but his name sounds like when you say an old light bulb flickers.flick-erslick-er
I hate people thatscam others  thats it.
I get that not banning gambling on twitch wont curtail the problem of future gambling addictions  but its like saying because we cant ban pron outright we should just have it available in schools for children because they can get it on their phones anyway. we can make small  incremental changes towards righteousness without solving the problem outright in one single swoop.
6 30 most twitch viewers have wantd hot tub streamers banned for a long time now lol
lul I like sliker but sometimes he really is dumb and not just an act.   and if I thought there was anything redeemable about twitch I would  be all for them breaking ties with gambling.
Imean  gambling is pretty bad  especially gambling in video games which targets children. itsimply destroys lives. my father s friends were high stakes gamblers and they were constantly winning and losing properties  heirlooms  etc. it tore their families apart. another guy I know from a men s gathering was in torment because he couldn t shake the addiction. gambling is just a sham. the house wins. if it didn t  it wouldn t be a business. the only winners are those who get out.
twitch should ban gambling because its not cool to sell children to gambling sites  which is what these streamers are doing.
gambling is about 95  of the time meant for entertainment  not a means of income. the 5  probably only applies to card counters  cheaters  ridiculously lucky jackpot winners  or games like hold em where you bet against each other rather than the casino website. even then  your experience and skills only mean so much against the pure rng of the dealt cards and community cards.
we re about to make a lot of   melonie. there s a lot of lonely people out there. your the showman  Im the snowman.
the reason people are blaming gambling has nothing to do with sliker s situation  people just want to use it as a catalyst to see change on the platform. the largest streamers are being paid  from 6 to 8 figures  yes that much  to gamble on advertiser s crypto gambling sites  the only reason they get paid in such lucrative deals is because a large portion of their viewer base is easily manipulated into trying to get the  big one   and these sites get a sizable return on investment. when such a large portion of the twitch user base is underage it becomes a real issue in seeding addiction in children that will be exploited even worse when they have real income. the real question is why should these sites get the right to sponsor streamers when their sponsors only cause addiction and loss  and also drive away other sponsors from the platform. sometimes having rules is important to protect people who wont protect themselves.
well  it is a site focused on gaming and a young audience  these gambling sites let minors play and lose money on the sites  but they can not withdraw the money. I dont think skanks or gambling belongs on twitch or youtube. thatshould be kept on 18  sites
I dont know how online gambling is a thing...... the known sites have all switched to  free  money a while ago
gambling has the highest s_icide rate of all addictions.twitch is watched mainly by teens and young people  I guess  and its surprising to hear that gambling is not yet banned there.
great video and advice go boom
idk  streamers being parasocial with other streamers and trusting them for no reason seems like their fault  banning is censorship
Im not a gambler. Im a impulsive spender who buys things I dont need. especially fast food  video games  and movies and tv shows on bluray.
back in the days when people would go against mafia members who gambled and lost to the mafia members they would send in the loan sharks that had to be a scary thing back then
you can bet these people wanting to ban gambling wouldn t get behind banning marijuana or alcohol. they only want to ban things they dont do.
so what is your take on loot boxes is it gambling or not
oops
all a big virtue signal in my eyes.
@w1llki11edsnake07  thats fine that you feel that way  doesnt really change what other people want though.
no one is blaming gambling  but it is iresponsible as a site to allow this to be marketed to children. they dont allow porn  and I would argue that is not even as bad as gambling.
or just let everything go
the minority of people protect bathtub streamers its the workers that want to be as accepting as possible. also  poker is not   to gambling  imo.
all the above and alcohol for me lol
. how ya doing
they have done gambling. they are just pulling the ladder up after them.
itseems people have lost the lesson so eloquently given by polonius in act 1 of hamlet   neither a borrower nor a lender be  for loan oft loses both itself and friend  and borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.   the bard with yet another timeless truism.
the lack of self control and personal responsibility in this story is really distressing  and thatseems to be a common thread with these twitch people. gambling online  video game skins  touch some grass people  and I dont mean in a video game.
scammers are also cowards
what he did was horrible and he should be punished. either gambling should be banned from twitch  because of kids  or twitch should make it be 18  content. Im leaning more towards it being 18  content but I d be fine with either. also  its funny that the well-known big streamers like pokimaine are asking for a gambling ban but are defending the hot tubs  pools and beaches streams. hot tubs  pools and beaches streams should be banned because of all the softcore korn that is all over it and because kids get to see it  how in the frozen over hell is this suitable for children ! .
but if we ban hot tub streamers how we gonna figure out the best hot tub to buy maybe we can come to a compromise  ban gambling in hot tubs
I love gambling.  Im not nearly dumb enough to do it myself  but I live in vegas  so the more idiots we have throwing their money away  the more options I have to do fun things.
I think gambling is terrible  but similarly to something like cigarettes  its your choice to cause harm to your finances mental physical health. I dont like the idea of banning things like this because then those in authority go hungry for power  banning whatever they see fit.edit  I freaking wish parents would control what their kids do on the internet. just give your kids a ds at this point. take away the internet. my gosh
it was not the gambling that made him scam people  it was the loan sharks that made him scam people.
the argument that makes the most sense to me is that csgo gambling sites tend to more often than not just be big scams  and that would be reason enough to ban them. if you just have a general rule of  no gambling   then you get into the murky gray area of whether or not gacha games or lootboxes count as gambling  which on certain countries they are considered that.
this dude scammed a bunch of his users because of his gambling debts he better hope he doesnt know the family s money
its people s own discretion. at least they age restrict channels heavy on gambling.
I agree if you gamble its a risk but cant blame gambling. people asking for money is never a comfortable thing unless its for a good cause. gambling is a business some win most lose but if you let it take over you  then it becomes an addiction. in short to each their own..
twitch didn t banned him! what f..... thats the big question
mass punishment for the actions of one individual is never a good idea. have the offender be accountable instead.people forget that the prohibition party banned more than alcohol. arcade games like pinball and skeeball   billards  as well as gambling games were banned as well as a  time waster . pinball didn t get unbanned until 1970s. the ban of games helped the mob get big thus the birth of fbi.so no  banning games no matter what context is never good
gambling can be rough on some people. so can alcohol  medication  carby food  smoking  online pron  hookups...etc. how about some self-control
twitch should ban gambling because it is unsuitable content for a large swath of their target demographic  which is people under the age of 18.  it is not legal for those people to gamble  so you should not market gambling to them.
I personally wish they would take hot tubs off of twitch.gambling is whatever. however  if it is an online casino  made this tweet in response to your tweet  that is illegal to visit in countries  yeah thatshould definitely be banned single it is illegal and these people are using van s to visit these sus casinos.
gambling makes to much money and is probably going nowhere. I think its killing sports and it could end up harming gaming as well.
should look into the issues around it more. seems like a large lack of research on your part considering you cant even pronounce the scammer s name right. there was also a very big movement to ban the hot tub streamers before twitch decided to put them into their own category for whatever reason. the problem most sane people had with gambling was that it was sponsored. the sponsor was the problem because if youre a streamer with a high teenage viewer base and you keep getting the sponsorships  that pay a shitload of money  in the millions.  so if you keep getting those sponsorships  the chances are 100  that you are getting teens into gambling  because no way in hell are they gonna keep sponsoring you at a loss. and thats basically what ended up getting banned  all the sketchy crypto based websites thatspecifically moved out of the usa to have more lax laws around casinos were banned from twitch  not gambling in general.
dont wanna get scammed .....dont give randos online money . ez
bot
this is a bad look for twitch  I am sure their pr teams and legal teams will advise them to put a ban on gambling so something like this doesnt happen again in the future to any of their users. as a giant  worldwide platform  they should have the obligation to ensure the safety of their users. its just good business and good morality.
its like banning let s plays because dps keeps begging for money and he uses that money for his gambling addiction. banning the  gambling  category doesnt do anything.
42 days til  halloween
train throws more than that away gambling.
only after there was a big back lash did he own up to what he did. he never apologized to the the people he scammed. instead he confessed. all the mean time fake crying with not a single tear coming out of him. also he let itslip in the stream that he s sorry because now he cant scam again.  he should be banned for scamming his viewers.  please note that rehab is free in the uk  where he lives so dont believe him when he tries to raise money to go to rehab in the future.
its like if someone scammed a bunch of people and went to a casino and lost all of the money then later admitted to ripping people off and blowing the money at the casino. it wouldn t be the casino s fault or gambling  it would be the fault of the person who scammed everyone. instead of banning gambling  they should just ban him. I am not much of a gambler I dont feel like it is a good idea to waste money on a game of luck. also on a side note  I feel like twitch should put s stop to the hot tub streaming  its just dumb and doesnt belong there in my opinion. twitch was initially intended to be a platform for streaming games and related content  at least thats what I thought. I feel like if you wanna stream yourself in a hot tub  half-naked and stuff like that there is platforms that exist for that.
his name should tell you he is con artist. you ever hear of a city sliker. yes you are right. you should never loan anybody money unless you can afford to loose it.
hey melonie I just want to say that gambling is sooo highly addicted thing to do and I dont do it and so I think that twitch should ban gambling and not be having it on twitch at all ever  ok melonie. also scamming someone is a crime and it is wrong and I think that the person who is scamming someone else should go to jail for rest of their lives for what they did wrong  ok melonie. anyway that is what I wanted to say bout this video and the topic of this gambling issue  ok melonie. anyway hope you had a great day today and hope you continuing to have a wonderful and great blessed evening at home and have a good night too melonie.
for some reason I had to re-subscribe to your channel.not sure why. perhaps its just  youtube being asshoe   as saltycracker would say lol.also  Ive got to say  overly smokin  hot in this video...but thats nothing new heh heh.
I dont care that he s sorry. I would want my money back. and if he wouldn t take him to court
sliker scams people to gamble the money away on slots or some csgo site.  now people want twitch to ban gambling.. which makes no sense  punish others because this guy did something..
yo trainwreck... can I get a cool  100k also
I d say ban him for scamming  duh
hImelonie what s your favorite ps4 exclusive
gambiing shouid be banned oniine  and so shouid be games with iootboxes and microtransactions
there s data that bans on advertising reduce incidence of children getting involved. philosophical arguments aside  banning adverts works.
we need to get rid of asmr. I thought pokeimane was alot more open minded then this  she seems like she back tracked a bit  with this. your more open minded then her  and if she is trying to help change the world then she needs come out of this woke movement state  of mind. thats why I dont watch her as much. maybe you guys got her on thatshow that everyone was on last night you might be able to help change her mind and open her eyes.
what about pokimane and those e-girls that lie theyre  single  then make minors and lonely dudes give them money  this isn t a form of gambling  we should ban that as well.
I dont give a f! about gambling  what I give a damn its justice! sliker should be in jail for fraud. he can fake as long as he wants.... I will never believe him
it was at leasat  384 000
I disagree  dsp uses gaming streams as a shell to beg for money to feed his gacha addiction  however the whole stream isn t him showcasing his addiction and glorifying it. he isn t actively promoting wwe champions and is just throwing his money away like an idiot to get the best characters in the game. on the other hand many of these streamers who do gambling streams are sponsored by the sites and will be paid large sums of money each month or week to gamble with on their site  confirmed by multiple gambilng steamers  and I believe they have heightened chances of bigger and more frequent jackpots and big wins  though this is just my opinion. their whole stream is glorifying gambling and is no doubt getting at least some of their viewers to gamble also as they think they could win big too. this may not be illegal but is indefintely immoral and so think gambling should be banned from the site if twitch cares about their viewerbase.
43 until all saint s day.
its not exactly free. the uk people pay taxes for it to exist for people to go to it.
@w1llki11edsnake07 Im well aware of how the uk pays for its health systems. its the same here in canada. our tax here is insane. my point is he wont be paying a single cent directly to the rehab facility should he decide to go. a lot of his viewers dont know this and will be suckered again.
@mugsykins  this stuff just blew up even further. the gambling side of this group of people outed someone as a sexual assaulter. maybe melonie should do a follow up
I respect your opinion but dont ban gambling because some people have no self control. let idiots throw their money away and everyone else can enjoy a little gambling   if they want to   if people like the guy in this video aren t blowing money on gambling  they are going to blow it on something else  then you have to ban that also
then they might actually have to go outside and get gfs
spam bots in your comments melonie
marone
yes. Im for banning all forms of gambling. all forms. Im ok with that. bye bye magic the gathering cards  bye bye pok mon cards  bye bye las vegas  las vegas should be banned and canceled from the world. everyone relocated to other cities and las vegas is professionally turned to rubble 100  and let the desert take it back.edit  being stupid is no excuse to allow it to continue. just look at what s happened to the country because we allowed the  woke  to live.
its the nanny state. because some people cant control themselves  why should the rest of us suffer
Imean  if you want to ban guns  im not fone with that  causd guns are not good or bad and have some good aspects at least. hotthub und gambling not lol. all the aspects are absolutely negative. thats why banning it  at least on twitch  is okay. because it isnt about art or gaming either.
the stupidification of people is spreading.
this is like asking macdonalds to ban sodas. why should a private company do what you want
ban it because it causes addictions laughs in 1920s and 30s gangsters
I am for banning it. it isnt even allowed to have lootboxes in videogames  why should you have gambling on a platform like twitch. its widespreading a highly addictive behavior and platforms.  its like pushing drugstreams.
woman I cant be on ur side with ur take on the gambling cause the fact they are gambling and influencing young people to gamble cause they are winning money but they didnt know they were making millions
well  people have different viewpoints. Im personally a very conservative person  I dont believe in the right to be degenerate. I dont believe people should have the right to do whatever they want. you obviously canthink what you want  just showing the other side.
@bigman dogs  you can have this view point sure  but the problem come when someone wants to outlaw an activity that you do  then you have no ground to stand on.
@sparkiet88  we both know that I canthink of something that is currently outlawed that you want to keep outlawed. something you find morally reprehensible and unthinkable to even question allowing. I could give examples but Im sure I have already made the point clear and I would frankly rather not have to. you would respond  well obviously thatshould be illegal . thats sort of the point of politics. we all draw different lines in the sand  and whoever wins get to decide what goes.
@bigman dogs  no I just think legislating morality can be a slippery slope and can also back slide and end up outlawing stuff that you would think are morally right but someone else thinks is wrong.  the only way to assure you are avoiding that happening would be freedom  freedom to do degenerate things  freedom to make mistakes  freedom to screw up your own life. logically this is the only way you can have a sound argument to not outlaw something on your side thatsomeone else will object to. you dont need examples it is just a simple logical thought pattern  my stance is so long as it is not hurting someone else then you can do it.
@sparkiet88  well  by your own words you have no grounds to stand on since we both know there is at least one thing you find so reprehensible that you think itshould be illegal. you even admit it yourself. you claim this means neither you or me have no argument for preserving our liberties since we want something banned. the only difference is that you think the things you want banned are obvious  but they aren t. you have either made a conscious decision or taken it for granted. and even within the confines of your standard   as long as it doesnt hurt others  ... it would mean I cant run a casino. 17  of gambling addicts will try to  delete  themselves. this is an extreme overrepresentation even among other addicts. why should I not be allowed to run a casino and make people addicted for profit  consciously harming countless people in the process  casinos even have the right to ban people who make a profit  the goal is to lure in suckers and drain them dry. this shows how subjective the whole  not harming others  is. you support gambling because it doesnt harm others  yet I was able to present a case for gambling institutions being banned on the basis of them harming others. we disagree. Im not a liberal  Im a conservative. I have moral convictions that I want to impose on others for my own good and for their own good. others freedom to be degenerate will eventually affect me and those close to me negatively. humans are not atomized individuals  we are a collective. others cantry to resist my views by pushing their agenda on me  that is how politics works.
@bigman dogs  I stand by my stance  so long as you are not hurting anybody else  you should be able to do whatever you want. its not that hard of a concept to understand. it doesnt matter what I think is a moral action  as long as it doesnt hurt someone else. do whatever you want to yourself. how is that arguing against myself  how is that not having ground to stand on  how is thatstance not logically sound I just wanted to point out how not logically sound your stance was. Im also not sure why you came back to this after 24 hours.
@sparkiet88  sorry I was editing my comment whilst you were responding. I frankly didn t expect you to read itso soon. feel free to re-read it if you wish. your response has already been answered by my full message. no real point in me responding until then since I dont know what you have and haven t read.
@sparkiet88  also about the 24 hour late response. Im not terminally online so I dont check youtube every minute of the day. I got your response notification when I checked youtube. the fact that youresponded so quickly is frankly odder is it not  Im confused.
@bigman dogs  sorry I have you tube one my phone with notifications  so I knew right away   sorry if that makes you feel uncomfortable   I just assumed the discussion was over where I said my piece and you said yours  now you are bringing it back up and retreading the same ground. I thought you were not going to bring up examples  not you are  I thought this was a philosophical discussion   not a specific policy point.obviously nothing is going to be perfect when it come to policy. but you have to start from somewhere  I am starting from and idealize logical positions  you use that as your base then build up from there.you are starting at you personal feelings and trying to impose your personal morals on other people  that doesnt work when your side loses power  because they will impose their morals on you now  and you wont like it. so policy should strive to be as close to an idealized type as possible  to be this would be liberalism of the classic sense. personal freedom   personal responsibility  personal consequence and please stop assuming what I think talk to me not the straw man in your head
@sparkiet88  I have made no assumptions. Im trying to draw conclusions based on what you say. you could argue Im taking you too literally. I was just arguing that  everything that doesnt hurt anyone else  doesnt work in practice as a standard. we as people have different understanding of what hurts other people. you for example believe that me hosting a casino wouldn t hurt people  I believe that it would. this applies to countless other situations where we cant find common ground on what harms people and therefore ought be banned  gambling is just one very obvious example. Im not a liberal so why would I ever strive for such a society  it is quite ironic that you accused me of trying to impose my subjective morals on other people as though it makes me wrong. it is exactly what Im trying to do  so what  I think of what is important to me and then think of how I can contribute toward society moving in that direction. you say my mentality doesnt work because other ideological convictions can gain influence and impose its will on me as though that is undesirable. that is the point of politics  politics is power. someone wins and someone loses. there is no such thing as a completely fair and equal compromise  some people will always be extremely unhappy with the way society is run. the irony is that you believe that you aren t trying to do the exact same thing. you argue that classical liberalism is as close to ideal as possible in terms of giving the outcomes you believe are good. that is your opinion based on your preferences. I firmly disagree and will push for political change which marginalizes liberal thought. in the same way  classical liberalism marginalizes my preferences. to me liberalism is the nightmare scenario you described where another ideology imposes their will onto me. I dont want to be an atomized liberal. there is no objectively correct political system  it all depends on what outcomes you seek. I dont seek to maximize people s liberty  so why would I ever gravitate toward liberalism  it would be very counter productive.
@bigman dogs  well you keep assuming my opions on gambling and casinos yet I have never mentioned them at all.  you keep assuming you know what I think is morally right yet I never mentioned that at all  I have only mentioned ideas and theroies.  you are either not listening to me or completely missing the point  and as such this will be my last attempt. if all you want to do is impose your moral viewpoint on the county   you cannot complain at all when the otherside gets into power and imposes their morals on you. ones that you would not agree with or even find fully unmoral. my ideal form is that we create a system that cannot seesaw back and forth between different sides  just depending on who is in power  changing laws to fit their wills. we should establish law and order based on higher principles that dont change over time or bend in the political winds. there are natural intrinsic human rights thatshould be our starting point  any laws on top of that are limiting human rightsthere is definitely an objectively correct system  because we can say that there are definetly objectively bad systems. so hence if nothing else we can say that the good system doesnt include the bad elements .  I can say that a system thatstrives for freedom liberty and justice is objective better than one that does not.
