ms. heard today is the day that you will always remember as the day you almost caught captain jack sparrow.
this isnt just a win for mr. depp this is a win for all male abuse victims
question  is amber heard a vile creature. answer  yes
I was raised by a wonderful set of parents  who taught me to love and respect women.  and I absolutely do. and while I do tend to believe the overwhelming majority of women who make claims of abuse  this goes to show why due process of law still has to matter.  women can lie just like men can lie.
I pledged the  8 million to johnny.  - amber heard  probably.
absolutely stoked on this correct result. what a horrific person amber heard is. Im not a johnny depp fan at all  though I did like the work he did in dead man   but he was totally abused and defamed by heard. great result today!
so glade he finally got justice been six years of all the hate  loss rules  stress he probably went through glad he can finally rest a bit
the trial verdict is great. johnny got some finical recompense  but let s not forget the amount amber damaged johnny for far  far out weighed what the court ruled. I dont know that any defamation case can fully provide retribution. people like amber do damage way beyond what even they stand to gain. such is the nature of evil.
today s a good day for johnny and those who are standing by him.  johnnydeppwins
when it comes to supposedly  scientific  studies  there s an old saying that goes  figures dont lie but liars can figure!  also   I was stalled at my weight loss and took your advice to eat beef.  since then I  have leaned up and noticeably visibly see that Ive lost fat. as a result I have now lost 50  pounds and only have 10 more to go.  240 to 187 as of today  thanks for your great content on the channel!
johnny won  8.35 million overall. it was 10.35m - the 2m for amber. statutory limits.
it was definitely served. and as I said elsewhere amber can go cry on juicy smooyay s shoulder for all I care. justice prevailed today. a word of advice  johnny  start your own studio and production firm  if you haven t already. make your own movies and television series. the hollywood machine is a dying carcass. good luck  buddy. and keep your attorney on retainer. because they re coming for you after this win  man.guaranteed. that train will not be late.
not a fan of defamation myself  but Im glad that there was some justice served. I hope that depp and heard  with some proper counselling  will come to forgive each other.how wonderful to know that the Lord our God is far more merciful to us than we deserve.great video as always  mel!
youre the worst ex husband Ive ever heard of!  ah! but you have heard of me!
maybe its just me  but I actually felt bad for amber while the verdict was being read. it was the only time I remember her looking like a normal human being.  and knowing just how many people hate her now has to be brutal. dont get me wrong  Im glad johnny won  but they are were both a hot mess. between the booze  drugs and everything else. its no wonder it ended badly. I just hope they both sit down and do some hard thinking about their lifestyle choices  and get the help they need. maybe amber can even redeem herself one day
praying out loud seems more serious  we re not just babbling our internal monologs. you praying out loud on camera for one of your commentors a while back felt that way...it also was one of the more fearless things you ve done on this channel
I grew up in a Christian family  but I dont personally follow the faith. I believe in what has evidence behind it  and I actually agree with most of your views. I would love a video dedicated to what you have learned over the years because I believe understanding each other helps a lot
if amber believes defamation is covered by freedom of speech  then why did she counter-sue for defamation
yeah the money issue is questionable but Im glad that he has justice.  finally!  yay!   justiceforjohnnydepp
the only thing I hate about the verdict is that they awarded ah 2million to her because of adam waldman s tweets... basically they concluded that those words were attributable to jd. guilt by association is stoopeed.edit  he basically can only collect 8 million total because the 5 million punitive is gonna get knocked down to the statutory minimum which is 250k I think  and minus the 2million compensatory to ah.
haha beat me to it!
are we absolutely sure itseems it might take some time for more people to be talking about it outside of bring it up as celebrity gossip.
@doc louis  doesnt matter. people can shit talk all they want but they cant deny facts that happend in this court.
I double your  pledge
I pledge to like your comment
@mr dee  I pledge to thank you!
yeah  jd lost a lot more than 15 mil  which is what the jury established  and he s actually getting  only 8.35 mil from that.for him was more about clearing his name than anything.
I agree praying out loud can make prayers more powerful I think when you say words out loud it almost makes them more concrete like you actually are genuine if you do it in good faith
I am so thankful that the court battle between johnny depp and amber heard is over and done for good. anyway I just got tired of hearing bout it and I just wanted to be over and done with for good. anyway I hope that they can move forward with their lives and do whatever they want to do for themselves. anyway I just want to tell you that and make a comment about this video from yesterday  ok melonie. anyway hope you have a wonderful and great blessed evening at home with your pets and have a good night too melonie.
now he can sue the tabloids for all the bullshit he went through and how he was labeled a spouse abuser.
more proof men can be victims of women too. in the end  its not always about gender  but the person who does it and the person its done to. as a male myself  this makes me happy because what if Im a victim down the line  will people believe me if I reported it and tried to get help and as for prayer I totally agree with you. God encourages us to make our requests known to him. some people think we can just think our prayers and that will be heard and some go too far with ritualistic stuff. God just simply wants us to have a relationship with him  and what s the most important thing in a relationship  communication which is ofc  talking.
10m   5m  capped at 325k due to virginia law  - 2m    8 325 000.punitive is capped in virginia.
Im happy that they favored johnny s side. this was a tough trial all around. amber really damaged johnny...
I would love to see a Bible study video about what you were talking about at the end. also you seemed a bit quiet in this video  almost had to put it at full volume to hear you. its nothing major but just wanted to bring it your attention. great vid mel.
bravo to johnny depp! glad he won! amber turd go bye bye lol love it to melonie mac go boom! true on johnny depp from you melonie mac go boom! support your channel and you always going go boom on everything and you are awesome
your verse is the same one I read last night so now I know its confirmation. I love that you talk about God at the end of your video s. keep being a prayer warrior of God. youre helping other s through him. iron sharpens iron.
feels like forever I took nutrition for my culinary degree  and the one thing that really sticks with me is that there are essential nutrients that can only be gotten from eating meat
thats real justice  not the fake social kind.
I hope dp keeps showing up in movies.
there was a  350k cap on the  5 million awarded. so  he won a total of  8 350 000.00  after her  2 million is deducted.
I would like to see what ever videos you have in mind it would be interesting because I feel like not a lot of people know the difference between being a pharisee with legalism and being lukewarm and not living for the truth its all a matter of the heart are you being genuine or just appearing to do or say the right thing just for show
freaking turd is ofc is going to appeal  but this trial showed to everyone how awful this woman really is  and that is the win.
this is awesome... and congratulations to thatumbrellaguy
should have heard tug and flash cheering! I got so many alerts at once  im checking out the reactions of my favorite channels
great channel from a secular humanist!!!
Im in favor of the judge. I feel bad for the jury for having to sit through this. way to go johnny. ok thats it for this vid.
for him its not really about the money. he just wants to work again.
thank you king
they have a lot to go after her on perjury.. so she should be careful about  pushing  too much.
@noszodd666  she won 2m on what   0 I thought j won all the disputes
@cynical thoughts  jd won his suit  but she had a counter claim. she lost that overall but won 1 charge for 2m.
@noszodd666  gotcha
this now increases the odds of willy wonka 2 being a thing
you could say jd finally  gave ah the finger.
Im glad to see the jury make a correct and powerful statement with their verdict. trust  much like respect  is earned  not given on demand based on your gender. as for the Bible video idea  I d happily watch. might even be convinced to chime in on chat or something.
I agree with you. I pray a lot throughout the day and there are plenty of times I pray out loud. and it does at times feel more impactful. I always like to say that Jesus is my greatest friend. because  he has always been with me no matter what. and he always will. love your videos  always encouraging. keep it up. and melonie  like always  Im still praying for you. have a good day.
johnny depp s bank account go boom...
greatest moment of my life!!!!!!!
amber heard s net worth is currently - 6 000 000. it used to be - 8 000 000  until johnny paid his part of the agreed payment. amber s legal costs were covered by her homeowners insurance.
hey would love to watch a video of your thoughts on willful sinning also love your accent I get a chuckle out of certain words that you say when youre being blunt. stay encouraged in the Lord.
a quick thought on preying out loud  satan and company are no more telepathic than we are  so if you always pray silently they dont know that you aren t just in deep thought  as opposed to when you always pray vocally  they can plainly see that you are in constant communication and safe for them to hang around.
justice fucking served.
he will actually net  8 350 000.00 as the punitive damages are limited to  350 000.00 in virginia.
Im not going to let them take away my sleep and brain cells arguing with  amberturd stans  so I just focus on celebrating the vindication of a real victim.  justiceservedforjohnnydepp
ok now let the state convict her for many accounts of perjury. she needs some jail time.
love the scripture comment. I think we absolutely need to do our very best to follow Christ as directed in john 14 15   if ye love me  keep my commandments.  Imean can we say we truly accept him as our saviour if we cant accept his commandments
remember today as the day they almost caught captain jack sparrow.
explanation of the amounts in virginia punitive damages are capped at 350 000 by law statute.so jd was awarded 10 mill. compensatory   5 mill. punitive. after regulation by law thats 10 350 000.ah was award 2 mill. compensatory   0 punitive. after regulation by law thats 2 000 000.so if in virginia  or maybe california  since both live in ca.  you can net the payments then jd should receive 8 350 000 usd.
what a fckn w fam
so does this make jack sparrow exists now
believe all women  was always going to result in false claims. investigate all claims and punish provably false ones.on the video idea you mentioned  Christianity is a simple concept but not so simple in practice. we re saved by faith alone  but thatshould have a noticeable impact on our demeanor and actions. we re not supposed to judge others  but we are supposed to rebuke other Christians when we see them sin  though in private and as a brother . Ive only recently started reading the Bible again and am by no means an expert. Im always open to hearing insight from those that have it.
a man worth over  100m had to spend millions to show a woman is a liar  what canthe regular guy do
oops  make that not safe to be around. thanks for the read.
amber heard stans  lol you gotta be kidding me.
@john blaze  found one!
ngl kool   the gang celebration. played in my head.
I pray out loud  for the most part  for 2 reasons  one  prayer is a conversation with God  and its just more natural to converse with someone in words. two  my brain tends to like to chase shiny objects  so praying out loud keeps me focused on what I want to say or ask so that I dont   ... heap up empty phrases as the gentiles do .
its 8.35 cuz.. the 5m was reduced based on law.. so its 10.35 -  2m.. so 8.35 in the end...
I have never seen so many women suddenly wake up and care about mens rights and female abuse in relationships.
megapints for all !
God is omnipotent to the point that you can be silent and still be heard.and he delights in hearing us pray  whether out loud or in the quietness of your heart
well said on the Bible study.  Im glad johnny won  now he needs to find Jesus.
how you doing today mama  lookin good as usual!  boom
Im glad he won  however Im kinda sad to see people blindly supporting him. he said some really disgusting things like how he wanted to f ck ambers burnt corpse  no normal sane man says something like that no matter the situation. he is a victim in this case  but he s also not someone people should be supporting or looking up to.
the best thing to come out of this trial is amber turd
Im glad that things came down on johnny s side. if they had ruled in her favor that judgement wouldn t have been about facts and evidence but politics. Im sure thatshe will appeal the award to a sympathetic judge and it will probably be reduced but thats not the point. the point is that principles are more important than money. itseems like most people are glad it came out this way except the amber heard simp network. you know which one  the one with five letters.
the  5 million dollar punitive award is capped to  350 000 by state law.  so depp receives 10 350 000 to herd s 2 000 000.  depp gets a net gain of 8 350 000.
did you notice the necklace she chose to wear   looks like a noose! she knew she was gonna lose and needed one last mindgame to play the  victim
Im just glad its over.  another channel I follow said amber and smollett should get together because they have a lot in common.
I bet she s sorry she violated the nda of the divorce.
kjv romans 10 17 says s0 then faith comes by hearing  and hearing by the word of God. so I believe when we pray aloud it helps us to activate are faith. it goes from a thought to an action.
to anyone who believes that you cant survive on a meat only diet. take a look at the inuit tribes. there s no vegetables where they live.their diet mostly consist of meat and fish. not only do they have better health and constitution than  modern westerners . they have better dental health too.
what happened to the balanced diet
biblical commentary notice God was telling cain to master his sin.  this fact is one of the things that lead me to stop believing in total depravity.  we have to be willing to do what cain refused to do   master our sin.  obedience is to be done out of love and respect for God.
what is a woman
same
I cant drink anymore!!
that was a reference to some old british comedy show. yes  its still quite vulgar and disrespectful in context  but he was not saying itsincerely
@adamthegameboy  I know  but thats not something a man who s innocent and good hearted says in my opinion. thats a sick thing to say no matter the situation. I just have a problem with people who are fans of johnny and stay blind to the creepy things he s done and says  clearly he is also a sick man. I have so many friends who refuse to acknowledge that just because he s their childhood crush
when you are being abused you turn into a person you never wanted to be. if date women you understand
frankly if thats all he said  he showed a lot of restraint lol. I know many people who d have done a lot worse than say some mean things to the person who physically harmed them.
it does kind of look like a noose.
thats where you are wrong  you need vegetables for ruffage   I dont even know how melonie goes to the lu wthout vegetables  maybe its just the grace of God  or she secretly takes them. dont try to copy what melonie does  know your body first understand your  limits otherwise you are asking for trouble.
depp will get 10.350.000  and turd will get 2.000.000   the law in georgia limits the punitive damages to 350.000
love for God  loving the things he loves  and gratitude for the sacrifice of his son  our guy Jesus   joined with faith in his promises to us  inspire us to do good works. we dont  like  earn salvation through works  but we cant help but want to do good works when God enables us to be people who love God and who love those around us.
amber alert
act mean to other people  karma comes back to getcha. nice to see.
there s a song you d like that meshes with what you were saying in your scripture comment. look up  no earthly good  by the heralds.
good!! boom!!!  so  what comes next
sweet karma

why does anyone care
hI I would just like to say your channel name melonie mac go boom is dumb sorry just melonie mac would of been better cheers  3
trial was bs. you cant tell me that out of all those situations he never hit her. just another man child who was never told no getting his way again.
and what has this got to do with the trialin a secular democracy
the Bible verses and minI discussion are half the reason Im here  they re great!
fool me once  shame on you.   fool me twice  shame on me.

@priest vallon  how did her lip get busted  how did she get those bruises around her nose  how did she get that bruise on her arm  one of those situations should have won her this case. what she said was indeed freedom of speech. instead the man child got his way again due to the general public being nothing but stans. at very  least  they should have voted no contest because there were clearly a lot of things going on in that relationship that can be considered abuse  from both sides.
just a distraction. all these spectacles are.
@john blaze      why dont you try actually reviewing all the evidence presented in the trial  and then post a comment.   capiche
@allan  a.k.a. rockiteman   why are you yelling at me stan  I watched the whole trial stan..what are you doing on my comment stan
@john blaze       1  because figuratively speaking  you appear to be at least partially deaf.   2  who is  stan
@allan  a.k.a. rockiteman   stan is a rabid fan that ignores all logic  reason and evidence because he s starstruck. there are various types of abuse that took place on his part  that is a fact. amber did her part as well but thats not the point. johnny shouldn t have been awarded a win for what he was clearly guilty of.he s a great actor but he s an addict with a lot of problems and those text messages show his true nature. this was a joke of a trial as usual  his  fans  won him this case  not the evidence.
@john blaze      okay.  stan is you.
@allan  a.k.a. rockiteman   room temp iq  literally. you are the type of person thatsits on that jury too  never ceases to amaze me.
@john blaze      I amaze you    cool!!
no need to run defense for amber dude  she already lost lol
@duskwalker68  Im not running defense  Im pointing out facts. as for that loss  elon will cover that without breaking a sweat. johnny still wont be playing captain jack because the truth is obvious.
