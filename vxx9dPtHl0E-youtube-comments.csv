hulk s line in this trailer sums current disney up perfectly   you didn t ask for this  but youre going to have to deal with it.
the  death by snu snu  line killed me. cant wait for futurama to come back.
its nice to hear a woman that appreciates men just trying to be men. I feel for my sons who will open that door for you whether you like it or not and always take the street-side of the sidewalk. in my opinion and theirs  proud to say  some things dont go out of style.
its not very good in my opinion. the she hulk I know is a strong  confident lawyer who embraced being she hulk because the outside finally matched the inside  to the point where she d stay in hulk form because it felt natural to her. she didn t hesitate to be a hero because on the inside she already was one. this jennifer walters seems like the modern millenial  I never asked for this and I dont wanna be a hero but haha Im gonna find out just how strong I really am  character. I also think her green form is missing the bodybuilder bombshell vibe. she hulk is one of my favorite characters so maybe Im a little touchy but there ya go.
hImel - long time subscriber here    8 years ! . I have been following this channel since you started and have to say our ideas and opinions are definitely not on the same side but! I appreciate your side and I still watch every video of yours on this channel - I am always open to learn and understand other people s views. as someone who undecided on religion Ivery much enjoy the last segment of your videos as well.I am glad that we get to know to non-apologetic side of you and excited for what the future holds for u. keep up the great work
3 43 no woman has ever swiped right that much in her life  much less in a row. thats the immersion breaking moment
one thing I really enjoy about your channel melonie is you are very fair about things. you didn t just hate on this. good on you. its fine to like things and be optimistic. other times its very likely something is going to be bad and its also good to point out. either way happy to see you back. God bless.
girl power has to be done right  though...  -mel.darling  girl power hasn t been done right  in years! from tomb raider to last of us 2. kinda says it all  really.
actually looks like fun to me. plus you ve got frog man making his debut  and wong s coming back. also  this show is now called  melonie mac go  hot!    d
nice to see fiona getting her own show.
society likes to push not being happy with yourself or looks. when people like amber heard and megan fox make changes all these people think they need to so they can look and feel better when they should just love themselves. be happy with who you are. you are perfect as is.
not gonna lie  at this point I care very little for the mcu or most films tv shows and even less about celebrity gossip.thatsaid  I still watch your videos because I like your approach and attitude  as well as the Bible study segments.it also helps that youre gorgeous
the last shrek movie looks more appealing to me. they really did lose their best cgI people in the lockdowns. and harvey birdman is the real attorney at law.
I think this is gonna be a fun she-hulk show!!!
the demon thing sounds a bit crazy to me  but it would be boring if everyone thought the same way. I like how you speak your mind  a lot of people seem to say things that they think others want to hear and a lot of media comes off as artificial. I also think its good that you find it healthy to question things in a society where we re told not to.
she s swiping right because her gamma radiation makes all of her emotions go through the roof and she s probably slightly interested  making her very very interested in she-hulk form.  a lot of people dont know her character and think she s supposed to be a rage monster like the other hulk but she s actually just incredibly sporadic with emotions on high all the time  and likes to practice law.
I agree with you there. I didn t think it looked like the total dumpster fire  the hate watchers are advertising  but I even thought the cgI  though not fantastic  is fine... her hooking up in the  death by snu snu   cliche  kind is the only way its gonna work for her like that. I didn t find her not so light hearted jab at super heroes being billionaires  narcissists  and adult orphans neither accurate nor considerate to other heroes. itsounded hateful to me  and all I canthink is   why does she hate super heroes  they are literally her bread and butter. the other issue I have from the limited trailer we have been given is disney s track record... it hasn t been good lately. like at all. the only reason this show does not come off as cringe as all the others aside from wandavision  is the lead is actually supposed to be she hulk  and she s is not a bad character  but neither was scarlet witch. the handling of the wandavison started out entertaining and interesting and then monica rambeau s stupid comment at the end and everyone acting like what wanda did was not insane or criminal ruined it. if they had made wanda an antihero   I guess kinda like they did with magneto first class going forward  it might have worked. it at least would have been coherent  Im afraid disney will do the same thing again here  because their writers have all been proving these last years they dont deserve their jobs.
hello melonie its always joy seeing what s on your mind of opinions.idont think I ll watch this movie.the title isn t catching my ideas to see.thank you  for still giving the Bible verses.I enjoy hearing them from youtakecare melonie
from a visual standpoint she hulk doesnt look awful and it does look like they are at least going to touch on the byrne era of her book.  he made her very sexual then the book was known for its cheesecake factor.   so if they were going to go for the fun she hulk it could work  but some of the dialog we are hearing in the trailer gives me vibes of it going in the direction of demeaning all or most of the men in the show.  I am thinking all the men are either going to be her boy toy  incompetent  or evil  much like how black widow was.  hopefully they dont but I wont hold my breath  phase four seems to be more about pushing an agenda  vs telling a compelling story and developing characters.in regards to valkeryie  the new picture certainly looks better than the one of her in a suit and tie  so I agree with you that the picture looks good.  its just sad that the lady cant act to save her life and she has that one expression permanently plastered on her face.  I didn t care so much about the race swap  I just wish they could have casted someone who didn t just have one expression on her face for two hours.  they race swapped hemdall and nobody cared  or at least very few   because idris elba did a good job with the character.
having seen the trailer for this  the ms marvel girl and being pretty sure of what s going to happen in obI wan - Im so very glad I cancelled disney . I dont even want to watch these shows for  free .
yo ho yo ho its the pirates life for me
you could just not watch disney.
@mike williams  as one does.
I know exactly how to deal with this latest load marvel phase bore  by not watching it .
uh  no  china has a line in reply  which goes  matrix style    there are levels of survival we are prepared to accept.
you dont have to deal with it though.. just dont buy tickets and dont watch it.. if the ticket sales go down... disney learns...
I liked the futurama reference too.
I teach my 2 sons the same thing...be a man  open then door for ladies  be polite etc.... my kids would rather be made fun of for being real men than walked on because they re weak
manners maketh man
those are some gentlemen
what are you talking about this looks pretty good.
@the veggster good day  we have different interpretations of the trailer then  but I would love to be wrong. even if Im not and the show just isn t for me I sincerely hope its good and entertaining to you.
@the veggster good day  anvillior is talking about fidelity to what made she hulk a good character. disney has no fidelity any more  they just take a brand and write whatever the hell they want for a story without regard to where the brand came from. its tone deaf. Im sorry if all you need to see a character as good is thatshe is big and green  but many people like to able to appreciate the substance beneath the appearance  and this like the rest of the msheu  lacks substance  cohesiveness  coherence and virtue. there s no virtue in being a rebellious brat.
what about phoenix wright
@the rotten    ok maybe him too but harvey gets seniority he s been at itsince I was a kid.
well said.
ngl  Im gonna watch she-hulk  as she s one of my favorite characters  at least when she is written as she-hulk
they went with her long term look from the older comics rather than that terrible version thats popped up lately that looks like the regular hulk with a  braid  about the only part of this so far that I liked
God I love your messy hair its such a perfect mess  never change melonie
as someone in my thirties can confirm there are more depressing things then still going on dates.
there is so much disney could do with  she-hulk  but they wont. they ve got to get out the message.
I dont watch your videos because you agree with me  because we aren t always on the same side   I watch for your opinions. I deal with toxic negativity a lot  so its good to hear someone else who is in the middle
never had any interest in the she-hulk character  tbh. if the cgI looks that bad in the trailer  Im thinking I ll just pass on the show. Im a bitsurprised you didn t mention self-control restraint with regards to this verse.
I agree it all depends on what they do with this. if its light hearted and fun I think it will work. if they start to take this  and the character too seriously they will fail. and we ll all be mad and you know the rest of the story but if they have some smart writing and good jokes and situations it just might work !regarding valkyrie I just do not like the actress she s just not my cup of tea nor do I think she s a good actress. but I am willing to  give she-hulk a look but I will pass on love and thunder
fwiw   the problem I have with thatstill image of valkyrie is the look on her face.  it just seems sour to me.
in the comics she was a seductive lawyer type so that is something to look at.
getting my late night melonie mac fix. glad to have you back.
your one of the first commentators that really sounds honest.   there is so much hate for marvel tv shows that it feels like its a bandwagon that alot of channels are jumping on. she hulk is supposed to be satire and fourth wall breaking   she is cartoonist and the show looks that way.
quick summary  jennifer walters is the cousin of bruce banner  the hulk . the car crash in the trailer is probably related to her comic book origin history  where a gangster she was working against tried to get her killed. banner hid her  and treated her wounds  but she wouldn t survive without a blood transfusion. weighting the consequences  banner used his own blood to save her life  and she turned into she-hulk.
I love what you ve been doing with your hair . itsuits you
I love she hulk and am nervously excited about this..
isn t  a doorway on mars  literally the start of doom
Ive been addicted to slay the spire for the past 2 weeks.. haven t beaten it once. doing ascension runs until I find the right synergy to tackle the end. its mostly luck and rng based. at least the daily challenges are singular and easily re-playable to learn from. but campaign runs are just a crapshoot. and Im finding more and more no one can beat this dang game. the basics are easy to learn hard to master. its like if you make one mistake its run over. sometimes I cheese the save n quitsystem trying to see if there s a way to really beat a boss with 37 hp a massive deck and no shields and a worse starting hand than me playing high stakes poker in vegas. also poison is the way to go!!
do everything in love  1 corinthians 16 14Ive never found a Bible verse that resounded in my heart more than this.  when I get my tattoo sleeve  this Bible verse will make it on my sleeve. even those that have done unspeakable things to me  I still love them  from a distance mind you  but God called upon me to forgive and love even them. I dont judge and I dont condemn. everything I do is in love  well the best I humanly can mind you. Im no saint  but my heart is one who loves and never hates. even if they may have deserved it. thank you for this verse.
not sure about the writing  it ll probably suck because its disney  obvious motivational issues for her character but the actual design of she-hulk is faithful to john byrnes   agreeably the cgI does to be fixed up but  she did like carrying dates back to her place for banging to the point of injury in the comics.so meh at the most  might be interesting. at least she-hulk isn t a square gorilla.
death by snoo snoo got me Im crying  d
if it was the o.g. one I would go  but not going to pay for this abomination.
thats the only good thing Ive seen thus far
like realizing youre in your thirties
haha exactly
@randall j. bell
I am in my late fifties. I do not even think about dating and twenty five feels like last week. it comes at youreal fast and hits very hard so maximize the enjoyment that you can find.
@michael maxwell
you need to watch the critical drinker s video
unlike the hulk  which is a case of dr. jekyll and mr. hyde  she-hulk resembles more the nutty professor  where the shy and introvert jennifer walters turns into the pretty  confident and flirty she-hulk. unlike the hulk  jen controls her transformation and retains her most of her personality. but she doesnt like herself much  and spend her time hidden behind he she-hulk persona.
but dont get used to the pretty and fitshe-hulk. chances are  this is the bait and switch for phase 4 she-hulk  which is more... feminist approved.
you will benefit greatly from loving those who have harmed you and the distance does not diminish that.
love the verse and love the hair !!!
melonie says  she looks good   I says   wait until you see her cgI face
they ve ruined my she-hulk!!!!!!
hey melonie  what do you think of elizabeth olsen  scarlet witch  saying thatshe s actually witnessed real witchcraft
can we talk about how this trailer s music is the same from the music in the final sonic the hedgehog 2 trailer
Im a strong wyman. also  do youreally think my butt looks good  every woman I avoid like the plague.
aside from the cgI reminding me of final fantasy spirits within from 20 years ago  I think iam gonna enjoy this
amber heard has been let go by wb and her role in aquaman 2 has been cut down a great deal. she has said this today on the stand herself.
that pog face she makes while scrolling tinder is lowkey nightmare fuel
I think it looks kind of fun in my opinion
bet they not gonna nerf she-hulk like they did hulk
I actually think it looks fine. cute lovable melonie.
so everyone in banners family canturn into a hulk I dont know really anything about marvel characters other than basic stuff but I thought she got sick and needed his blood and that turned her into she-hulk.Im I just wrong
yeah  I dont know about that one. the cgI in the trailer reminds me of 2003 hulk  and boy  did that age like milk. thatsaid  its the second time I watch the trailer  and maybe I have to take off the negativity cap. maybe.the main reason why I dont have confidence in that is how current she hulk is in the comics  where she literally is female version of hulk. you could say she looks even more like a man. and while not being a diehard fan  I do know a bit about her origins  enough to know they wont do any of that in here. but oh well  its good to see melonie is at least positive about it. I ll probably end watching anyway four to five months after the series end because I have nothing better to do...edit  melonie is on giants team  let s go! thats two ytubers I follow now
not sure what is worse cgI she hulk or the ice cream truck car crash in moon knight
shrek is love. shrek is life.
hImelanie I wish we could see the whole statue of lara croft in the background
I didn t realise they were making another shrek movie. hopefully they will fix the dog poo cgI and we get a guest appearance from donkey aka eddie murphy lol.
hey mel  love what you did with your hair  you look amazing
I think trailer makes it look like a comedy or maybe satire
I just wanted what we had in that one fantastic 4 episode where johnny was flirting with her and she was sassy af if thats what we get Im down other than that nahhhh
youre not wrong. in the comics  jen gets shot by a thug the courts set free. so in order to save her life  bruce has to preform a blood transfusion. making jen the savage she hulk  it takes a while for her to control but gets the hang of it. she doesnt just become a hulk for the fun of it.
@viper sword  oh okay thanks for clearing that up for me.I was a bit confused lol
you deserve a complement for sticking to your own opinions instead of just jumping on the hate wagon like many content creators   my favorite thing about your channel is your authenticity   thatsaid I do disagree with your opinion on she-hulk I think that cgI looks cheep and almost make her look like a doll   honestly Ive seen action figures that looked more like people   valkyrie is a character I never liked to begin with so I fail to see the appeal . ps  english is not my main language so excuse any grammar mistakes.
your hair looks great mel.
after I seen this all I really could think was I really want to see a savage dragon movie. look at you and that tan you got going on.
she is swiping right on all off them! men    oh  isn t that how you use that app
as a fan and creator of cgI that cgI looked terrible for a hollywood studio with millions of dollars of equipment.
I love the way she-hulk herself looks!  she s got that tall sleek look from the comics!  this also seems like it could be the most comic-book accurate mcu hero yet  as this is exactly how she-hulk  and jennifer walters  is in the comics.  I thought for sure they were going to mess it up.  this makes me kind of happy!that was a great verse of the day  melonie!  I loved how you expounded on it.
she-hulk s existence is woke.   I know we like hulk  but what if he was a she    at least back then they tried to make it a new character instead of just claiming bruce banner became brenda banner.
there are very few youtubers I look to hearing from daily and you are too 3 for me last week was kinda boring without your tomb raI er Imean youtube videos lol
im with you on this one. others are tearing this apart and I admit the cgI could be better. maybe this just shows how deep the cultural rot goes but im just shocked they are making her hetero.
I also find it very strange going hulk makes her way more attractive.
love the natural hair!
the cgI on the face is a little weird but other than that I actually liked this trailer. also didn t like what looks like titania s outfit when she busts out of the wall.
I wanted sensational she-hulk  but got this instead. oh well.
good Lord! your hair! its perfect!
I think you would make good she-hulk.  that d be cool.
great to see you appreciating some of the trailer instead of just crying about the cgI like every other reaction video.
rule of thumb with any disney series is its always the third episode that goes woke  wait until 3 episodes are out and see how people are reacting before committing  as that is how they work  also in garry s video on it he mentioned how many subscribers they want to get over the next 2 1 2 years  a 100 million people  and with the way they act  expect more and many more bait and switches of that designalso its kinda funny to see what the target demographic thinks of the show  all the guys reviled in this on friday night tights  saying she looked like shrek and broke down the bone basic characterization of the hulk heresterotypical gay friend and all  like their impression was it was very paint by numbers  plus a good amount of the people in the comments were like why her and not that woman from rizzolI   isles  angie harmon  who has stated for about 10 years she wanted to play she hulkalso with thatsubtitle  you just know their hoping some of the harvey birdmen people perk up their ears and watch  and all I can say is  no dice  harvey birdman or nothing lol also death by snu snu  I had to look that up  God cant believe its been that long since futurama passed  and now those disney bastards have it and are gonna reanimate it like everything else.ugh  gotta love those people  disney buys everything  ftc gives no toss  elon buys tesla  and its alarm bells for monthsno wait  you know what Imean lolalso harvey birdman s first episode is up for free fyI  watch it and thank me latter lol
you know those girls that look good until they unfortunately open their mouths and talk that is this she-hulk.  perfect example
I cant help but think about harvey birdman  attorney at law. if its half as funny as that  I ll be a fan even with bad cgi.
follow up reaction jk...I think we all have a good idea of what it would entail.
this what s wrong with some people. having different set of opinions is now considered a hate crime. smh
exactly !!!!
yeah she looked great.
they are only leaving her hetero because they believe she is filling the masculine role in her relationship. she hulk was cool because she was different  but now that literally everything they do is like this  she s become a normie is the msheu. not different  not novel  not interesting. its too bad they have their  law written in stone   from feige  so you know they are going to hit the same points they ve hit in literally every disney plus show  except this is the one show that might have sorta warranted it.
this actually looks good am hyped for this now been a she hulk fan for som years now.
good morning melonie I just want to tell you that I am so sorry for this being late reply to your video but I just want to tell you that I think that this new she-hulk tv series show will be interesting to see and watch bc she got good tight legs structure and she is so buff and strong and she can pick up a human and carry them out with two arms. anyway I just want to tell you that I think that I will like this series and I hope you will like it too  ok melonie. anyway again I am so sorry for replying back late to this video chat and I hope you like my comment bout she-hulk  ok melonie. anyway hope you have a wonderful and great blessed day today at home with your pets and have a great day at the gym too melonie. anyway have a great day melonie.
they ll definitely be banking on simpery for this one idk I feel like they could ve done a better job with her to be honest
pewdiepie is the best flavour of g fuel - that is all
why couldn t they let the body double be the actress...I would have just watched it on mute then.   but seriously...im a huge john byrne she-hulk fan...his she-hulk is confident in who she is  so much so she decides to stay transformed...and she s funny af! but noooooo they couldn t adapt byrne s she hulk lol
I dont get the hate for this one. the cgI looks great to me.
the only thing that was a red flag to me was that the jokes were awful  as per usual with the mcu  but a little more so this time . otherwise looks potentially fine to me. Im in wait and see mode right now.
girl power!!!!!  I agree  women should support each other  not try to tear each other down.  but then you get cringy team up montages like the end of end game lol.
the part where bruce-hulk is telling the female thatshe needs to be angry   scared to trigger the transformation...and she says   anger   fear is the base-line for every woman.   imagine if a man had said that  what do you think the reaction would be   the left would be outraged and label it  sexism     hate  and demand that it be cancelled. there is also a scene where she-hulk is thumbing through male pics to select a date  and she comes across a pic that makes her mouth go agape...if you pause it  you can see its a pic of a man s mid-section with one hand above the navel and the other hand below...in other words  its a pic of the man s member. again  if the role s were reversed the left would be outraged  but when they do it then its fine. Im just so sick of the left s double-standards   utter hypocrisy.btwI dont hate the trailer like some do  I just get annoyed when the left puts out context that they condemn the right or males for doing  but applaud when their side  the left    women do it. I just cant stand hypocrisy.
I think melonie mac is a member of the tracksuit maffia.
I liked the trailer. it 100  has the vibes of the classic she hulk comics  and I loved how cheeseball they were. captain marvel should ve started the same way  like in the comics
girl power  real female power does not need to bash others. go boom!
new hair is
well  Imean technically angels  fallen or not  would be non-human rational intelligences not necessarily native to our planet. so  aliens  if not native .
love that hair! but yeah it legit looks like the cringe worthy fan art that people make when the actor is announced before the product even starts production.
11 50 so  brandonthe zealot doesnt believe amber is as crazy as johnny makes her out to be. while also try to link johnny deep to illuminatI conspiracy  either brandonthe zealot is a troll  or they have more issues than amber heard.
I didn t think it looked that bad  but I guess after all the trash disney  has been putting out scraps look appetizing.
so many red flags on this one right from the get go. my expectations are subterranean. will pirate to laugh along with the boys.
I dont mind girl power  as long as it isn t man hating.
she looks to just be a woman painted green and I am pretty sure she hulk is supposed to be more than just a green woman.
its about comic relief dude why do people these days need to have an issue with everything.
@the veggster good day  I get that its comic relief and I have no issue with comic relief. the problem is that only one side is allowed to get aways with it   the left   women  while the other side is always attacked   condemned for doing it  the right   men   which creates a level of anger   frustration. thus  I cant take seriously a product that is made by the very side that condemns my side for the very things it ridicules my side of doing. get it yet
she-hulk looks really nice  this athletic look really works  maslany seems to fit the role really well. but that line about  anger and fear  gave me batwoman cringe vibes. ... also ruffalo is annoying
the o.g. she hulk is awsome  this is everything but that. not to mention the writter they choose to rewrite her is as high on the trash activist list as one can be  which clearly showed trought this trailer . its starting to show all these financial flops are starting to hurt since this is the second movie in a row which looks pretty cheap. the more faillures like this the better.
ha! death by snu snu ftw!
kinda hard to make a she-hulk movie that couldn t possibly be conflated with girl power or the fem agenda. Imean  the point is thatshe s supposed to be strong. so.. but with everything being so polarized politically itseems inescapable with media. like with thor love and thunder  thor is floundering in confusion  doubt  etc on the side lines while  king valkyrie  and jane thor take up the mantles of authority.
06 41 thank you!
honestly  the only thing mcu I cared to watch was spiderman  and that is not even completely disney at all. otherwise  nothing from disney makes me excited to go watch it  especially since there is no clear end goal like there was the first three phases with thanos and the infinity guantlet. she hulk  while Im glad isn t the man with breasts as portrayed in some of the tecent comics  is yet another live action adaptation I dont care to see. could be good  could be bad  but there s nothing about she hulk that makes me want to watch this.on the comment of depp vs heard  it certainly seems one sided going the other way in favor of depp  so I can understand some suspicions. as said  it takes two to tango in a relationship. the problem is that heard s side has not provided one iota of evidence that depp was ever at fault  has totally lief about her own innocence  and has  in fact  tried to undermine the court to have things go her way. and now  it has come to the point where you cant trust anything she says. meanwhile  depp has provided actual proof and credible witnesses to prove his side as opposed to the  he said she said  narrative. heard has done nothing but shoot herself on the foot.
Im so done with marvel and star wars.  I watched 2 episodes of moon knight and I was out.  it wasn t so much about him  as it was his wife.  boba fett was more about fennec shand.  boba was a wimp and he wasn t even in 2 episodes.  they keep doing the bait and switch.  everything has to be super w0ke.  there is no more character development and the story telling is nonexistent.  she hulk will be a hard pass for me.  Im just wondering if marvel or star wars will ever get their act together and it will ever be worth watching again.
they made she hulk have curves  which is not something I expected.  I thought they would for sure give her the female face on a male body treatment.
the fact that in ancient times  giants being wrote about in basically every part of the world shows thatsomething big happened.  outside of scripture  others wrote about God wanting the giants to be defeated by people rising up against them because the giants are unnatural.  that ain t coinkeedink.also  according to matthew-24 31  Jesus Christ directly refers to the elect being on earth and in the heavens.  that  and  literally refers to life being elsewhere  life whom will enter the kingdom when they are gathered by the angels as well.  they simply are likely minding their own business  not trying to visit us.
a few months    ago it was posted online -- I do not remember where or by who -- that this show was going to be a comedy of sorts.  if that is the case...nope.
melonie finally took a rare l in my opinion
beep boop blah.I ll watch she-hulk  Im rarely not entertained by marvel.personally I think the Bible is a condensed compilation of ancient stories and abridged histories rewritten to give it a semi-cohesive narrative  glossing over other details and making itsimilar to the myths it was based on  but different. then the Christian mythos started up and built another narrative from a selection of verses in the hebrew text. my question would be  if we still have those among the celestial forces we have reason to believe are out there  who are still willing to aid us or fight on our behalf if we were again enslaved by those who possibly created us for slave labor  or just used us for labor and told us that was why we d been created.
at least they didn t make she-hulk a bbw
always enjoy your comments but Im sure marvel can screw it up. hope not but.............. mel you are awesome as always
what do you know about swiping right  I didn t know until you said it.
not sure if youread earlier post on another video but I will repost this again  last time I swear.  they want you to be poor  here s why  by george gammon. hint  your quotes are the only answer
Im surprised marvel let her be straight.
it looks kind of fun. but thats not enough to bring me back. if it was just no way home  then this  then gotg 3 I d still be in. but there is just too much garbage diluting the overall quality.
the way your hair looks is very nice and pretty
love the hair.
he needs to find himself... again... 3rd times the charm I guess
now that you said shrek that is all I can see.
yes!!!! preach!! fallen angels are aliens
bruh! is that halo needler leaning on your wall!  please show it!
do they understand she-hulk only dates people with superpowers so she wouldn t kill them  I have no problem with snu snu but this is not this.
I like tatiana maslany she was awesome in orphan black and I haven t watched a single disney plus mcu show but she hulk looks funny and has me interested. people seem to be hating for the sake of it everytime a show starring a woman comes out its sad and pathetic imo
Im ok with girl power if it doesnt get girl power though putting men down.
wish they painted someone like gina carano green for the she hulk scenes instead of the crap cgi
this cgI needs more work.
boom!!!
she hulk is hot.
my complain about she-hulk is she could ve been same size as hulk or the hulk could ve same slim as she-hulk!
I told you she s hot. Im not gay  but king valkyrie can have her way with me. lol get it  Im a guy and she a king. ok Im stupid.
also her height changes throw out the trailer
I was kinda hoping it would be a chick flick after the trailer.
as I said on the miss marvl trailer  the cgImake everything look weird  im not saying its bad  butt    look weirdI like this isnt the ultra monster muscular she-hulk  maybe if they use it as a  desperation  move could be cool  hope it isnt filled with ultra soy woke propaganda  I hope let itshine as they did with lokI and moonknight
new fan here
she looks good but still lacking in muscle department  they could add little more
shrek meets ally mcbeal
stop calling me a boomer
I see why your husband left you now
I love you.
this show looks like its for wine aunts thatsmell like cat pee  even got the humor that women like that would love.
tks mel for vid o beautiful new haircut
4 00 lol
heeeeey new melonie mac upload!
I think they cheaped out on the cgi. Im getting uncanny valley vibes.
no comment on the cgi
giants  are just dinosaurs!
cut. print. crap. way to go disney.
just completely apathetic at this point. the mcu is in shambles.
I will watch this over ms marvel. if for no other reason than I really like tatiana maslany. the cgI looks kinda rough. I would rather watch her when she isn t hulked out anyway.
to be fair...I was actually expecting shrek but we got a woman with a figure and the transformation with a feminine figure as well...
valkyries bewb armour isn t going to go down well with anita scamkessian     -     -
id better look for harvey birdman attorney at law instead.ps1  birdgirl attorney at law sucked azz   ps2  I bet even she hulk porn parody will be funnier xd some have good stories .
heh
when she said  anger and fear  was just the default state for women existing  I got so pissed off.  also the cgI is absolute garbage tier...
the cgI looks soo terrible imo.  they obviously aren t going to put the intersectional woke lines in the trailer  because that would ruin the bait and switch.
she looks good  but the cgI looks terrible for tv show run by marvel backed by disney.
Ive got to be honest I was expecting this she hulk thing to be nothing but woke misandristic propaganda because thats all the rage in hollywood now but it kind of looks like it doesnt take itself seriously which is probably a good thing.
my only complaint is I wish she was just slightly thicker. it looks like she skipped leg day and is a bit too stretched out and lanky for my preference of what she hulk should look like.  otherwise I like her personality and the comedy is spot on for a she hulk story.
cgI and premise seem cringe af
this looks worse than hulk 2003
women in the msheu need muscles. the comics has females with muscle but the movies have skinny girls. how canthey pick up cars and heavy stuff and never have gains.
she s a little uncanny valley for me. even hulk s cg isn t great. I think it needs more budget.
doesnt look good to me  that last scene was also cringey imo.
I do like the look but the dialogue....not so much.
really  you dont think the cgI looks like crap  wow.
the cgI is terrible she looks like the jolly green giant. kind of shocked they used mspaint to make this show.
a terrible sjw that works with my husband loves she-hulk. therefore Imust hate it.
jeebus  you had me interested until the God talk.
maa mhulk
plz make a video on the aliens
I agree. the trailer doesnt look bad to me at all. people are exaggerating big time. so what  anyone who is green now is shrek or fiona  wow  I didnt realize those movies just took over an entire color. people are being ridiculous here. it was a little woke but only a little. jeremy from geeks and gamers complained about her picking up a man. uuuh  shes she hulk dude. this is the one time where that is perfectly acceptable. and as for the cgI  who cares. comics dont look real either. wanting something like she hulk to look real is a little weird.
im sick of them making all marvel superhero movies into comedies... im gonna pass on this one.
I thought it was gonna be a feminist fest. I ll give it a look
more disney woke crap.....   the critical drinker did a good review of the trailer
cgI body from a low budget early 00s syfy channel movie
agreed. I think the  anti-woke  group side  which Im a part of  is overreacting. looks fun! enjoy something!
generic dramatic drums in transitions in trailers is getting lazy u_u
2 16 thatsmells of sjw victim culture.  those are like the base line of any woman existing.  it might be a fun movie. not watching it until hollywood as a whole gets off the woke nonsense.
she hulk is way op to be able to pick up a man she could throw him through a wall so that is a nitpick for sure.
I think this might be the most faithful adaptation of the character. only seeing will be for sure  she-hulk has always been a goofy comic  she breaks the 4th wall way before deadpool. I think most of the youtube creator haters  just like to hate on anything mcu  it drives clicks and views and makes them  money. just not sure how people can be toxic so much on both sides  it will rot their core sooner or later.  its really not a Godly thing to do.
how dare you not hate what other people hate. you should be ashamed of yourself.
first mcu disney   series that Im actually going to end up skipping. this nonsense looks just as bad as the other trash they have released on their platform. lol
this was horrid
cgI looks like trash.
why did you do bangs  thats the haircut of  the woke nazI s.
this trailer is trash.  az stated this is she-hulk in the city.  he is correct and the cgI is bad.
it looks soo cheesy and bad. the cgI is just as bad or worse then joss whedons josstice league cgi. I hate everything about disney s hulk they turned him into a weak joke   yes she looks like fiona. in the worlds of the wise and funny charles berkeley  its turrible
wrong. its woke me-too stuff trash. hulk in the city. re-watch.
looks trash. very poor cgi.
awful. just really awful.
ehhh  I thought the. cgI looks pretty bad. but not terrible  that. wasn t terrible but Im not impressed. she looks like princess fiona from shrek.
Im just glad the actress for she-hulk is not plus-size.
hey viperchief117  beware of this jealous lunatic that hide behind a berserk avatar   calls everyone including yours truly  spammers     spam bots his name is thedarkwanderer
