I played perfect dark for ages  it was one of my top 3 n64 games. joanna dark is already a badass perfect agent and futuristic superspy  already this awesome female original character  no need to  update  her and inject some ideological bullcrap that will make writers feel like grandiose moralistic activists. sadly  we re not in the age of creativity  we re in the flood. artistic expression  gaming  by extension  is on a stagnant phase for now. gaming could no be more different than in times when perfect dark came out  and they will have no idea how to carry the feeling of the og game. the only reason they want to plaster the  perfect dark  name is to get our attention and make us pay for their half-assed efforts  its the only thing they can do so far else we would not care at all.I say we ignore it completely  even if they bury the franchise. rather see it dead in the water than necromanced into a horrible mockery of what it used to be  like so many things that we carried nostalgia for.
the original perfect dark was as close to a 10 10 game for its time than any game has ever come.
I haven t seen your channel until just a few days ago and its really nice to see someone talking about video games thats also not an idiot. itseems like every game channel is woke and anti-male. also I like that you do verses because its nice to see someone actually being positive. a positive Christian gamer girl not being woke is unheard of these days. highest of respect to you.
ffffugh!! perfect dark is literally my all time favorite ip. I was actually sooo happy with where it was at  classic hidden gem. I loved the stealth tactics  the amazing story progression  the character developement. elvis is still one of the best protagonist in fps history. it was full  challenging  rewarding and it had incredible if not infinite replayability. I still dust off the old n64 a couple times a year and do some perfect agent missions or some sim battles with friends. its literally a perfect game. there is nothing amiss. the skeddar were amazing as a final arch enemy. they were mysterious and scary and soo satisfying to beat. I will probably make a point to forget this exists. halo was ruined. pokemon has gotten soft and pointless. cod is dead. tomb raider got woke. starwars has been gutted. marvel is a putrid garbage fire and from soft is the only proud developer left.
Im extremely worried about the perfect dark reboot too. as soon as crystal dynamics got involved  that was an instant red flag. I hope they dont touch no one lives forever as well.
I just cant be hyped about this game. now  tell me the actual original team  ge64  perfect dark  timesplitters  is making something  brand new ip  reboot  sequel  prequel  whatever  then Im stoked.
it was actually really fun looking at the old concept art! Im gonna have to go back and look at the concept art for old games to see some variety because everything does look  samie  with triple a games these days
I loved classic tomb raiders controls as well  because the game allowed for you to grow with those mechanics and controls before you actually got into the game play itself i.e. laura s mansion  and that was a lot considering that most games during the 90s did not offer a training course for the player.
I was hoping you would say youre afraid they re going to turn  perfect dark  into  perfect dork .
if this is true  I think the two reasons why this happens is that one  they believe changing female characters to be more  relatable  is to attract the typical or average women who are not like melonie and is attracted to different types of storytelling like drama  romance  and the world stories  and not a character or the hero journey stories. second  they are appealing to the aesthetic of being a geek and to cosplayers or fake geeks. however  the companies use the current trend of being woke and the media press as a shield to defend their bad business decisions for a product. but I do think there s a light end of the tunnel  and woke trend will end in about two or three years from now or sooner  depending on unknown factors we or I couldn t see.
great video mel  I grew up with perfect dark  the n64 game and then watch perfect dark zero get released which was okay.  there was a gbc game if I remember but limitations and all.  the remake on the 360 rare replay is nice and its good to hear a possible reboot will be made but it wouldn t surprise me if things are changed as the og game was 22 years ago and while Im hoping it isn t too far destroyed of what it used to be  it wouldn t surprise me.
on a somewhat related note  it really is a darn shame that forspoken is more than likely not going to get received all that well. frey holland seems like a fun  well-designed character. and its a shame that these characters keep getting wasted by games that are forgotten as fast as they get released. see  nillin from remember me  violett summer from velvet assassin  anya from stolen...
boomer boomer boomer boomer...go boom!!  Im gen x but Ive been called a boomer for years because of my beliefs  both political or religious . you using woke terminology and making it a positive  or using it against them  gives me a smile.
people upset about being called  boomers  on here should be happy that melonie didn t name the channel something else. think of all the words that end with  -ers  and imagine how much worse it could be.
you hit the nail on the head with a lot of your thoughts about video games these days. particularly the whole hand holding in lots of western games  the overabundance and reliance on cut scenes  and finally all the woke bullshit. when it comes to cut scenes my all time favorite game since I was 7 has been final fantasy 7 and what se did with the remake imo is honestly spectacular  though I think there was that whole controversy about tifa and her chest... but I digress  every time in the original when you got a cut scene it felt earned and was a treat. while other games now a days just throw them at you when they aren t needed. I would love it if game designers would stop catering to the loudest vocal minority who are offended by every little thing  especially when it comes to female characters that they create  why cant we have a sexy  intelligent woman as a protagonist  I d play a game that has a sexy female character as the protagonist  however I ll avoid a female protagonist thats deliberately made less attractive to appease again the vocal minority.
Ive watched your vids off and on for years and years. its great that with this channel you feel like such a breath of fresh air. do you!
I love your content format because it always leaves me with so much to want to comment on but dont want to over post.  you have the topic  then you have a comment  then there is a verse to discuss and my mind has things to say in all these areas to engage in.  its working really well.  I wanna talk about pd but then the boomer comment came up and thats where this comment has to go.  your rational for using boomer is spot on perfection.  itsays a lot about those who dont like it and its now also so diluted it doesnt mean anything.  it was redefined by the young incorrectly and now you are redefining it again for the better.  my father is a boomer  a specific group non-derogatory  Im gen x  the good ol   loser generation.   I could argue I feel ignored as a counter point but that is dumb.  millennials are the current mid-life gen and needs to take the reigns and define life at this point or get run over by these younger gens. you ll begin to also cater your hard work to the young minority demands showing how soft you ve become.  I think becoming a parent kind of does that too  but diff topic .  it defines nothing. . .as a  mac go boom  fan  we embrace being your boomers and nowhere else.  in the words of the woke   maybe this opinion piece content is not for you. .   but the anti-woke doesnt push people away.  I guess that makes us the true inclusionaries!
found your channel recently and I loving it it nice to see there s a Christian on youtube thats not  just a preacher or a Bible study. Im glad I found your channel.
perfect dark  64  is one of my all time favourite games.. dont care much for any of the other s  perfect dark zero for example seemed to be made by completely different peoplethat being said when they announced a  new game  I had no hopes for it at all  first of the whole mission structure and gameplay of the original is something we only really saw with perfect dark  64  goldeneye  64  and maybe timesplitters  ts2 specifically .. and I dont think they are even trying replicate itI did watch some interview when they announced the game and the developers didn t seem to care much for the original game past  strong female character   so I didn t even follow the development  I dont like  modern fpss  that much  and itseems like it will just be a generic story driven game.. that is atleast what I am expecting
how can we make joanna better    shave her head  square her jaw  and make her a monotone  grim faced shell.   yes! how original!
amen.
yep
yeah  melonie is unique!
agreed its a breath of fresh air too see!
woke  as a term is so vague that its basically unusable in conversation. your idea that  itseems like every game channel is woke  is hard to interpret because the word means so many things to many different people  and I cant tell specifically how you mean it.I get using it a video title for seo purposes  but using it to make a point as though it has any definable parameters is laughable. is it that hard to find a clearer way to get your point across  or do you just use the word with no compunction because its in the zeitgeist  Im truly curious.
@daniel zealthe term  woke  is not vague. it just encompasses a broad range of ideas. thats why he used the term. it does have clear definable parameters. you know the definition of the term is in the dictionary. but to make it easy for you  here s wikipedias definition. itshould suffice  woke    wo k  wohk  is an english adjective meaning  alert to racial prejudice and discrimination  that originated in african-american vernacular english  aave . beginning in the 2010s  it came to encompass a broader awareness of social inequalities such as sexism  and has also been used as shorthand for left-wing ideas involving identity politics and social justice  such as the notion of white privilege and slavery reparations for african americans.  I think its pretty clear what he meant with that word!
@daniel zeal  anyrging they dont like or agree with is considered  woke . its just an excuse for whining
@underthegun897  kind of like  anyrging  that doesnt cater to your feelings is a ist or a phobe
@dustin lawson  yep exactly  anything they feel offended by they have to call  woke  or say its pandering. yet then praise the stuff they like that does the exact same thing
yes  I totally agree! its so sad how all these classic franchises have been gutted. I d say form soft  and cdprojectred are the only proud developers left.I also love perfect dark. did you know there s a remastered version of perfect dark n64 on the xbox one  and series x. that way you dont have to always play on old hardware you know lol.
@fast0025ify  cdpr caused one of the biggest let downs of them all. cyberpunk was and still is unsalvagable garbage. 60hrs of my life wasted. I also am definitely familiar with the rare replay collection. I play on the old hardware for the feel of it. my childhood existed for the snes and the sega gen and n64. turok may be the only ip that hasn t been totally thrashed yet honestly. the 360 reboot wasn t that bad imho.
I feel that.  my friend has the n64 perfect dark we d usually do some pvp whenever I was visiting.everything you said about those ips though  I wholeheartedly agree.  especially pok mon.  I love thatseries  and I loved making complete battle teams--but the games got too bloated with nonsense  and the game never grew up. grew up in just not being hand holdy which gets tired.the only time I wanted to dip my toes back into it is omega ruby  but aside from that its a major rip on all of those franchises.  I wish I had played the first battlefronts.
its funny because I was going to add cyberpunk and cdpr to my list of unmitigated dumpster fires  but its not a beloved ip like the others are  so it didn t feel like it belonged on the list
I loved turok evolution for gamecube and the original xbox. such a fun game! cdproject still has the witcher series. which is still loved and highly regarded.and I definitely dont agree that cyberpunk is totally unsalvagable. many still enjoyed the game even with all its flaws. cdpr is still working on it. they just released a big next-gen patch for it. there is an active modding community for the game. and cdpr is working on expansion content for the game.I honestly thinking the biggest mistake of cdpr was just that they released the game too early. they should have waited another year to release it. but also the hype from the community was a problem. I think some people had too high expectations for cyberpunk. I never expected such a big game to be perfect on release. thats why I waited to buy it until its been fully patched.
thats fair.
love your content! people need to understand that not every game is for everyone. why so many people get so butt hurt cause you prefer a different type game than they do just blows my mind! I have a different preference of games than you  but still love watching your content and hearing your opinion about the games you prefer. just cant understand why people are so offended by literally everything all the time  everything woke turns to shit! I stand with you and against the entire woke movement! love ya mel!!
love perfect dark on n64 the music score was dope
thanks for show-casing the old perfect dark games... and yeah  the various historic versions of joanna dark does look  bangable   Im just using that expression to trigger ms. fourskinn  -
I appreciate your input to my superchat on last night s toxic femininity and planning on using it into a video that follows-up on the topic soon so stay tune
19 35 ok  youreally surprised me when you pulled that up. lol and I agree 100  on what you said there. never feel like you have to  apologize  or be ashamed when speaking about Christ!I just found your channel via this video  joanna s such a freakin legend! . you have another subscriber.
my expectations for this game being good are absolutely 0. I just know they are gonna make perfect dark unrecognizable  add quick time events  have tons of cutscenes  and ruin our girl and also possibly make it woke. you be looking absolutely fabulous today by the way.
badass  I wouldnt describe joana dark that way  she was more an open  caring british spy operative type  determined and capable who was friends with that alien from area 51  and I played the xbox 360 arcade version of it just about half a year to a year ago so my memory is still fresh  never played the second one  although I have gamepass and some free time and I should do that.but perhaps that is the most memorable thing about her in that game  she wasnt really your sterotypical genderswitched eastwood type  just kinda seemed like a normal chick who was an operative or a spyand yeah theirs the sex appeal thing but it wasnt the focus of the charachter  she was attractive but not overdone  well outside of that level where she sneaks into a party in an evening dress  but hey that was kind of the point in that level and she did look damn good like that honestlybut it wasnt overdone or crazy like they did with laura  like it gave some variety to the landscape with thathell honestly she s like one of two or three female characters in that era that was like that really  cate archer her  and konoko from onI really  where it wasnt your blatent sex appeal for marketing speak type thinglike say what they did with unreal 2 I rememberalso judging by that photo there at 8 05 I think their gonna black widow her  where the personality is downturned to the point where the phrase black widow is only applicable in name only to hervs her in her original render there where she seems to be eminating the look of the lead singer of garbage  shirley manson  actually even the perfect dark zero render has strong vibes of her now that I think of it.like maybe the lead designer had a thing for her
I am a little nervous about this new one coming out. granted we have no idea when.
og perfect dark is a classic I really hope they stay true to the original and keep that amazing music
I swear to all things if she has a freaking bow and arrow in this game  I ll go crazy.
I am not religious but I find your verse of the day is always interesting and anybody can relate to the truths contained in them.
perfect dark was my favorite n64 game by far. zero wasn t anywhere near as good but I still loved the game. joanna was probably my first video game character crush actually.
my wife said they turned her into  joanna dyke  rather than joanna dark.  my wife knows her 0  other than from being in the room with this video.  thatsays it all to me.  and I agree.
not good when people leave the project. I always get the feeling of  passed back and forth from director to director to save it.  feel to it also nice that leon kennedy got to stand in for jo in those new shots of the game. so nice to see he s still getting work in this day and age. jokes aside  I loved perfect dark but I do not have high hopes for this.
I love the verses you share! living by the Bible  living the way God designed us to  is such an act of rebellion these days its insane
ah  perfect dark. from the halcyon days of fpss! Im feeling too nostalgic now  I need to dig out my n64.
I just randomly found you out of nowhere  and I think Im a fan.  I agree with the complete bs that today s gaming media and much production is going.  its hardly anything new  but it just keeps getting worse.  Im more a fan of the final fantasy shining force langrisser scene than perfect dark or halo  but we see the same kind of thing there.  the big publishers are pushing themselves down the drain  and indie devs are making a comeback.also  I was not expecting a  verse of the day  at the end of each video  but bless you my sister for your faith!  do not abandonthe faith nor hide the light!  as my pastor pointed out just a couple days ago  you dont usually shine a light for the light to be seen.  rather  you shine a light so that you can see something else!  keep shining the light on what the word has to say about today s culture!
my biggest fear is that perfect dark is going to be woke. we cant have a strong woman that is also hot and sexy. sexy female or strong woman. we cant have both of them.
love perfect dark. personally  I like it more than goldeneye since rare developed both games but I liked the originality more of dark  plus I haven t really watched many james bond films xp  Imean  comeon  you cant go wrong with an alien named elvis.
it is hard to say if the developers will make the game woke because the concept arts and cgI trailers are not showing finalized versions of the game and character. they are most likely placeholders until the actual trailer of the game shows us a finished version of the main character and the game.
love your avatar!
@cylenx   thank you very much!!
everything woke turns to shit  is also an opinion.
@mandosaur  yes it does
is
its just more proof to me that we re living in a society where everything people complain about is adjusted just for them so they can feel included or so they aren t offended  everyone is basically king george these days. not everything is made specifically for yourself  might be shocking to realize there s some things not made for you. deal with it.  people who dont like being called boomer
perfect dark was a good game. had some flaws but still fun.
I do want the hot lara and joanna models but I do also like that they re moving more tactical too
sometimes I think that this joanna dark would be like the daughter of john wick and natasha romanoff  black widow  and I find it very interesting anyway to wait for the game  this reboot is going to be interesting.
I loved perfect dark. played it a lot more than golden eye. I seriously hope they dont screw this new game up.
perfect dark is one of my favorite games  certainly my favorite n64 game  hands down.
so you r expectations are like me after a night of drinking . btw  question before all the troubles with vampire bloodline 2 were you looking forward to that one aswel   and did you ever play the first 2 vampire games
sister  youre not kidding about them messing up the controls on angel of darkness.  the pc port of underworld seemed to have some issues when it came to gameplay as well.
bioshock  the first one  doesnt really have cutscenes and its got one of the best stories in any video game ever  as well as one of the best plot twists in gaming history.
rare s not really interested in doing anything with their old ip. thats why they handed them off to other studios  killer instinct  battletoads  and now perfect dark .
thats the spirit melonie dont give up dont give in be who you are
perfect dark and golden eye are my earliest memories of playing shooters. its hard to stay hopeful
the anita sarkeesian s  the zoe quinn s  the zoe kravitz s  the brianna wu s  the jack thompson s  the sam maggs  the neil druckmann s  the zombiunicorn s  the phil fish s  the tim schaefer s  the marcus c. evans jr. s  the jonathan mcintosh s   the david jaffe s of twitter want to ruin  uglify  bastardize   destroyeveryone s happiness  fun   joy all because they couldn t handle a few mean tweets   make everyone feel miserable as they are
I cant remember the perfect dark story but remember the multi-player.  briefcase turret for the win.
they still haven t changed my top broad of gaming  samus aran. she remains the same  in dread she was reinforced with the only time Ive heard her speak in a classic 2d metroid game  she almost sounded like the female version of snake. to the point  dont worry about it I ll take care of it. thats my samus.
l  for one  enjoy the fan name of  boomer.   playing the uno reverse is the best way to hit back at sjw types. as someone who grew up in a Christian household  but is not one myself  I really appreciate your Bible segments. whatever it is you do makes it connect with me a lot more than sitting in a pew for how ever many hours and going to sunday school ever could. I dont know about how the original tomb raider a played  I never owned a playstation while they were relevant  but I can understand not liking the controls if they came out before the dualshock controller  for the younglings in the audience  the original ps1 controller didn t have any thumbsticks until a few years after launch.  its part of why I never could get into megaman legends when I tried to rent it from blockbuster. needing to rent the system meant it was only for special times  so I had to pick games much more carefully. when I felt the tank controls didn t fit what I wanted megaman to play like  and it felt unnecessarily clumsy  I stopped trying to rent it in favor of games that felt better like megaman x4. is there any comparison here  I dont know  but that makes sense for me.
I really hope perfect dark doesnt go woke. perfect dark zero s joanna dark was so sexy and badass. loved that game.
Im a gen xer  and I normally hate being mistaken for a boomer. but on this channel  my wife and I feel like its meant as a term of endearment.
they gave her the karen haircut. this might actually be funny. at first I was depressed but now Im interested to see where this goes.
thats so funny. I never even made the  boomer  connection. I swear I just roll with things sometimes.
I would say its safer to guess they will screw this up. if you can butcher lc  you can butch up anyone. I think this will help gamers stop buying games under their hype and then complaining how bad the game is. how the devs screwed it all up. when thatshould be expected. wait until 1k gamers review it  steam reviews   metacritic . then go   buy from there. saved me a lot of money.
Ive never even owned goldeneye but my brother and I played perfect dark s multiplayer for countless hours.
not to mention that the original teams that created those ips aren t with the company anymore
crystal dynamics made legacy of kain  soul reaver.best story ever.they need to continue that!
never apologise for your faith or for sharing it. I love the Bible verses and you have encouraged me to share more
they gonna be in some trouble... thats one of my wife s favs. she pays attention to games credits  and she holds grudges.
classic tomb raider had precise controls for precise jumps...but then the level designers had to go and be pricks with hidden spike pits and other evil  evil traps you wouldn t know about until you fell into them.
gonna watch this later but I gotta say its so cool to run into someone else who follows dr. jolynne whittaker!
the original game is one of my favorites. I am scared to see what they do to neuter her in the next game. Ive played every game and have so many awesome memories of them. og is just a beautiful character all round.  I think its hilarious that people dont get the play on words with boomer. we all will be boomers some day. hopefully not the l4d versions though.  dark souls would be good without the stamina bar  that person sounds like a kotaku  journalist.
there should be a world woke awards where self-glorifying narcissistic celebrities and game developers or hollywood producers can go up there and shame everyone in their acceptance speeches while letting you know how great and enlightened they think they are. I would just love to see how bad the ratings would be.
4 14the best thing microsoft ever did with banjo-kazooie is hand them back to nintendo to put them in smash bros ultimate.
Im replaying silent hill 2. Im in the nightmare hotel now and Jesus its depressing. the soundtrack is amazing.
you seem to not like the reboot trilogy as much anymore. I remember you defending shadow of the tomb raider when it released  very good game too . Im more so curious cause I think Imissed something lol!do you still like the games but not lara s model
15 55 made during a time when we were still figuring out how to make a 3d game control  both movement and camera wise  and its painful to go back and play them today especially if you have no nestalgia for them  good games but controls of their time.
im 99  sure the franchise goes woke  the little that we saw pointed in that direction  hair cut and clothing  and since its about   climate change  im sure it will receive a huge doses of woke. not to mention gallagher the studio head of the initiave indeed wokefied lara croft tomb raider and been working on it from the get go way before crystal dynamics came on board. in all honesty. all of this cant come as a surprise. its good to see there is still an o.g. lara croft tomb raider community allive and kicking   .
that new overall look really gives off  can I speak to your manager  vibes.
yay... macdrop lol. excited for the next stage of the gfuel madness!!
hey  microsoft had its fair share of  bangers  with halo infinite and forza horizon 5. also  battletoads was only licensed through rare and developed through another team. rare s been too busy with their sea of thieves to break away...which really has me wondering why they aren t working on perfect dark. Imean  aren t they perfect for it...   not a pun! I swear!  d
I barely played perfecf dark once  I think just a short multiplayer battle. should have played it all through.but I think by then I was in the military and I was into some pc gaming  big  big into star wars and started my lego collection of ships and characters etc.before I got rid of most of that  before I started again... xd
I dont know if the game will be woke but whenever I see that particular short haircut it increases the chance  for me  that it will probably be somewhat woke. as long as its subtle and not in your face I guess its fine  if the gameplay is solid I can skip through the story anyway. either way Im checking it out because I have game pass on pc so why not.
woke female character   femininity     --------------- masculinity            -  woke male character     femininity            - masculinity     ---------------
probably seems like most of the game devs are doing the woke thing hopefully that changes.
the only gaming system I had growing up was my n64  so joanna dark was my lara croft. I do not want her to be a dang soccer mom! I want a dual-wielding minx in a catsuit.
ooh I didn t realize that about battletoads  that makes sense then!
@melonie mac go boom  sure! it was developed by dlala studios. rare stamped their name on it but thats about it.
those teaser images of joanna in the new perfect dark make her look like a police detective from a television show. nothing about her particularly says  joanna dark  based on how we have already seen her depicted. itseems odd to change up her look  and potentially her behavior  when the perfect dark games have been limited to very few installments  many years apart. why make her feel so generic  when she isn t the original perfect dark is one of the best nintendo 64 games. the xbox live arcade remaster that was on the xbox 360 was very nice too  though some character model redesigns looked odd  in my opinion. but the game was still solid. since that game is still so remembered and cherished  why make a big deal out of a new installment if our protagonist is potentially not going to resemble her in any way  it gives the impression that the developers and publisher believe they can reboot the franchise in a manner where it doesnt matter what they do to it. at that point  why should old fans return  the fact that a new game has the name logo  perfect dark  slapped onto it  if a new audience is desired  what is going to make the joanna in this perfect dark stand out from the other  similarly designed female protagonists  what s going to make her and the game not feel like a copycat I never played perfect dark zero  or the game boy color perfect dark  just to mention it   which I heard wasn t all that great  so my love of the series really just comes from the original game. if this new perfect dark is nothing special  or at worst  unappealing  then Im better off just replaying the original when I feel like it  accepting that it was never meant to go beyond thatsingle entry.
hey melonie. discovered you with the start of your new channel. you ve always been easy on the eyes . but your slightly different hair is catching my eye today. looking good. enjoy your takes and hope you have much success.
the issue is the picture are from the back or side and very dark so cant realy say to much at this point word of advice with I see you tubers do sometimes is they jump the gun to fast and you might be right but lets wait till we see better pictures.
perfect dark was good shit back in n64 days
the break from the break mob. its when we  get to heaven and sit at  that banquet table!
ps controller controls were a huge part of game development concepts.   its actually a divide in its own modern issue.  for example   dark souls fighters genre include the parry concept  or button tap counter concept is imperative to the mechanic of gameplay yet the same modern gamer gen   should auto grab  auto detect  auto target   trigger some scripted event program to remove player control and include laziness for casuals .  it is ok  you can fall off the cliffs 20-30 times trying to master that portion of the game  its teaching you while you do it and makes the game memorable.  and Ive posted enough so let s not start on cut-scenes in gaming. . completed budget waste to hide lack of game content and coherency.
short girls can be hot too short girls with the right proportions can be very hot. petite. absolutely necessary. Im shallow. sue me.
is she wearing mom jeans also  bayonetta gonna be towering over these ladies...
if melonie was to make a tomb raider game the enemy group would be called the wokies! haha
please no more shaved side hair on women!! can we put an end to this trend !
wow  the last time I played perfect dark was on the n64. been a while.  p
perfect dark is my favorite game of all time  the n64 one not zero lol  and I have 0 faith in this industry to deliver anything other than a bastardized game leeching off the pd name. it will release unfinished  full of woke-ness  and will not at all remotely resemble a perfect dark game other than names of characters etc. Im sure they will throw in some  pre-order now for the classic joanna carrington institute outfit  altered to avoid any male gaze of course  and laptop gun skin!  crap. elvis and mr. blonde will be paid dlc  daniel carrington will be turned into daniella carrington  and the datadyne ceo will be some sort of donald trump stand-in.
I knew it would when I saw the first reveal lol
I really need to play the classic tr games. do I need to get a classic console or is there a modern system to play on  I should check ps3 virtual console since I still have thatsystem.
beautiful  Christian  and a gamer   what s not to like
its crystal dynamics  so we will get the spaceballs stunt doubles for characters
perfect dark is my favorite shooting game but I have no faith in the new perfect dark game but we always have the old perfect dark games we can play
to be honest  thought that was leon from residential evil with brown hair in new concept art.  definitely prefer old school style characters
personally  Im perfectly ok with being a 32 year old boomer
reboot joanna s outfit kind of reminds me of jesse faden from control  except with worse hair.
dont be too sure about bayonetta 3. during the gameplay reveal she didn t become half naked while doing wicked weave attacks  the hair didn t change her clothing.
@demonknight94  I just meant her legs...
I call it the bogbrush or a dead rat and yeah its an haircut that looks ugly both on men   women. its like some spivhead s glands with abnormal pubic growth.
@marcus kahn  hahaha I like all of those terms and totally agree! where did this hair style first come from
in this context Im more than happy to be called a boomer
get good scrub  I fkn love this chick.  you have my sub
last picture looks more like the main character from control than perfect dark
this channel is fantastic Im glad to have found it. I know what its like to have franchises I once loved be taken over by assholes trying to use it as a platform. being a fan of something used to be so fun. Im tired of seeing franchises I get into get completely changed and than Im expected to just accept it. by the way as a fellow irish person I dont understand why people give you shit for claiming to be part irish.
what s your favorite Godzilla movie  what did you think of the recent Godzilla movies
I worked on that project as a freelancer about a year a go. I hope the woke shite is not true  it didn t seem so at the time but then again the story elements were not exposed to us
Imean they screwed up joanna dark before when they changed her from british in the first game to american in the prequel so messing things up again would just be par for the course.
another childhood memory getting corrupted to attempt to delete the past..
the art looks like the new resident evil games  takes away the identity of the game   reminds me of the 2000 s when all military shooters were just shades of brown  you couldn t tell one game apart from the other
I have played perfect dark a little bit maybe they dont make it woke but they probably will
I always wanted to play  but never had an xbox. her comic was good. black widow meets bladerunner is a good concept.
the only tomb raider game that messed up the controls was angel of darkness and that is because they printed the the booklet before the game was finalised and everything changed so the book didn t jive with the game controls just a little oops.
for some reason I thought the shadowy figure in your thumbnail is bully maguire
I honestly think its just a matter of art style. the exaggerated long legs  perfect curves  etc  are fine if itsuits the exaggerated art style of the gamewhich is what tomb raider used to do to an extent  though I would argue it kind of did an awkward mix which actually wasn t great . lara was cartoony.the current fad today is realism. which is fine too  but not everyone will like realism just as not everyone liked the cartoon look.sticking wurst tomb raider  because I know more about it than perfect dark   I thought the reboot was great. at least the first game. a bit of an uncharted clone but stillthey took a more realistic art and story style. which upset some folks. but they were trying something different for the seriesto say they made lara look less attractive  I think  is a little unfair. they made her look like a person capable of doing the things she does.  super models might look hot but they aren t soldiers  but I think fit women are hot. and the only people with the exaggerated features of lara croft irl can be attractive too ... but again  cartoony tl dr  I dont see a change of art direction  as a bad or woke thing. I see it as a change of art direction.its fine to not like that change  I just think its a bit extreme to blame it on wokeness every time.anyway  love your vids. keep doing you  melonie!
if someone doesnt like what is in your videos  they can make their own.
when I see a western aaa game trailer I keep my expectation low bcuz it might be woke or many bugs and glitches
perfect dark is still a thing
I called it when they announced it. no way it wont be.
I dont know that game but Im looking forward for farm 51 ww3 its a pretty good military shooter it out ranks bf2042 . good video though I wish video games go back to the good old days and  have good stories and adult humor but yeahyeyeyeye !
boomer and proud of it!
this is giving me a little bit of hope at least
did you work as a tester  artist  programmer
@adam unfriended  programmer  we signed a heap of ndas so I dont know if Im allowed to say what game engine
@kenneth maclean  did the workplace feel welcoming for people who had different political views   or did you notice any changes your co-workers taught about woke or inclusive changes to the workplace  is the pendulum swinging back to the center and returning to  normal   I know you signed your nds and cant say much about the time you worked there  but have you seen any new art or communicated with an artist  or at least heard rumblings from someone about the art direction confirming or denying it  being woke mess.last question  since you worked in the game industry. do you have any advice for someone like me who has an associate s video game design but has been out of the game for a while because of personal and financial reasons  Im sorry for asking too many questions. Im curious about the state of the game industry  and Im getting tired of antI woke and woke stuff because Ive been in this scene since 2012 when atheism   started this whole woke thing. however  I believe that woke trend is ending soon but dont know how soon though.
@adam unfriended  it was during the peak of covid so everyone was working remotely  all interactions I had with the team were purely business. the scope of this game is huge  I was only one tiny part
crystal dynamics would still be on top if they still made gex and legacy of kain games.
wow melonie has abs.
if they got laura c.  they ll definitely get joanna d.
this has nothing to do with the topic but everybody should check out colter wall he does folk  country and western music and he s really  really good imo
once again I scroll down and you appear on my screen and it puts a smile on my face.
so you ve got an fps with an iconic woman mc in a skin tight bodysuit.  own it and it cant go wrong.  they probably wont though.
I hope elvis makes an appearance.
she strongly resembles lara croft in my opinion
melonie  there s nothing wrong being Christian its just people who cant put differences aside
they now made this personal
halo infinite was great! Im really hoping that they dont follow in sony s footsteps though.
are people really so brainwashed about baby boomers that they are upset that melonie calls her audience  boomers  in reference to the name of her channel
boomers makes think about the faction in fallout new vegas lol. I like it.
crystal dynamics went to shit after the last legacy of kain game  and when hennig left  and then steadily went woke.
I wouldn t be shocked if they made into a soccer mom look God forbid they make a girl sexy anymore. look what they did too cortana..  fyI I rather have the sexy girls then the plain jane guys but thats just me
hey mel I just want to say that microsoft had a fair of sharing with two games of halo infinite and forza horizon 5 with bangers of going woke  ok mel. anyway also I dont know bout perfect dark bc I have not heard of the game or company  ok mel. anyway I just want to tell you that bout this topic  ok mel. anyway I hope you have a wonderful and great blessed day at home with your pets and have a great day at the gym if you have time to go today  ok mel. but if you dont go to the gym today then have a great day   evening at home  ok mel.
looks like design and production nightmare if this is the 2nd time a director quit. I barely remember perfect dark but it might not be a fully lost cause. microsoft is in a weird spot with bill gates still being an old liberal  he s kinda not on board with the new age bs and also because it looks like he doesnt want to lose his company to wokeness. but he is a crazy wef world economic forum  psycho  he wants control so at best the game is going to be tame in terms of sex appeal just like halo. they killed off cortana and replaced her with weapon who is essentially cortana in full military uniform  clever way to censor her through story.
I think I ll start a game company and call it misogyny works
people that dont like playing as hot women are weird to me. Imean  if given the choice  I dont always play as a woman  but like.... video games are a firm of escapism where you can use your imagination with things. why not play as something different than what you are in real life  idk  people get weird about the strangest things lol
Im 42. so if someone calls me a boomer I know Im doing something right. and if someone gets mad  thats just a bonus.
Im just struggling to believe she s 35 years old! whatever that girl s secret is  she needs to bottle it and sell itshe ll make billions
microsoft employees named their pronouns on a promotional video they did about half a year ago or so  or is it a year already  its going to be woke as hell  and crap!
the car shot looks like generic action shot. as does the pyramid shot. I dont play female avatars  but absolutely agree with you about the iconic looks and I despise the anita sarkeesian effect on the gaming industry.
characters used to have character and uniqueness. all these new movements propping up essentially want everyone to be the exact same  and not in a cool way  in a very generic boring way.
9 46 that hairstyle gives me lesbian-that-hate-all-men type of character vibes
a question   2nd question for your channel  a question for  even  good for the  atheist or  the religious - the question is this   how far into hell are is one willing to  try  and save single soul   and will one sacrifice one s soul in order to save another soul
in the thumbnail  she looks like a cartoon version of the nanny.
yes the wokies are so hurt by words. evidently they were never taught  sticks and stones will break your bones  but words will never hurt you!
Im such a sucker for pixie cuts. if a woman can pull it off to me thats extra points for hotness. dont care what they say about pixie cuts these days  I love that hairstyle on women. I am worried they ll do my girl jo dirty in this  reboot ... pd zero was such a letdown and I was all excited when they dropped that teaser a couple of years back.
she actally looks alot like you minus the hair colour. 7 19
I always play games as a girl. on some games it gives you an advantage because female hitboxes are smaller. everyone in public pvp servers in ark is a tiny black woman because it makes you hard to see and hard to hit.
git gud  scrub   . I haven t heard that in a while. but its true. want the glory  pay the price!!!
Im guessing she will have a lobotomy  strong woman  haircut.  based on the attitude of the current head of microsoft xbox games - you can guarantee that this new version is going to completely be a ball-busting affair with shades of tokenized lesbianism in order to pay tribute at the altar of activism.  probably full of qtes as well and all manner of gameplay assists to make it more  accessible I remember playing perfect dark very clearly.  it was really was goldeneye but on the next level.  and that made itso so good!
everything about the upcoming perfect dark game isn t giving me confidence
boom! boom!! boom!!!
perfect dark going woke  doesnt it already have a strong female protag
well they recently lost their director so thats not good news
xbox put s on a nice smile but if you look deeper you ll see a nightmare of mismanagement and a fundamental lack of understanding for what their fans want out of their top franchises. I just watched that reveal trailer and I dont see anything good coming out of it. but who knows  maybe it will be better than I expect. definitely not pre-ordering.
so I guess I should point out that they tried to recreate dante from devil may cry with a dark short-haired variant and that never really flew. nobody liked it and the game died in the shadow of mediocrity. why are they doing it with lara croft in tomb raider and joanna dark sp  from perfect dark been in love with these femme fetales and to be honest its not a lustful thing as a guy  of course it can be   its mostly making these girls  dreamy  and as a young boy I was falling in love with these kinds of characters. if I am honest  I am still in love  seriously in love  with these characters strong  womanly attributes. I dont want to see them disappear!
joanna dark as in jeanne d arc
I wonder if this ties into the industry s anti-anime mindset as well xd this focus on hyper  realism  and backing away from fun and fantastical exaggerations of the fantasy sexiness. a big reason I rarely play male characters is because they are uninspired and dull while the females were always attractive. but in games like blade and soul I can make male characters look good in that fantasy attractiveness way. yet the west wants to back away from that for these  inclusive  and  realistic  models  no thanks.
5 out of 6 people recommend russian roulette.the other 1 was ukrainian.  tastelessjoke
I also love when a woman does a pixie cut or similarly short hair cut   manages to still look totally feminine. case in point  audrey hepburn!
@darthgorbag  great example. and yes  any length of short hair as long as a woman still looks feminine is also fine by me.
what s wrong with having accessibility options
phil spencer has a hands-off approach in this project or future game products. he has said he would let his studios follow their vision of the game they are making without the meddling of the shareholders or money-grabbing producers  or too much input from him. if anything he said in the past few years triggered you  know all thatshit he or others have said are pr noise for show nothing more than that. chill and calm down  everything will be ok.
bam bam baby!!
they got to make her a very outspoken lesbian and anti-male character. or something else within the woke category.
thats not what woke is
having a strong female protagonist isn t woke. are you telling me sexy old school lara croft is woke  woke is having a mary sue female character that is perfect at everything and talks down to male characters.
love how not-woke you are! keep on being you!
when people not liking  boomers  referring to your viewers makes me think about how ignorant they are about how they frame their complaint.that last one about making it feel like your viewers are  oldies   so that person is self conscious about liking content because it may seem like your demographic is older   why does it matter what the other viewers are like for that person individually to like content classic group think mentality  feeling awkward if everybody else isn t like them.
she just looks like jesse faden from control from the back now.
I really liked both perfect dark and perfect dark zero. xbox s direction has sadly been going towards a lot of corporate  political virtue signaling and their staff on twitter are very obnoxious with pandering to woke malarkey. its like some bad parody of corporate culture. its one of the reasons Ive been more wary about what their games will be and how their systems are handled recently  despite their gameplay and produced content generally being far better than sonys malarkey . with thatsaid  I saw the trailer for perfect dark reboot and at the time they had some former sony developers who worked on it  the type usually more about messages   story  and producers of weak gameplay minus sunset overdrive  so that did raise some caution. also the reveal had johanna dark with the sjw hair cut  usually another red flag. I suspect it might be a bland daniel craig  modern tomb raider reboot clone that is politically corrected and watered down  similar to the craig era bond films. perfect dark and tomb raider games were at their best early on or the ones where trying to make games that tonally emulate the brosnan - classic bond era with more of an emphasis on gameplay. legends had a lot of james bond type stuff meets classic tomb raider. like sony and their malarkey  many of these game companies are filled today with those that aren t about games or gameplay  more about a message and pandering. the passion for the medium is just not there like it was. nintendo may still have that but other companies  not so much. elden ring has similar issues on the opposite side of the spectrum - poor gameplay and artificial difficulty under the false guise of challenge - when it is just tedium and bad game design propped up by internet  memes and journalists afraid to call it out - along with youtubers.
I like the cartoon looking one
for real  it was absolutely hideous on jill in the re3 reboot
sadly its a very safe bet that new joanna dark will be made into a yet another generic  bland   modern strong female character tm  .
im still shocked ppl write a comment in the video just to say they are offended by youreading the verse of the day...
I am guessing that george carlin is correct.   think of how stupid the average person is  and realize half of them are stupider than that. I knew from the onset that what you meant by  boomers .  the fact that people are confused that you call fans of a channel called  -go boom  a  boomer   astounds me.  it is like   if the brain were an app  people would use it on their crap-phone. .
amen. so dont like cut scenes.there s a reason some have skip buttons.just give me game play not a movie.
not good  perfect dark zero didn t exactly set the world on fire and that was back before any of this woke nonsense. the way I see it  the ip is already treading on the thin ice of irrelevance and obscurity. if microsoft is serious about pumping out a sure fire success then maybe dont go the tomb raider reboot route by handing it over to inept devs like crystal dynamics. also that haircut and the outfit they have joanna rocking in that piece of concept art you showed off at 8 40 has her looking like a karen. she s here to speak to your general manager son! and she means business this time!! lmao
re  perfect dark - I think what squeenix  and others  forget is that we partially buy games  on the vibe of the characters  scenery and motif.  we didn t buy the avengers because the characters had the look and feel of being like a bunch of dumpy cosplayers  meshed along with their dumpy woke character infusions.  no one buys that crap. hardly even bargain bin.now  if  modernizing  games and their characters means homogenizing and androgenizing characters   Im so out.  I like unique characters that draw us to the brink of amazing and fantastic.  I dont like dumpy   plain jane  characters  storylines and scenery.  I wont so far as f2p that kind of garbage.
dont woke me down with the phone
its simple for me  if reboot joanna looks like the female equivalent of standard mcdefault with the karen haircut and the game resembles the recent tomb raider games then I wont bother with it.
melonie I read the back of the og tomb raider n the 1st sentence said millions of people worldwide enjoy and love lara craft
given the trend from games these days particularly from the west  I pray perfect dark would be the exception. we already got generic lara croft for tomb raider. we dont need soccer mom joanna dark.
if you think the modern gaming industry is going to miss an opportunity like this to flex their wokeness with a repackaged female lead  you are deluded. forget sexy deadly femme fatale  thats probably never coming back.
if she turns up with a side shaved head  abandon all hope.
I dont consider walking sims as games. are they entertaining  sure  if thats your thing. are they worth it  well yeah  again  if thats your thing. to me  a game actually requires input beyond moving from one cutscene or dialogue to another. beyond pressing a button to make the dialogue proceed. if you spend more time watching something play out instead of actually moving your character  then its not so much a game. its closer to an interactive movie.
you dont need to remind me  dammit
I find the arguments equating fan service to causing negative effects  perceptions  or outlooks of people in real life to be erroneous.  the idea that designs like old laura croft  samus aran  tifa  kratos  etc endow gamers with unrealistic expectations for people in the real world are misguided.  its the same hackneyed falsehood as the old violence in video games causes violence in real life nonsense that we fought to disprove over 20 years ago against grifters like jack thompson and his ilk.
perfect dark is like aliens or metroid. theres no reason for it to go woke. strong female protagonist kicking ass and taking names why ruin it
joanna deserved better... kojima productions or 2k  titanfall 2
the Bible verses is probably the thing I love most about you. keep up the good work. to paraphrase a famous quote  someone with no enemies is someone who s never stood up for anything in their life.
what in the blue hell is their malfunction
from the moment that I saw in the trailer that the plot was about climate change  I had no interest in this game. sometimes its best to leave well enough alone.
perfect dark was awesome . idk why games just are not good anymore . I just got a ps5 and can not find anything that I want to play . people keep making the same ole trash remake after remake and remaster after remaster . I am thankful for remakes and remasters but put out something original . I was surprised how many 2d games that I saw on the ps5 store . in my opinion if you are not an independent developer you have no business making 2d games not in 2022 . its because of the feminists . if it wasn t for the feminists   sjw s and woke people there would be no problem about keeping the original characters . crash bandicoot is one of the characters that they kept original . him and solid snake . if I remember correctly the music in tomb raider games was pretty good . I do not think it was better than chrono cross but close to it .remember people who hate you hated Jesus first . Jesus told his disciples that if they followed him that people would hate them   persecute them and possibly kill them. when people hate you it just means that you are doing something right . another scripture says that a friend of the world is an enemy of God .
with just those 2 screens Im really not feeling it.  that first one with the boy cut ugh....we all know how this will end we just have to stop rewarding the behavior with our money.
its very true that we are not supposed to be pushovers. remember  Jesus is the guy who fashion to whip and drove moneychangers out of the temple. does that guy sound like a pushover  and thats whose teaching we are supposed to be following.
Im starting to think the people changing these designs has been rejected by hotter girls in their pasts. thats it isn t it
Imean  its crystal dynamics  the last decent games they made was trl and guardian of light. they ve been riding on trl s success for years  and nothing new and good to show for. they couldn t even make the biggest property in the world  avengers  sell.they cant write  they cant make fun gameplay  all they do is miss the point on the properties they work on  and they hopped on the woke train a while back  what is there left for cd  just the fame that they made trl years ago. I have zero expectations for this new pd reboot.
hard to get excited about a reboot of an old game where the original dev team are long gone and its being made by an entirely different studio who will simply slap the title  perfect dark  on whatever this new game turns out to be
yes. its 2022. nothing is safe except the broken.
your thoughts on tomb raider anniversary
boomers  is good  I like it  and Im way too young to be a boomer...ha
whatever happened to core
facts
I got to thinking that may be a reason I lost some viewers on my channel is because I talk about God on it and my faith sometimes which is sad.
I ll just emulate originals
oh ye  perfect dark was a good game.  thats too bad.  I hate soccer moms.also   going full carnivore tomorrow.  it ll be good.boom!!
every girl ive dated loved doaextreme beach vollyball
commenting to feed the algorithm
it is a microsoft title. of course it will be woke.
you look soo human today!!
I swear to fucking God if they do this...
you need to turn dark mode on  my eyes are burning
proud to be a boomer.
wokes butchered female punk style
oh God I hope not
let s hope not
two-dimensional-side-buzzed-purple-highlighted-hair-dont need-no-man-flat-chested-non-binary-lesbian dark confirmed.Im calling it now.
dammit. why the hell do they have to make everything woke ! it fails every single time. smh
clearly the ip should have been left alone.just remaster the original game and port it to pc with online multiplayer  button mapping and a range of settings.
reboot joana will likely have no personality.
looks like youre having to explain the boomber thing quite a few time. might have to change it to  what s up my jihadists  to make it crystal clear.
day 13 of commenting on your videos until g-fuel sponsors me.hot take tho  I really liked angel of darkness.
the first pic of the  new joanna  looks like a side-buzz  flock-of-seagulls do. what the fuck were they thinking
idk cd changed lara  I cant even play the new tr games  played some but no sexy costumes  I dont see the issue with hot female characters. still I definitely miss old lara.
I dont trust crystal d with anything. I dont believe the new tomb raider will be good  like I dont need reboot lara in classic attire   and same with perfect dark. by the way  just like lara  joanna used to be 5 9  and itseems like cd have changed it again. I wonder what s their issue with tall women
ahh... not perfect dark
God I hope not
bro best game to this day is doom 2016 doom eternal
oh yay.guess I ll prepare to not buy this one.
npc design lol
will they go woke  probably  yeah. my issue  gamers still buy it cause they they cannot keep their hype in check. thats a discussion right there.
boomers unite!!!!
free arms ...
Im not religious  but who the heck throws out hate over youreading scripture on your channel. its done at the end of each video  and if they dont like it  then they can stop watching when it comes to thatsegment. I carry on listening because its interesting  and it doesnt harm me to learn of someone else s view of the world.
hImellymac go boom!
the original perfect dark was awesome pd zero was meh and my expectations are that it will very likely suck.  because most modern games almost always go woke and turn to  though I wish the cartoony version was used sadly we ll never get the cartoony version    .
just wait for jo being a lesbian or trans  abbyzilla part 2
offended by the word  boomer  ...  I was born in it  molded by it. I didn t see the woke until I was already a man  by then  it was nothing to me but blinding!

as soon as I saw the woke cut I lost interest
im gen x lol
I do so much boomer shit its not even funny and Im a Goddamn millennial.
want to see a real woman hero  watch the movie run  hide  fight.
umm excuse me! could you please not call us boomers  I dont identify as a boomer. reeee
sick of the ruby rose haircut. joanna dark has short hair but it was a different look to modern female game character.
in the pic with the car the looks like cris redfield
keep using the term boomers.lol
people are fast asleep anyway  in a zombie like trance to worry about actual important things. you speak about things that dont make sense but to many it does and thats going to create a false society.
I think they should make joanna dark a strooooong black woman.
ok boomer xddd
now that those people mention it. xbox exclusives have been hot garbo in  the past few years outside of forza.
oh lard
in my opinion  perfect dark was better than goldeneye. I didn t like perfect dark zero  I have very low expectations for this reboot. the Bible says be strong  so eat meat.
joanna going full on butch.
what s with you tube male gamers pretending they only play dead or alive for the game play  do they think that will get them dates with woke girls. its okay to be honest.
crystal dynamics making stealth shooter  ... perfect dark  ... its gonna suck so bad      I can already see joanna being whinny and woke and having all these weird ugly outfits  very floaty physics  if any  and stealth is just waiting on a corner until the pew pew starts.
that looks suspiciosly like the sjw side shave hair.
Imuch prefer a cute woman who s a Goddess with no clothes  but dresses very modestly  almost boring but incredibly cute.not a fan of the out and out type. too much  no imagination.
d
perfect dark will be a boring game
I hated life is strange  it was one of my first reviews  still crappy mic  and I was very turned off by it.
bullets are not my favorite!
damn youre a debbie downer aren t ya lol.   I ll hold any judgment until the game is out. spencer has said in the past they d like to have a uncharted like franchise. so maybe this joanna dark will be the laura croft 2.0.
crystal dynamics is involved yeah mopey depressing games no thank you I pass.
yeah  battletoads sucked. but sea of thieves is still pretty fun.  o
they keep destroying beautiful women.remember the beautiful villain in terminator 3 then they followed it with thatshort haired man looking thing
gee... melonie s minions... mm  3825... unskippable cutscenes suck... as for perfect dark  thanks for reminding me Im old... I hated pd zero...hope they leave her as she was in pd
uncharted inspiration is everything wrong with modern tomb raider
@melonie mac go boom maybe for you but I actually enjoyed the new series. and the uncharted is extremely well put game.
@komanga  and you could use some uncharted like atmosphere into the game Im sure. Im a player with a opinion not a armchair game developer.
another character ruined.
Im saddened to see youre adding to the culture war for the sake of it  please dont become the quartering  dont gaze long into the abyssal so to speak.  I still think youre tomb raider points are valid but this is nitpicking.
yup  look at the silhouette they ve shown of the new joanna dark. what did I tell you  they re going with thatstupid looking lobotomy hair cut. smh. why do wokies think that haircut looks good
I disagree  classic tr controls terribly. her movement speed  her tank turning  her delayed jumping  rolling and shooting  her slow ass pickup speed never grew on me and I cant stand it or games with the same movement style  so if that means I dont like classic tr then I dont like classic tr. also  just in case someone thinks its because I didn t play old games  I am 42 and have been gaming since 1983 as I was born in 1980.
keep using boomers. people who get offended by a simple word weren t your target audience to begin with.
wait its ok for you to have an opinion on something but if I dont like elden ring Im a hater  people are allowed to have different opinions and views on stuff without being called a hater.
who said you weren t allowed to dislike elden ring  not me
