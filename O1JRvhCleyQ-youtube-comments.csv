when all these female lead bait and switch series fail. Im afraid executives of these studios are going to learn the wrong lesson. they ll assume we dont want female lead series instead of the real message  make them interesting and keep your hacktivism out of it.
not shaping up to be very good.  has become disney  and marvel s catchphrase as of lately.
thats very disappointing news that the she hulk show is looking bad.    I love she hulk in the comics at least back in the day  I haven t read anything new with her   she s hilarious! also thagomizer had a good mark twain quote. another good one that is applicable to what you said about not trusting the media is  believe none of what you hear and only half of what you see.  edit  nevermind  that was edgar allen poe. embarrassed still a good quote tho.
the moment melonie got hyped for moon knight   is that a tomb !
I hate dismissing things out of hand  which seems to be the trend of how a lot of people are responding given the overall move of these companies to be more woke. I prefer to give the benefit of the doubt at least until the movie show actually comes out and we have reactions to what is rather than what might be. I appreciate you keeping a level head and reacting to things in this manner.
if its true than she-hulk could turn out like iron fist an absolute dumpster fire show. and youre right I think they should start branching out and do solo stories. there are sooo many good stories to be told that dont need to be roped into the over arching story.
long in the tooth means  getting old.  the term alludes to horses gums receding with age  making their teeth look longer.
I hope she-hulk turns out to be good. I grew up loving the character. I just want a series thatshows her cracking skulls in the courtroom and in the streets.
imagine how cool it would be to actually watch him get really old playing the part
at this point Im rooting for a deadpool kill s the mcu movie
this is what marvel has been doing lately. instead of establishing and working on unique female characters  they are using females to replace established male roles. so not only are they getting rid of the men  they aren t allowing women to stand on their own without propping them on a male s original role.
I just really wanted to say thank you for officially helping me finish tomb raider underwold. they where times I almost gave up because pc controls  but I pushed on. there s no shame in admitting that I had help. both your 1 and 2nd channel are a huge blessing  keep up the good work to be honest.
on the twitter thumbnail  of the article youread  she-hulk is like  oh please  your petty woke trash is the problem  not me.  giving the brown haired woman a smug and taunting smile. love that picture
if they stuck to the comics  she-hulk has a lot of potential to be a sassy comic relief character that can still beat anyone up... in other words  the perfect woman. but if the title is being marketed as  she hulk   you can be sure they ll inject some identity politics trash into itthe answers in genesis youtube channel has a good video on disney s current  woke  trajectory. in it they point out how ultimately everyone is evangelistic  desiring to get others to agree with them. disney has chosen to tune into the safest  most inclusive worldview  at best because  inclusivity  implies  more people  which means  more money   and at worst because some dark elite cabal is using them as a propaganda machine. answers in genesis doesnt add that last part  thats just what it looks like to me lolIm just glad melonie is using her channel to evangelize people to the truth in God s word. thats really the best way to fight back against the collective brainwash  hang on tight to the fundamental truth of God and unite with others who do the same. thank you for all that you do melonie
if they bring in the multiverse correctly it could rock with all kinds of new story lines based on what s in the comic. but they need to follow a little closer to the comics.
I heard somebody call the mcu the m-she-u  and only now do I get it   as a woman who loved her dad and brothers  I wish they would stop replacing strong male characters with women!btw  that was a great verse of the day!  it is so comforting that God has got our backs.  thanks for sharing!
tatiana played multiple characters in the show orphan black. she was really really good in it. I haven t seen her in anything else tho. rebooting the avengers in 10 years sounds like a terrible idea to me.
on one hand  Im cool with another big build up multI character avengers endgame kind of thing  but you do make a really good point where they dont seem as focused on moving standing alone. Im still looking forward to the next dr strange movie though
so I recently got into berserk because  I guess  twitter got pissed and I saw itsagundam s video about the rage   and I had to find out what upset the wokies so much. I actually ended up really liking it and I guess it heavily inspired things in elden ring  hence twitter s novel discovery of a manga from the late 80 s-early 90 s . was wondering if you knew about it your opinion on it.
the iron man and hulk movies havingend creditscenes that connected all the movies was amazing and so was avengers but disney clearly lost creative direction and dont know what they are doing anymore
dont worry  they dont care what you want anyway so there wont be any lessons learned
14 out of 18 tv series and movies are now with a female lead  or with a storyline that primarily centers on the female sidekick. I dont know about you  but as a male I could generally use a lot less just fine.
the same lesson of ghostbusters 2016
nah they ll keep making them just more insufferable.
@erik demann  Im fine with more  the problem is that these female characters aren t interesting and dont do anything compelling as a man myself I definitely think  we need more male characters that are allowed to be masculine and are able to save women from time to time  there s a huge imbalance in these movies nowadays where the men are all pathetic  stupid and useless and its just gross.
@erik demann  most of them aren t even good characters  and are just a self insert caricature I dont care if they make more or less as long as they aren t trashing the male ones  I swear moon knight was the last strawthats what made me lose all interest in the mcu  dude couldn t even be the protagonist.
as a wise man once said   everything woke turns to s disney  superhero shows t.
not shaping up to be very good.    steaming pile of hot garbage.
dont forget about star wars too.
I wouldnt make anny pre-conseived notions untill you actualy see it thatsome think its not looking to good says nothing we dont know who said that maybe some sjw working at marvel maybe it is bad I dont know il first have to see it before Imake a judgement shaping youre perception on a second party isnt  always good first hand withness is best.
@marc van der meyden  I agree with you that one should save final judgement for when the show is actually out  but still  I d much rather be hearing a lot of positive things about a show I care about then a lot of  negative things.
@marc van der meyden  well...
turns out people were right.
marvel has pigeon-holed themselves into huge story arcs while dc shocks people when there are any ties at all between their movies.
she-hulk could be a great action comedy character  but sadly there s such a high probability that they re going to sully it up with identity politics trash  especially if its being marketed as  she hulk
I swear if they ruin she hulk and turn her into some bland social justice pariah I am gonna be fucking done with marvel
@kallo s crypt  ditto. I love she-hulk and Im wary.
@kallo s crypt  if they dont use big mike and his swinging she stick then is it really she hulk
never heard of someone loving she hulk
@kallo s crypt  have they been doing this  like in the actual content    or do you mean the actors creators being political
@jeff fettes  take your pick and let me know what you come up with
@kallo s crypt  I watch most of the mcu stuff and I haven t noticed anything there but good vibes. I know some of the actors and artists have strong opinions but  so what  I only judge what s on the screen. hope she-hulk is good!
@kallo s crypt  they did.
we wont even get the walking away music.
them stick to the comics    good joke. remember is all about muh agenda.
she hulk isn t replacing hulk. she s a beloved character that has been around for years
@beyond animation  I wasn t speaking specifically about she-hulk  but in general the mcu seems to be  retiring  the male old guard  hulk  iron man  hawkeye  etc  with female counterparts  she-hulk  iron heart  girl hawkeye .
guns made a darned good video on thatsubject  with his love of the story truly shining through.
its a bit of a shame  tatiana maslany is a great actor. if you ve never heard of it  you should check out orphan black. she plays like 5-7 characters in thatshow and did a great job with all of them. hope she-hulk turns out to be better than people think  for her sake.
I ll remain skeptical for the final show  but...well  at least there s moon knight.
tatiana maslany is a freaking incredible actress  orphan black was just her pulling off acting wizardry for five seasons  so if anybody can save this  she can. but I refuse to give disney a cent of my money so it wont affect me either way.
yet another reason Im glad I slipped away from american comics at a fairly early age and fell right into manga. haven t looked back since! hollywood and the american comic and cartoon industries have fallen on sad and pathetic times  or maybe it was always that way and its just become more obvious.meanwhile  I cant wait for the next season of rising of the shield hero and the next sao  progressive film. gonna be a blast!
Imean  Im not automatically opposed to a she hulk series being like a sit-com format  because the comics were pretty tongue in cheek anyway   but Ive never really seen many us sit-coms in my life that I particularly liked all that much.
one day  I ll read the older she-hulk comics and tie-ins  and see what she s all about.  as I hear it  she s a decent character.
it wouldn t surprise me if they were trying to get rid of the hulk. they kind of wrote themselves into a corner with him anyway in endgame.
well the hulk is owned by universal studios which Im sure disney could cut a deal with if they wanted to make a solo hulk movie.  like they did with spiderman . but I dont think universal owns she-hulk  correct me if Im wrong . so if they wanted to do more with  hulk  they could use she-hulk without having to share any profit. also  even in all the movies hawkeye has been in  he constantly talks about wanting to retire to be with his family. so it wasn t too far fetched for him to pass on the torch to anyone.
I think the slap was a bit of both not entirely fake or stage but not just a random occurrence. will smith did laughed at the joke and then he reacted with slap  I haven t been bothered to find a whole video because Im tired of it already and I dont want give the oscars any more attention.melonie I thought you were going to put the Bible reference in the description of the videos. sometimes Im watching on my switch  or a number of other devices  its just something that would be nice instead of turning up the res on the video. I watch on 360p or 480p mostly so that Im not getting lag during online gaming or so that everyone else does suffer as much bandwidth loss from me watching 1080p 720p videos  I even go as far as to download then watch instead of streaming the movies tv shows if I can. I do try to look up the Bible verses later even after watching video of others.I know that it would an extra step but it would be nice to have there. Ive sure been enjoying the content and the verses  just please maybe start doing this.
you have such great lighting in your videos it makes you glow
feels like coletrain gets frustrated when you start the show without. how can you start without the star
its always fun to see the real star of the show cole train
I d be down to see banner leave the avengers because he becomes savage hulk again. kind of  the guy on the run  style. I like some darkness in my banner...he s too cheerful right now.
good video melody  I just watch moon knight I love how it went so good with the hole split personally  I thought it was cool how they did that
the mainstream entertainment industry always has to overdo everything  just because 1 marvel movie did good one time at one point doesnt mean they will all be instantly a smash hit. I dont even do movies or direct  I am the ceo of nothing and yet even I know that much.
no marvel reboots  please  just give marvel the boot!
the greatest drawback with the more recent women in mcu  is they dont struggle against odds.  they dont get beat  they dont overcome adversity.  its  Im powerful woman  I win   and the end.  very little character building.  tho the new black widow s actress is fantastic and I cant get enough of.
cat automatically makes any video a 10 10!
the new trailer today looks like pure girl power cheese.
tatiana maslaney is awesome  she was fantastic in orphan black.   that makes me want to like she-hulk.  but disney has been a bad company and writing for marvel tv series has been garbage.  so sadly I have no hope  will have to wait and see.
just the john byrne era
now that you mention itshe does.  though clearly she has special lighting to light her that doesnt match the white balance of her room lighting   she looks great  but the orange warm look of her room in the background looks off distracting.
I want she hulk to be good. Im just concerned about which she hulk they go with  if she s the third wall breaking   before deadpool  version cool. if she s the sexy confident lawyer  cool. if she s the latest monstrosity of wokeness cancer in comics then hard pass.
I dont like to pre-judge. I ll wait until its released and decide after Ive seen it. or at least until Ive seen a few reviews from people who have.
all good things come to an end.
as they get older...tony stark  successfully completing a mission  breaks a hip while getting out of the suit.  still wants to chase the young things  but needs a rascal scooter  to actually catch them.  adds portable oxygen tank to the suit  and a larger catheter tank.
Im surprised they are not calling her they-hulk
amongst all those shows and they see she-hulk as a problem or problematic...honestly would give this a shot  just simply because they disapprove of it.
8 24 my cat likes to come hang out with me when hears me talking too. I live by myself so it normally pretty quiet  but if I get on the phone or discord my cat shows up in just a minute or two.
getting long in the tooth   is a reference to getting older.  in this case it means the actor  ruffalo  is getting too old continue the role.
I think they can stop making superhero movies now. they can move on  and if they make superhero content of any kind  it can be something entirely different from the mcu. make their own stuff. they have the funding and people for it. but as they have said  its a numbers game. they will never stop trying to milk the genre until it goes sour and destroys itself. hopefully right along with disney. a man can dream.
fake melonie mac tweet  there is black-on-black-crime even on the oscars
long in the tooth  is an equestrian idiom. it comes from the fact that when horses get old  their gum begins recede.
melonie mac totally based and one of the g o a t  youtubers as far as I am concerned
long in the tooth   means old or getting old
Im in a state of disillusionment with nerd culture. whether its video games being released broken or woke  or constantly seeing woke elements in movies. every so often  you get something decent. but its extremely rare.
Imean I wasnt expecting much else from marvel and disney .... im actually worried about obI wan..... God help them if they screw up obI lol
the melonie mac go boom is always the best of all. also a another boom of fail on the marvel phase meh 4 . wow she-hulk is failing  not much a surprise tbh lol
her eyes are intoxicating   damn I just simped again today
all im afraid of right now is my 200lb dumbbell set is not coming or the price will be 2x what I want to pay.
they already ruined the hulk on  end game  by not only not giving him a rematch with thanos but also leaving him completely out of the movie
I dont know if I d care to see a stand-alone hulk movie anymore so a she-hulk isn t even on my table of consideration.
likewise  this is also where the idiom about looking a gift horse in the mouth comes from.
if your chris rock you need to be perfect and know everyone that would be seriously offended
they have so many heroes to bring to the fore front  iron man  hawk eye  black widow and even thor weren t that popular before the movies. bring squirrel girl to the front.
mark ruffalo   long in the tooth  short in the brain  but a good dopey hulk.
I think the ultimate fallacy of attempting to make female characters who were originally made for a specific audience  ie- young males  and attempting to adapt them to have some kind of mass appeal  is that you ultimately remove aspects of the character that made them popular  with their original demographic  to begin with.  this doesnt go just for characters  but entire franchises as well  see star wars .  the thing is that these properties already tended to have broader appeal even if they weren t necessarily made for those demographics  because they weren t being made to cater.  at least in the sense that things are now.  back in the day  Imean  sure star wars marvel dc all of these things were mainly being directed at young males  but there was never an objective or an ulterior motive in producing this content.  pure creativity  thats all it was.  they could be enjoyed for what they were by the people who wanted to enjoy them.  there was none of this catering to this demographic or that to score brownie points with them and be declared  woke  by the masses  as if thats anything more than a badge of creative bankruptcy these days.  creativity will always fail when the message becomes more important than the content.
if the people making it think that its problematic maybe thats a good thing  considering how things have been going.
I hope they add trophy support to the ps1  ps2  and psp games for ps plus premium.  imanI being able to platinum trophy the ps1 tomb raider games and the original crash and spyro games
I really hope this is just talk. this is the show Ive been looking forward to the most  besides hawkeye
hey melonie I just want to say that I think thatshe-hulk movie will be okay type movie to see if they add a man-hulk to join with she-hulk in the movie bc I think that it will be better and great movie if they had two hulks fighting the enemies to save the earth in the movie  ok melonie. anyway I just want to say bout this topic of the new upcoming movie of she-hulk  ok melonie. anyway have a wonderful   great evening at home with your pets and have good night too.
you said it again! I was legit disappointed the other day when you didn t say  boomers  in your intro
coltrane the surprise guest of the show that dgaf.  I love cats.  burmese and savannah all the way.
tatiana maslany was not a good choice for she-hulk.  especially since they decided to turn it into a 1 2 hour comedy instead of a drama.  phase 4 is already officially a shitshow and she-hulk is merely one more dropping on the pile.  if I were going to cast she-hulk for a competently run show  the two names that come to mind are gina carano  who the mouse gifted to the daily wire  or ronda rousey  although I have not seen her act .  and if they plan on going the route they did in the comics with that character  it will only get worse as time goes on.  if disney were smart  and they dont seem to be lately  they would have called it over for the mcu after endgame.  then  like you said  wait 10 years and start over either will the same characters or a mix of new and familiar characters with new stories.
ive learned in my life you watch something then watch reviews
its getting to the point where superhero movies are on their way to becoming the next western where people are gonna get burned out. in fact people checked out after endgame.  at this point I would take superhero movie like invincible or hell any original superhero movie  thats not the big two   marvel and dead company dc .
every time mark ruffalo talks itsounds like he s eating pieces of his own brain.
a few reasons for this may be 1.  marvel is not hiring talented writers and or showrunners.2.  the  message  and  representation  are a higher priority than quality.3.  the people that marvel are hiring do not know and or respect the source material.  for example  the showrunner of wandavision knew nothing about comics.  not even how to read them.p.s. the slap at the academy awards was staged  in order to get buzz.
you shouldn t watch them  but if youreally think  the slap  was fake  watch videos of will and jada together  will is a man that is at the end of his rope and if he doesnt leave her  like yesterday  I fear he may very well end up killing himself.  I like tatiana maslany  it would really suck if the she-hulk series is a bust  but then again  I dont really expect anything else from disney s mcu at this point.
by numerous sources they mean people who make clickbait videos day in  day out. even though its just rumors without any actual proof of anything  they put out videos all the time just get their daily views.
this verse of the day is   pod made a song with matisyahu from it  its called strength of my life. you should check it put its one of my favorites.
that image of the she hulk looks ok. I atleast like thatshe has muscles that would be ideal for her. now this be a fake photo  but I am interested in watching this... butt... I fear that they will give her the wrong attitude and all  seperating her from what makes her awesome  but we ll see!
I ll say it like this  mel   the problem with present marvel film methodology is making a chain too long.  even if these films were good  popcorn forgetters    we get bored.  Imean  how many times can you eat the same thing in a row  and expect it to be good.    only   we are getting even more watered down crap  and in lesser quantity size.  dont be surprised if folks just tune out entirely with anything marvel.  thatshould scare feige.  same with disney  which  frankly  I dont know anyone who actively subscribes to their trash.
you ve contradicted yourself at several points in this comment..
@scott mcmahon  I acknowledge the fact that the above mentioned properties were aimed at a particular demographic  the point was that there was no objective reason for this beyond thats who the typical audience for the medium was traditionally.  ie - it was targeted at a demographic without political reasons for doing so.  its not the same thing as the way demographics are targeted today which often is for a political reason.  anything else   if so  be specific if youre going to reply  dont just offer a broad statement without backing it up.
haha I forgot that one day
tatiana maslany was not a good choice for she-hulk.  umm.....and why do you say that
@dragondez07  she-hulk is a big woman.  tatiana maslany is barely over 5 feet tall.  given what I saw on the few episodes of orphan black I watched  she is also rather slim.  so  unless they are going to motion-capture her acting and make she-hulk cgI like they did ruffalo in endgame or they put her on a diet of red meat  steroids  and hgh for a year before start of production  she is badly miscast.  they needed someone with height  maybe not the six and a half feet of she-hulk in the comics  but tall  and an athletic physique that could be sculpted by workouts before production started.  maslany has neither.
I wish I could be enthused by she-hulk. from all I heard from the nerd-o-sphere  she was a great character. but dont feel like it is just women getting disappointed... the male characters are all getting screwed too. disney has just become toxic. they need a house cleaning in a serious way.even spiderman no way home was not a great movie. but after getting kicked in the b@!!  by disney the last few years now  youremember like a husband or wife... its more important you feel loved  than have them be perfect. and spider-man managed to leave fans feeling love  which is above all things.
Im very envious of your cat lol!  what a show-stealer!
what I find interesting is how us video media is now being seen as just as bad as us music media has been.rather than out out quality stuff  the corporate bigwigs dont care about quality  they care about quantity  never realizing that if something has actual value  people will keep it. to be honest  its why I dont really watch movies or tv shows anymore  and the music I listen to is almost exclusively non-american. do I want sci-fImusic  unleash the archers and arjen lucassen it is. do I want bangers with deep and awesome messages  bloodywood from india. do I want to hear something that makes me think  nightwish from finland. do I want to learn about history  sabaton from sweden. do I want to hear stories  ignea  from ukraine. do I want to hear dwarves from middle earth rocking out  wind rose. the list goes on and on.only now  the visual media has become just as bland as the us music media has been.the only video series Ive been excited for in the last five years has been the legend of vox machina  an animated series based on campaign 1 of critical role -- which is creator-driven because of an  11 million kickstarter campaign.
she hulk supposedly looks like trash   I dont think anyone who is not  lunatic  woke  is not surprised in the least.
the problem with disney is that they are focusing more on  diversity  than source material. there is so much good content if they would just respect the source material.
people did not take issue with female characters in the early mcu movies because they were awesome characters that happened to be women. my issues arise when the focus shifts from being about the character and more about the fact the character is female. itspoils the milk for me. they need to stop doing this. just create a character who is awesome on her own and let her character speak for herself.
she hulk is my favourite marvel character so I hope they dont f it up. tatiana is a great actress
melonie  if you want an honest opinion on a recent mcu disney  series  I think hawkeye is an underrated show that actually doesnt lean too heavily on far left  woke messaging. kate bishop is a likable character more so than she is in the comics. she s not a mary sue. clint actually gets some good closure by the end. its a good series. one of the better shows to come out of the mcu.
they cant do planet hulk a second time.  they skimmed it when they did thor  ragnarok.  thor showed up on the  planet hulk  planet  hulk just didn t come back with a warband after and almost destroy the earth.
I personally dont care for mcu myself. Im just kind of bored by them. to be honest I dont like near anything hollywood has made for the better part of a decade. I was never a marvel and dc comics fan beyond x-men and batman  I always got aliens  predator and aliens vs predator comics. dark horse also did a continuation of john carpenter s the thing that was good  but that film just like john carpenter s halloween 1978 are best as stand alone 90 min movies  perfect endings for what its trying to do.
here s a great Bible verse.  they will fight against you  but they will not prevail over you  for I am with you always to protect and deliver you  says the Lord  jeremiah 1 19
hImelonie what s your thoughts on sleeping dogs and max payne series and do you think the oscars was staged it could ve been
you can always turn thor into an hitlerian God and have all the strong wamen kick his ass in a grand finale for the  old world .
turns out the leaks were true all of them.
remember when comics were good and didn t pander to wokesters who didn t even read them  pepperidge farms remembers....
moon knight is the only show that Im genuinely looking forward to. everything else looks like trash.
Im shocked! shocked  I tell you!
disney tries so hard to be diverse  that they fail to see the real point of being diverse... moon knight is the only thing I see worth watching...
long in the tooth means old. referring to being able to see the age of a horse by the length of its teeth
hold the line. it may seem hopeless with women overtaking men s roles in the marvel dc world  but soon enough trans women will bring men back into those roles.
@mr. marc g.  technically I agree with you about source material. but their early mcu stuff was pretty decent. winter soldier was fantastic  infinity war was pretty damn amazing. they showed some respect  not a lot  but far more than other people. zack snyder for example. his justice league was awful.
@jeremiah  true. I did think the extended version of jl was a lot better than the shorter original release. still so far from what it could have been though.
@mr. marc g.  I disagree. I think snyder was given an opportunity to play with 80 million dollars and instead of telling a great story  he did his damndest to separate  his version  from joss whedon. in reality  snyder was responsible for all the cringe. the bad jokes  the poor storytelling  the pathetic special effects. that was all snyder. I would highly recommend you look up a youtube named mauler. his jl critique is excellent  and in it he breaks down how it was snyder all along.
@jeremiah  jl certainly isn t the hill I wanna die on  lolz. Imay look that up. thanks.
they absolutely butchered kingpin  just unforgivable
@serious mike  butchered  no. Imean I would say they made him even stronger than in the netflix shows  considering he cantoss kate around with ease and rip off car doors. but Im wondering if they ll actually bring him back or if they legit killed him off.
dc s strongest movies of the last ten years are the ones thatstood on their own such as wonder woman  joker  shazam.  their forced  cinematic universe  films are generally seen as the weakest... like the first suicide squad   batman v superman.  the mcu was so good in the 1st two  phases  because they took the time to stand-alone films first to build a foundation.  now  marvel are the ones pushing out forced titles with poor foundation in an effort to make everything  fit.   but everything doesnt need to  fit.   they ve become the victims of their own success.  they ll never duplicate endgame  or the 1st avengers.    those moments were special.  and the erection they have for shoe-horning woke messaging in everything is a majoras well
I ll watch it if I get a muscle mommy with gratuitous flex shots. if not  hard pass.
mcu ended with endgame imo. now you are just looking for the diamond in the rough like  no way home
sup boom.   I was hoping for jessica jones cameo in a dark plot for she hulk.
who is the super villian  hope it be observing man with titania or the leader in the mcu tv series
dont worry  journos will write that  its not supposed to be good .
it would be good if gina carano were cast as jennifer.
there are green women in star trek too
they re trying to eliminate all the original characters  jane foster thor will take over same with she hulk
I hear katlyn jenner is going to be the stunt double.
I been looking forward to she hulk for a long time onscreen outside of cartoons so they better not fuck this up she is one of my favorite marvel heroes.the only real problem they ever had with these things is bd identity politics and you can say the people working on itsay its meh but wel who is working on it  if its  bunch of sjw thatsay its meh then it might actualy be good for us normal people.and yes the slap feels more like  publicity stunt how come wil went from laughing to walking on stage to slap him that was the weirdest follow up ever.and movies is often the goverment talking truth through hollywood like with the hunger games and insurgent and stuf truth shown in plane sight disguised as  o its just  a movie  .its actualy a law of God that they have to show us in some way what there doing they have to tell us so what better way then through a platform most think is just fiction they have shown us most are just to gullible to see truth when its presented in  a diffirent way.if they dont show us before they do it then they get bad karma only when they show us  they are mostly absolved of the karma because most saw and did nothing.the Bible verse is nice only thing I disgree with is the fear God doesnt want you to fear  God is family and there is no need to fear family.
live action fiona shrek
thats 1issue I have with religion  itsays we all are trash and its same as living with vurbly abusive spouse
looks like a all female avengers team is coming
imagine my shock
since I ditched twitter  Ive migrated my trolling operations to insta.
long in the tooth  means old  lol.
its the shewoke.
so she hulk not smash
long in the tooth means old. from back when you would look in a horses mouth to determine its age before buying it.
eh endgame was all hype  .. infinity war now thats where its at.  .. beside them ruining hulk infinity war was thee movie
disney has been ruining marvel and the idea of handing off the mantle of iron man  cap  etc. to new people is stupid.  if they need to retire the older actors fine  but then bring in new characters.  I dont know anything really about she-hulk but I think someone  nerdrotic   said the character has been around awhile and is very different than hulk.  so maybe that is a good choice.  dont know.
its so lame how they de-sexyfied her by not keeping her shoulders bare. the mcu is so afraid of sexyness
marvel disney  projects are straight fades
so basicly new mcu and avengers and such  will be all female  nice one m-she-u!
considering how bad most of the marvel shows have been  I have 0 expecations
13 34 her flexing!
we already know they are getting rid of all the male super heroes.
melonie  its john ro  kha  its a hard c. xd
please.....let my she-hulk be good or at least tolerable! ruffalo is already a stain on my boy the hulk!sorry  like lara croft for you melonie  the hulk is important to me. also gargoyles. no one mess with those.
we heard the same stuff about the batman constantly. probably just want free publicity. I ll wait and hold judgment
they are going to kill off thor and replace him with she-thor... with a lightsaber hammer
the mcu ended with endgame.
they-hulk
its hollywood everything has to have a stupid message   _   _   what happened to our lovely earth
she s not as powerful as the incredible hulk
she hulk-- isn t that big mike obama

I think the actress doesnt show well on the big screen.  for post show stuff in films.
only if your chris your not perfect its okay
what  planet hulk  storyline   the one they already fucked up in  thor ragnorok  !!
maslsny   she was great in orphan black.  personally I dont care about her personal life as long as she can make good art.  tom cruise is obviously a nutter  but damn is he good at acting.
how are they going to do a world war hulk with such a depowered hulk and they already fucked up planet hulk  you know the beginning of world war hulk  in ragnarok
mark ruffalo has been pretty woke lately  so Im fine with kicking his ass out.
have you seen it

long in the tooth  -- an old way of talking about people looking old. gums retract somewhat as people get older  sometimes.
I have no interest in she hulk although I ll watch it to see what happens to my boy the hulk. its going to end with a bang for him. no more professor hulk come back angry!
fnt sent me.........kitty!
shocker!
strong independent green female
bro there replacing hulk with she hulk I dont really care because in comics she is good but if mcu makes here woke and crappy like they do a lot of stuff. plus they just sell the rights to hulk so he can get his own movies so much wasted potential.
welp anime it is
I just dont see a benefit in the will smith slap being fake  thats just me. this is not a good look at all for the oscars  only thing people talked about is the awful jokes from the 3 hosts for the price of 1 man and the slap. I think will is collapsing over his wife and her escapades and a midlife chrisis.
just watched ep 2 of halo... did anyone like it
naw rdj will never be not good as tony  he is ironman
use to love the old she hulk comics this show just looks cheesy
hulk was based on frankenstein. what about a female frankenstein
cool
she hulk pronouns are she them
they can keep the m-she-u crap.....  maybe thor s movie will be decent at least. and of course dr strange multiverse
mcu movies shows always range from bad to mediocre so this is not surprising.
thats where Ive been lately.
it always goes back to anime.
greetings boomers from tonto basin arizona kemosabe!  I am late to the party as usual. live long and perspire.
at this point  everything disney touches is dead to me. they re screwing everything over  and Im not going to support it.
good riddance to mark ruffalo.  he just isn t believable as bruce banner.  I never found the character of she-hulk to be very engaging in the comics so am skeptical it will work well on screen.  she just never had to jekyll-hyde pathos that lay behind bruce banner s struggle with being the hulk and itseems current marvel just doesnt understand that.
I haven t liked a single show they have put out. they ruined hulk  and now they will ruin she-hulk. also  race swapped titania because she s a red head
not a fan of the actress they picked for she hulk. and about the slap being fake. why  why would chris risk trauma  embarrassment  his image and looked down and bullied as a 50 something year old man  just for the oscars ratings  doesnt make sense. I hope none of yall get slapped in front of a billion people and have to live thru that every day for weeks.
omg those are some bad-fuckin-ass tattoos.
heman boyfriend may work
1 like and comment for the kitty
trash can only produce trash.
I see a kitty in your floor!!  pet it!!
Im not sure if that whole thing was staged or real but its horrible optics for the entire black community.  unfortunately  it also shows that the first way to respond to a joke is with violence. this is not what we should be doing or promoting.
heard morbius is really bad might be winning a razzie award for worst superhero movie of all time. shame as I was looking forward to that.please moonknight be good hearing mixed reports. marvel slipping a bit lately.
she-bulk
why isn t she hulk a black women !      unbelievable..
why would anyone actually want to watch this
marvel movies have no life to them anymore   they re just pumping out movies so much nobody cares anymore .
modern ripoff disney never fail to let their old time fans down with their amounting levels of unimaginative n unwanted diversity corporate nobshining garbage.
another msheu disaster
so glad I dipped out after endgame. everything after no way home looks like total shit
Ive lost track  is this a movie or tv   maybe it wont suck if it is a movie.  all their tv is garbage but still some hope for movies.
ruffalo was a weak beta hulk  he didnt get hit with gamma radiation he got hit with beta radiation
melonie please stop stop doing this. why are you always wanting marvel to fail on their movie   disney   projects. they want to deliver the best quality entertainment for everyone to enjoy.
omg!!! this show idea is sooo offensive!!! how do they know its a  she  hulk    because a  women female  plays it    since when did disney become experts in biology
youre just jealous
ratios
marvel going to have a lot of flops soon just like eternals doctor strange will probably be okay and probably guardians but the rest are headed to flop city  there bringing all the characters that nobody asked for knows or cares about  no fantastic four no x-men no punisher and no daredevil smh.
hello and to you have all the righteous blessings. could u please direct I to that marvelous Bible verse  pls thx!
first
she hulk was garbage to beginning to end  nothing interesting or compelling because  it was written by a bunch of deranged feminists so of course its gonna be bad lol.
woke trash is boring and identity politics driven dumpster fire  . what happened to good story telling   strong characters and fun shows of the past
who cares  marvel sucks  im glad to see marvel piss it all down the drain. everything should have stopped at endgame
for me I think it was the end of the trailer you see I thought she was carrying him and save him from getting his ass whooped by some thugs which would have made more sense but now its much worse than that woke at his finest and said she doesnt want to be a superhero or oh no this is f    so I dont trust him I haven t look what they did to hawkeye and everybody in the damn doctor strange 2
