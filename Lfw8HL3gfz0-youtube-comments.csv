Im glad amazon wont be ruining conan. there s no way conan could be done right in this era of hollywood.
so conan s story is about wandering due to rejection and being treated like nothing more than mindless savage and amazon rejecting the idea of a conan show because they view him as  toxic masculinity . I wonder if amazon sees the irony in this.
during the covid lockdowns  I actually read the entire series of conan tales.  there s one or two really strong female characters in there  the most notable being b lit  a swashbuckling  ruthless queen of pirates who takes conan as her partner.  you could do an entire movie of conan as a pirate with b lit alongside him--the people rejecting conan clearly have only seen the schwarzenegger films and not read the actual short stories that howard wrote.
Ive never been so excited to hear something I really wanted get cancelled.
its just bizarre that we re at the point where we are grateful when they re not making a show movie based on a property or character we like.
yeah  I remember the days when I looked forward to a film adaptation to a book or story I loved.....now  after having my  expectations subverted  by the film industry so many times  my expectations have shifted to such a degree that whenever I hear about an upcoming movie or series  five words immediately enter my mind  I bet thats gonna suck!  and if they ever decide to do a 180 and abandonthis crap  one thing they re going to find out is that its a lot easier to burn bridges than it is to build them! they ve gone out of their way to alienate and degrade their fandoms and paying customers  and people are hard pressed to forget stuff like that.....like sisyphus from greek mythology  they re going to find that boulder pretty difficult to roll up the hill! they re going to find reaching out to fans  apologizing and getting them to return will be a constant uphill battle  as their efforts are rejected  putting them back where they started. oh well......they brought it on themselves!
one of my favorite conan moments from the books is when he came upon a village where a group of raiders were attacking the defenseless people. without thinking  conan locks swords with the raider s leader. he shouted   what kind of men are you  who make war with women and children  how fare you against one who can fight back   he then proceeded in defending the village the way he did best.if that is  toxic masculinity   then Im fine with it.edit...this from a dark horse comics adaptation of the frost giant s daughter story. its in the second volume of the trades. I looked it up  its been awhile since I had read it  and realized that I didn t get the quote quote right. its actually this   so  you make war on women and children and call it a blood feud  do you  then come you forward  northmen. for in my land  men settle their quarrels like men!
hail melanie. I too am glad that amazon wont be ruining conan. instead  netflix will ruin it instead.  Im a  toxic male  in my 50s and have been a fan of robert e. howard  creator of conan  since I was a kid. amazon s attempt to become an entertainment platform has become a horrendous joke. but...netflix gave us  cuties . I dont think anything hollywood  including the streaming services  will ever change.
youre absolutely right.  origin stories  are code for   we re going to write a version of the character that has nothing except the name in common with the character we baited you into your seat to watch. yep. we suckered you in here with the franchise marquee  but thats not what youre gonna get  suckerrr! so done with this kind of shit. I hope we all are  and maybe -- just maybe -- they re figuring that out.maybe thats the real reason they canceled their plans to do this to conan  because maybe they realized that it would be a waste of their money to do this because nobody would watch it.
I have no idea how anyone could make a better or even comperable version of conan than the 1982 movie staring arnold schwarzenegger. that movie is truly a masterpiece.
there s a lot of good  progressive stuff in conan stories that I think pushed culture in the right direction.  in several cases  when there s a woman in charge he freely assumes the position of their second in command and willingly follows them.  in a witch shall be born  he starts the story as a queen s general  and when she is deposed he undertakes herculean efforts to restore her to power for no reasons other than he respects her and its his job.  progressives ignore the seeds of liberal thought to their detriment.  they have no idea how we got to where we are because they discard the entire past as  not good enough.
I always thought it was kinda cool that in the howard stories there s never a conan origin story. you just get bits and pieces on his journey from barbarian to king.
conan what is best in life    crush the sjws  see them driven before you and hear the reeeeeeing of the karens!
Im a tom boy   I dont even feel Im equipped for that . I laughed.
its awesome to see that every time I watch a new video of yours you ve gained around 1 000 subs. the channel is growing! eh. 2022 and we re still having people push the toxic masculinity talking point .
Im still beyond ticked at how they treated the wheel of time.  Ive read the entire series 4 times so far and into my 5th and  even knowing amazon would screw it up  decided to at least give the first episode a chance.  made it  roughly  10 minutes in before I had to  goosfrabba  my way out of the room.  for the books  sometimes the very long and detailed world building can  admittedly  get...well  long  but  I fell in love with so many of the characters that thats easy to forgive.  so what they did with 2 of the mains early on was a straight up abomination and infuriating.  it boggles my mind how fans of the books are like   this is fine.   ugh.
I find it most apt that the showrunners for the amazon conan ended up doing hotd for hbo to destroy trop. Im a serious lifelong hardcore conan fan loving the reh stories as a child. I hope  condal et al can do a gritty  aggressive  and barbarous hypermasculine  violent  sexual  raw  and compelling series in the future.
very good news   as a conan fan   I appreciate amazon not doing conan .they would probably make conan  to reflect the world we live in today
you know we live in weird times when we actually celebrate studios not doing  read  ruining  a series
very glad to hear this considering the current climate of butchering some of my favorite things. with that being said - relegating conan to a hyper male fantasy role is very much over simplifying things. the female characters of belit  captain of the pirate vessel tigress  from the story  queen of the black coast  - and valeria of the red brotherhood from the story  red nails  - provide very strong female roles at a time of storytelling where that was not the norm. anyone who enjoys conan in popular media I strongly urge to read the robert e. howard stories of the character that in many ways differs from the portrayals in film and tv.
the reboot with jason mamoa comes to mind.
now it will be netflix  that will be ruining conan.
exactly  look at what they did to Lord of the rings
@indian 2080s  at least that movie is not woke despite it failed hard
arnie was a good conan in 1982. jessImomacoa was a joke. but neither of them are conan only robert e. howard s books depict conan. every other version is fanfiction.
I feel bad for robert rodriguez
@steve britton  no its not Lord of the rings its woke of the rings.
@cj isawesome  my point exactly. imagine if the same people who did that did the same thing to conan
as someone who read the original 12 books  I thoroughly agree. in today s environment  they could never even top the 1982 arnold movie.
idk I think conan could be the right thing to show us how stories can be done right. just look at primal. genndy wanted to make a conan series but the ip owner said no. so he made something heavily inspired by it and it was massively popular.but its sad to see what happened to y last man.
@thesailsman  I think primal was successful because it was an original story. Im kinda glad the ip owner said no. at this point  I would like them to leave my favorite characters alone.
@viktor vondoom  I think it could ve worked as both. Im happy with the original series we got but I could easily see him adapting conan right.
@thesailsman  I can see that. its just that we finally have an original character and not another remake reboot reimagining
@viktor vondoom  either way this  primal  was built off heavy inspiration. the main characters  names  were taken from robert e howard s first published work.
@thesailsman  I ll have to take your word for it. I have not seen primal but heard really good things about it. will have to get to itsome day.
@the magus  dead wrong.  the dark horse comics were amazing.  some of the best comics ever published.  did incredible justice to the source material.
conan would be non-binary  trans pregnant man woman
conan is just being placed on the back burner.  dont for a moment think they wont try to ruin him down the road.  it will happen.
@the magus  correct
@the magus  chuck dixon s run on savage sword of conan was pretty good fan fiction
@the magus  I liked the arnold films. but they didn t depict howard s conan  thats for sure.
it d be hilarious. disgusting   but hilarious. think of the memes   man!
though the same
hollywood  hold my beer.
@bathyal games  probably gonna last one season on netflix. not to mention terrible cgi.
I think with the right crew it could still be done. of course everything  mass marketed for wider audience trying to compete with got  will fail. but for example if george miller got his hands on conan  the results might be interesting.
just use marv from sin city  send him back in the bronze age  give him a sword  kill goldie and watch him go!
@fat kart  different miller  but I cant say that even in frank miller s hands conan would at least be interesting  p
agreed.
@the magus  neither of them looked like howard s conan either.they should ve got gerard butler as conan right after he d finished with 300.
@the magus  arnie was the best conan and closest to robert e howard so no  not fanfiction. momoa however is just not conan
invincible was okay. and the boys. just depends on the team doing the work not necessarily the parent company. but I agree it would be hit or miss for sure in this current climate and probably better not to risk it.
@john s.  no they absolutely did
@spr1ggan -  arnie was as close as youre gonna get  gerard not so much
@the nightman  thats not true at all. cimmerians are proto scots irish  howard was of scottish and irish descent and even the name conan is scottish and irish gaelic and means little wolf   arnold is not  conan has black hair  arnold does not  conan in the books is dsecribed as being able to move like a cat or have the agility of a cat  arnold most certainly does not and more resembles the stupid wwe build comic conan has. even mamoa was much closer in appearance to book conan than arnold was.
lol they tried a cartoon called primal and ended the last season with a daughter 2 female trex  and mom stealing the show
mel gibson as william wallace is the closest anyone ever got to conan
@the nightman  I cant disagree with that. you are right. but howard s conan in the novels was a lot more serious and tough. he was also more intelligent and never a slave. but yes you are correct in what you said.  cheers
@historia en celuloide  the guy is a hack
@justin  actually true
@justin  also imagine mel gibson level acting with an arnie voice   awesome conan
surely they could just change conan to a female transgender - then it will be fine
@the magus  I always thought conan would sound like kratos when I read the comics
@justin  thats not the voice I d imagine arnie had the voice but to each his own. arnold had that nordic germanic voice I d imagine conan having.  its a shame he didn t take the character seriously enough. but all in all he is the best film conan we have.
gay conan was the only way it was going to get made.
@the magus  but conan was not nordic or germanic. he was cimmerian. arnie just happened to have an austrian accent talking english. the best interpretation of conan is from frank frazzetta bar none.  its the closest look to how robert e. howard described him. arnie looked like a body builder but conan was a savage. I d say mel gibson is the closest playing william wallace.  big forearms   shoulders and hands  not aesthetically proportioned like arnie was.  remember conan was a savage  lifting and throwing rocks and swords and axes were the weapons  youre gonna have big hand and forearms.
yes ....its one of the last non raped franchises
@justin  wahmen kang!!!!!
yeah  it would ve been bait and switch garbage with a woman showing up conan at every turn.
@aaron humphrey  red sonja actually showed up conan a couple times and left him to fend for himself while she ran off with purse  if it was her doing it to him then
spartacus war of the dammed tv series is the closest to the conan spirit I have seen recently.episode 6 of thatseason has gannicus escaping from occupied sinuesa city...  that is pure conan style.
you dont want conan to have a black husband
oh def would of been  conan writer  he she brady bowen who doesnt have any hands or a tongue  so because of their handicap they write with their feet .magically might I add  they ve just never written anything before choreographer  derenia bless  they are blind  gay straight and perfect for the fluid poetry of combat. she is a pacifist fyidirector  idk  we are just going to pick someone from tent city that was a mailperson or something

@indian 2080s  I liked it. very vibrant movie.
my thoughts exactly - Im pretty sure robert e. howard would not have agreed with anyone  transforming  his superb ultimate warrior into a  woke fairy .....!
@mireadur  I haven t seen the movie. but apparently I have heard that the movie less bewbs   more violence   gore. which explains why it failed.
agreed.
I think you are so right.
lol disney   could totally take this on if he had diversified dwarfs as sidekicks ...  but beetlejuice is dead af
true
we need to start pooling our money and get ben shapiro to make a conan movie. I d have quinton tarantino direct for sure.
@the magus  and mamoa is pretty bad ass  that gives an inkling of what conan is
certainly not by amazon
@indian 2080s  yeah. terrible script   plot especially . I thought momoa was fine though.
he would probably be a second or third character in his own show  with red sonja being the main character. they probably do conan like he-man was done in the netflix version by kevin smith. so in a way I am glad it is cancelled  I love the conan character too much.
Imean  you act as if conan was this amazing film in the top 100 best of all time or something. it was a b list action flick and nothing more lol
@richard wand  personally  Im referring to the adaptation of any work from the books. for its time  the 1st conan was one of the only attempts to do this work and to at least try to stay true to feel of howards work  and with the production quality needed. could it have better  probably  as we can point out missteps  but look at what they were attempting  on what scale  with what tone  and in what era. it wasn t a technicolor fantasy sinbad film romp  though those will always have a soft spot in my heart...  was it the best film ever  no  but the best hardcore sword   sorcery fantasy  to date  actually  yes. the momoa film did more wrong  didn t aim as high  or try as hard  but at least it did also keep the tone and momoa is a better casting choice.
I would comment exactly that  but you came here faster.
@howard phillips  now Im going to have to go back and watch that one!
damnit! you beat me to it. was gonna say the same thing.
there s no way conan could be done right in this era of hollywood I guess you didn t see the jason mamoa remake then - that was s  t too.it can be done well  but only as long as its done by a studio that has the balls to allow a male protagonist to be the hero in his own franchise - even amazon s jack reacher struggles to do that with the unnecessary extension of roscore s character which is clearly designed to make an already prominent female character even more prominent just to show that they can  not to mention the random female investigator character not in the book that they invented again to add more female interaction for a series that is painfully obviously targeted to men.the studios seem to lack any ability to realise their market correctly and continue to pander to these ridiculous bechdel test type criteria in films and tv series based on properties that were simply not designed for it.
exactly
@steve britton  they them of the rings
@pet boy  conan doesnt really need much cgi. the more realistic  albeitsavage  the better in said universe. even with the magic.
@spr1ggan -  butler is too tall and thin  even after 300. possibly sam heughan  if they beefed him up more than was done for outlander.
@kainis01  the problem with sam is that he doesnt have an intimidating look about him that for example guys like butler or dougray scott can pull off. in terms looking like conan though  if you took a younger dougray scott and beefed him up  he d nail it. saying that though book conan is not built like arnold was or what we see in the comics  in the books he s very athletic and agile.
@spr1ggan -  he was built to look powerful  yet agile. he often was referred to as moving like a tiger. I would agree thatscott could possibly pull off a king conan. not a younger version though. mamoa during his got days was probably the closest of the look that we will get  unfortunately.  I think sam  could  be made to look more intimidating. Imean hell  considering how they were able to make butler seem like a decent leonidas  they should be able to do the same with sam.
@kainis01  Imeant a younger dougray scott  not current scott for younger conan. 300 butler would be massive compared to the average person. also iirc conan was said to move like a panther which while powerful is smaller and leaner than a tiger. back to sam  I dont know how you can make him more intimidating  he doesnt have the cold piercing stare  butler pulls this off with ease  I d expect someone like conan to have. he should be able to intimidate even before opening his mouth or raising a weapon.anyway its at netflix now so we re going to get cw style d d with the conan name slapped on. no ethnic differences  every single tribe and nation will be a mix  american accents everywhere  conan the simp  and horrific costume design.
it ll be fine in a few decades
hail robert e. howard!!!!!!
amen.
except conan has always been cheesy and bad lol
a modern  conan adaptation would be about some side character female with half her head shaved going off to go rescue conan from the big bad heterosexual wizard
@thesailsman  only people like genndy shou do stories like that
what s funny is that the guy who was going to work on this was fired by amazon. then got hired to do house of the dragon. it was going to be awesome. the funny thing is amazon actually helped their competition buy firing this guy lol.
@indian 2080s  in fairness momoa was a great choice for conan. story plot was lacking
100  with you right there. Im so glad its got cancelled  it would of been a absolute joke.
its so fucking sad how accurate this statement is. if you dont like the property leave the property the hell alone. look at what amazon did to lotr.
netflix will do the same.they should just do red sonja she s a female conan . they would have there powerful female character.  instead they do conan because its a bigger recognized name. then they will  make him into some type of soy boy and over shadow him with some female character.
maybe conan can be disney-fied
@studio shitake takashita  true they could give him blue hair and a pair of tits.then build him like thin muscley soy boy  think indor rock climbing professionals  so  when other girl characters show up they can look more manly than conan.  in his own story in this way they can belittle and laugh and  humiliate him.2 of my very favorite comic book heroes are submariner and hawkman they have both heald very high positions in there superhero teams.2 characters that dont get much love anymore. with black adam coming to the big screen and both my favorite  characters being in it. I cant see the rock allowing the woke industry to highjack his movie to insert there message.God I hope not. I here bullet train with bad pit   is doing really well without the message .everyone knows how well tom cruise  top gun movie is doing without the message.who knows how long it will be if submariner    hawkman  will ever be in a nother big budget movie.I just turned 60 started collecting in the late 60s I really do feel so lucky to se my heroes in the big screen at a time where the special effects make my heroes real!.captain america is my favorite from the start. I dont think I will ever see a better cap that I have already gotten.superman spiderman dare devilbatman ironman green goblin lexx luther  sandman the mighty red skull and of course the joker. every superhero needs a really dangerous supper vilian.all great.all I can do now is hope I get to see my last few heroes as true superheroes .
sure he could. he could fight for social justice issues of 210bc
I disagree. of course he can be done right. if they aim for their right audience.
same so glad they are not touching it
have you seen primal
facts
@cj isawesome  woke of the rings  the thieves in power!
@the anime music video geek God  thats excellent .
I agree. a conan adaptation must have to wait until this war against everything masculine is won.eventually they will come to realise why men have been men for the past 20000 years of human civilisation
funnily enough  you sound like you ve not seen the movies because you write them off pretty easily despite having strong female characters  as well. and racial diversity that wasn t forced.
@mage oh youre completely right.conan would be dead if not for valeria.and thats in the arnold movie.she didn t watch it.
@ken diamond  yes valaria and zula.
I also like zenobia.
if you enjoyed the conan stories I d recommend checking out robert e. howard s other stories. solomon kane would be a good start. if youre looking for other strong female characters check out some of his dark agnes stories as well. her character is a young woman forced into an arranged marriage by her abusive father but escapes by killing her would-be husband. she flees and ends up being trained by a mercenary as a swordswoman. think arya stark done right.
and edgar rice burrough s barsoom stories. john carter is both savage and suave.
and yasmina
@peter janssen  really anything  of the pulps . the shadow  doc savage  zorro  philip marlowe  the phantom. its actually crazy how much the superhero and fantasy genres owe to the likes of authors like walter b. gibson  raymond chandler  robert e. howard  etc.
I grew up reading the conan stories written by robert e. howard  l. sprague de camp  and lin carter. the cover illustrations were usually painted by frank frazetta.
best belit comes from the original marvel conan the barbarian from issue 58 I think  to 100 where she dies. fantastic run of belit and conan.
there is one man who could pull it off  if he ever does live action films ...genndy tartakovsky
valeria is awesome too  a very  feminist  character   for the time where it was written  it was quite progressive !  also olivia for example  while not being a warrior  is a princess who chose to build her destiny after flying from slavery  and has nice character development.
nah they ll be fine. people are still paying lmao. not me but plenty of others
conan was written by robert e. howard on the basis and example of three different men he knew. conan is the true and real maleness condensed in one character.
that is rather good of conan  not toxic. youremember what exact title of the book this came from
@bluecollie55_movies  I dont off hand. I ll see if I can find it.
well said
which story is that from
that comic run was 11 10.  amazing start to finish.
@andrew boyer  I whole heartedly agree!
my favourite is in the queen of the black coast  when conan is put on trial and the judge threaten him to make him testify against his friend. he figures the the judge has gone mad  and so he kills him and rides away. and the guards are like  sure we can chase after him. but we dont get paid enough to catch up to him!  xd
@lenny ztrobos  thats the beginning of the book  after he killed the judge he went on sea.
frost giants daughter  a classic and frank frazhetta painted it well. hail conan  scourge of the hyborian age lol
fact is robert e howard was a self claimed feminist  just because he write about a masculin hero doesnt make it toxic
sighs I refer you to  queen of the black coast   wherein conan was the one attacking defenseless people. there also was another story wherein conan has a romance with a queen while declaring  with apparent sincerity  that he was going to raid her people as much as he liked. oh yeah also the one where he threw a prostitute into a pit and left her to die for some reason.youre thinking of the movie television show cartoon conan I guess.-an anonymous nerd
@an anonymous nerd  conan was never really good guy he often roamed the moral greys and his savage ways.
@frostwolfpack  yes  in the books. I d actually argue he was relatively evil  piracy  raiding  rape  etc.   and was only doing heroic deeds by coincidence or for selfish motives.my point is that a conan show wouldn t work unless they changed that  unless folks wanted a fantasy  breaking bad.  so no matter what they are likely to  for the better  change that part of the character. for the most part the movie adaptations have hewed closer to good guy stereotypes with some roguish thief-ish stuff thrown in  and that was decades ago -- but they still made the character considerably more heroic and sympathetic than he was in the books.-an anonymous nerd
robert howard was great for moments like that where the mc walks in on a bad situation and gets strait to business.my favorite was when solomon kain comes across a near dead woman in the road. takes a few minutes to comfort her in her last moments of like  then stands up and says  men will die for this
carey nord art... such a great run.
my favorite was when he escaped from prison  but on his way out he ran back in to stomp on a guard s head real fast.
@an anonymous nerd  I d stay anonymous too if I was as dishonest or inept at reading as you are. why did you make this blatantly false comment  you sound like a progressive leftist.  are you
@frostwolfpack  dont argue conan with a guy who knows nothing about it and spouts off false bs. Im referring to anonymous nerd
@an anonymous nerd  this 100    sword and sorcery in the nutshell here
worth saying  rape absolutely does happen in the conan universe but conan never rapes any women. he even boasts of it at one point.so the anonymous nerd needs to reread the original stories before he shoots his mouth off like that.
that is a prime example of toxic masculinity actually. the raiders were just trying to survive.  s
frost giants daughter is my favorite comic ever  and I think it would be a great movie.I love when they are near the end and conan hunts down the men who betrayed him and his adopted viking family. he cuts them down mercilessly. when the sheriff confronts him he explains their crime  that the money they have on them will pay for the damages  and dares the law man to try to arrest him.when asked  what will we do with the bodies  conan replies  knowing that the vikings wish to be creamated so they can enter valhalla   bury them.
yes bc women should be defend them self  bc they are independent strong women
@an anonymous nerd  tbf thats a rather disingenuous take. considering the setting and people in it he s hardly evil for the piracy and raiding and as far as Im aware conan has never raped any woman.
the... power of the vag is simply this  what you cant muscle  and there s a lot of that  you have to smart. in a middle age setting  the state of vag over 12 years of age is  full of child .
@bluecollie55_movies   in she hulk they had her save bruce banner from a car crash .
the people that call this  toxic masculinity   probably was expecting a woman to pull a sword out of nowhere defeat all the raiders and say...  I need no man to defend me . lmao
trans-conan.. conny
I believe  men  should deal with the mess which  men  caused. thats not toxic. this is more fair way.
@paul-antony whatshisface  nope  piracy and raiding is evil even when its on a place called  the black coast.  oh and at minimum he tries really hard in  the frost giant s daughter   and thats like the minimum. so  no  not disingenuous unless by disingenuous you mean  accurate  in which case youre using the word wrong.-an anonymous nerd
yes  conan is not always toxically masculine. and you can be masculine in a non-toxic ethically and morally upright way.
the short stories are good  but howard did his most epic work with the longer serialized stories   red nails    hour of the dragon  and  the phoenix on the sword
you probably should read the original books.....      and dont tell me you did ....the schwarzenegger movie was kinda funny  but hardly a reflection of the original conan character as portrayed by robert e. howard.
arnold conan was a good movie  but a shit tier conan movie because it wasn t intended to be a conan movie. they got the rights to the movie as his standard sword and sorcery movie was wrapping up production.
@chocolatebadness  cool detail - thanks for sharing !
@maubast777  Imean it was better then the crap reboot we got with jason mamoa lol
you win the internet!
...you not only cantolerate but enjoy te reeeeing of karens  you are sick.
by crom  thats a good one.
@raximus3000  crom laughs at the reeeeeing of the karens  laughs from his mountain!
read that in schwarzenegger s voice
genius comment...
that is good
lol
thank you so much  y all have been so supportive and amazing with leaving comments and likes on my video. it has helped me a ton with growth
@melonie mac go boom  ahh the queen replied to me!!! congratulations with the success this channel is getting. dont stop speaking your mind. I feel represented by your views.
because there is still widespread toxic masculinity.
I needed that today xd
@madiq ismal  we all did.
yes  that is good. but what about the open step  hawk on wrist  wind in your hair !
greatest comment ever!
yes!
lol perfect!
seems legit.
yes  that is best in life
take my like damn you.
@darran coyle  wrooooooooong!!!!  .... even if its so right  ___  !
this is an s-tier comment
yes!!!
best answer! lololol
yeah  I approve of that
you beat me to it
good one.
hahahah hell yes.
hear the lamentation of the feminists.
thank you sir may I have another
gold
gold dude. thats gold.
love it!
I agree.  Imade it a bit farther than you in the first episode  but I was drunk.  this also made me so angry that I had to stop or I would break something.  I was a huge fantasy fan when I was younger.  even as a kid my mother would go to the mall  and I would just tell her to leave me in the b. dalton store while she shopped. when this show came out  I thought I d give it one last try to watch the spew hollywood  screw your auto-correct  I will not capitalize it  has been putting out.  Ive given up on any show these days  even the ones that people say aren t woke and good.  the wheel of times series  broke my heart  my back  and my interest in live action anything.
ll
what is the secret of steel
conan is the ultimate man! he does not cry  others cry for him!
been reading the cimmerian comic adaptations. having a hard time picturing them wokifying the one where conan chokes out a viking Goddess because he s tired of her both harassing him and flicking her bean to dudes killing each other over her.
holy crapyour opinions and views on what is happening to our fandoms and culture is such a much needed breath of fresh air!!thanku sooo freakin much!!subscribed
conan is way too awesome  badass and manly for hollywood. the original books by robert e. howard are metal as hell lol.
hollywood needs to stop hiring activists. period. the job of a writer is to make money  not propaganda.
conan is like mad max he doesnt need an origin  just throw him into a hairy situation get some popcorn and enjoy the carnage.  bonus points if you can somehow get the hu to guest as traveling bards or something.
I hope netflix goes through with the conan series and itsticks to the original robert e howard stories.  I fell in love with conan in a college literature class when we studied pulp fiction authors like howard  lovecraft  lin carter  sprague de camp. etc.  carter and de camp did a good job expanding on conan from howard s notes.
what is absolutely insane is that amazon could be dominating everything if they would just go to the fans if they would just go to regular writers instead of trying to push stuff the kind of money they have they could probably dwarf marvel well they definitely could now
the irony is the showrunner for this was ryan condal and apparently the scripts were really good. then amazon kicked him to the curb. well he went over to hbo and became the showrunner for house of the dragon and got thatshow fast into production when hbo was having terrible luck getting any of the got prequels off of the ground. so really condal got to have the last laugh on amazon.
great show and analysis. thanks for the hard work. chris
100 . what s really interesting is the two conan movies in the early 80s not only had great diversity  black  asian  and hispanic actors all had important roles   but the first movie in particular gave a lot of power cred to valeria...the badass female thief played by sandahl bergman who conan falls for  and who fights like a demon  against demons!  to give conan a second lease on life. in other words - as much as conan is a male power fantasy  the 82 film actually balanced this out quite a lot  without robbing conan of his strength - and yet  we know  if hollywoke was to do conan now  not even that would cut it. not even valeria and conan working as a team together with subotaI would be pc enough. they d probably bait and switch it. thank God it got cancelled.
frankly  Im very pleased by this news because conan is the epitome of male badassery. personally  I d love to see someone like zack snyder take on a conan movie or series! after  300   he proved that he has everything to give it the proper treatment!
Im a big conan fan  Ive read a lot of the books. I saw recently in another youtube video about conan that the conan license is available to turn into a movie tv show but the rights holders have the final say and they say conan stays just the way he is. enjoy conan the barbarian to its savage fullest!
well that makes me happy.  conan has been one of my favorite characters since I first learned that fiction books existed.  I consider this a win.  maybe after the collapse of follywood and a real entertainment industry rises from the ashes we may see movies and tv series again.
at this point I d be happy with the 1990 s animated conan series as long as schwarzenegger re-records the dialogue for all 78 episodes.
you know what I like the most about all the wokification and the butchering of old classics  - the wonderful irony that channels like yours or nerdrotic  critical drinker  Lord dvd  and so many more that its too much to type  are simply exploding lately... it works so much in your favour guys and Im so happy about it.. keep up the great work of calling out the bs!
amazon drop a conan the barbarian series. thank God it has since moved over to netflixdear God
keep putting out your content I really like it I really like your points of view and I also like you thinking you seem like a pretty normal and pretty good youtube commentator and person who talks about our pop culture I really like your take on it please continue to put out more content I will be subscribing to you
we seriously need a resurgence of 80 s action movies. hyper macho  over the top and ultra violent. oh and speaking of origin stories  Im pretty sure the entirety of the conan story is just the origin story of the doom slayer.
you give me hope for the world  melonie.  thanks.
writers do write propaganda
actually the job of a writer should be to entertain audiences. making money should just be a desired side effect. am I living in a dream world  yes. am I still correct  yes.
@tool21  no  in today s movie environment  making money is the top priority. they cant take risks on movies people will love if it cant make enough money to make a profit. matt damon talked about that on hot ones recently.
@thenightowlks  yeah  I totally get that. but as with everey job  the end product will be better if people are working on it that are driven by more than greed for profit and actually love what they are doing and have a real talaent. you can just tell the difference. so many cheap remakes recently give you the feels of a cash grab and ultimately dived at the box office.
@tool21  so many inexperiences  naivety and loopholes in your comment
actually since the cia runs hollywood  their job is literally propaganda. money is a non issue at this point since they can print infinite amounts of it
@sparky  can you elaborate  why
hollywood itself is a propaganda machine
@tool21  no  he cant because he is merely a cynic  while you are an idealist. he s just jealous that you see the glass as half full.
@thenightowlks  its not even exclusive to today s environment. the film industry has always been a business. money has always been the driving factor for studio projects for as long as there have been film studios.
@cody sinclair  it is even moreso in today s environment because they dont have the vhs dvd sales profits to make money on with streaming services now being the dominant home medium.
@thenightowlks  for sure. I just meant to say that the film industry has always been about profits. we re just seeing the industry evolve with the times as well as seeing the industry react to what audiences themselves are paying to see. its not entirely the studio s fault that they dont want to produce riskier films when the data clearly shows that mainstream audiences dont pay to see them in theaters.
the job of a writer s to entertain us  not preach! preaching is propaganda!
think they do it to fill out quota to show of how diverse they are and keep a good esg rating as result they get activist hiring s.
first and foremost  their job is to engage and entertain! woke garbage fails at this miserably.
@tool21  I agree. although our view on the matter would be considered too idealistic  I d much rather prioritize entertainment and inspiration over monetary gain any day. money s necessary but its far from everything
esg hiring process.  start looking under the hood of corporations.
the job of a writer is to write a compelling and entertaining story. its then the studios job to turn that into money.I ll agree with the  stop hiring activists  part though
they dont care how much money the lose. the liberal agenda is more important...
conspiracy hollywood creates a drought in quality film to lower standards for movies and series so much that if a movie has minimal effort put in to it that it  looks like a masterpiece in comparison  saving them money in quality of production. but I know its not the case  movies and series are shit lately
what I dont get with all that woke stuff - where is the counter movement  arent there any anti-woke directors and studios  how come they all jump on that train  I think there would be big money to be made by making shows wich are deliberatly not politically correct  given the hate woke culture stirs up
youre wrong. the job of a writer is to write a good story.
not make money  no  but to tell stories.and good storytelling and propaganda in general do not marry well. woke feminist propaganda in particular is nigh anathema to good storytelling.
daniel moir  just stop hiring karens  melonie quote  . . .  so they hired a  karen .  floored me
for a writer to make money  they must produce at the very least a good generic product  to make a lot of money they have to produce something truly great.
yeah true  writers and artists should never take political stances. they should just write for money.
she-hulk writer are the worst
amen!
it is often good to be an activist. and propaganda is not always false. it is merely a set of statements  or expressions of an ideology  and as such can contain information that can be true as well as false.
hollywood ruined the characters of conan and tarzan  both written in the early part of the 20th century by pulp writers. conan and tarzan had several things in common. they were positive role models of true masculinity. meaning they used their strengths to protect the weak against evil doers. they also were utterly ruthless once they decided you were an enemy. hollywood made tarzan woke in the very first movies 70  years ago. if you have never read the original tarzan books  you will be surprised at just how ruthless he was. the same is true of conan. enemies were not spared. thanks again. chris
because in conan universe  its similar to our universe. there s chinese  african  arab  spanish  viking  german and pirate
@bobo boy  yes  I know. robert e howard s vision of hyboria was set in prehistoric times on our own planet.
spot on I keep hearing hollywood tell me that we need strong female characters valeria was a great female character she respected conan and conan respected her
thats nit unique tI the movies the creator was a old school feminist  who wrote female characters mix some damsels some powerful queens or sorcercess
@demonic_myst  um  first of all please fix your typos   thats not unique to the....  . secondly  did I say it was  unique   nope  I didn t. I just gave an example of two movies doing the same kind of thing disney amazon are trying to do  but doing it much better  a long time ago. thatsaid  if your input is that these films were made like that because of the influence of raffaella de laurentiis as producer  then cool  thank-you thats interesting to learn. of course  I know the name dino de laurentiis  wasn t aware his daughter had worked on this.doesnt change what s been said in this thread btw. eg.  valeria was a great female character she respected conan and conan respected her . that actually I do find pretty damn close to unique in fantasy movies btw. arwen in jackson s trilogy no doubt is another. if you have any other examples that were actually successful  come on  cough them up.
valeria was a badass character and one of the best things in the original conan movie. I do not understand why modern screenwriters and producers are so afraid of howard s works  as he had a lot of interesting and quite diverse characters in conan stories. yes  its cliche and there are a lot of women who serve only as voluptuous trophies  but there are women like bloodthirsty b lit and original valeria of the red brotherhood. he also created other strong females in his other works like red sonya of rogatino  the shadow of the vulture  and dark agnes de la fere  sword woman  blades for france . yasmina  who is more of a damsel in distress type  has strong personality  she s witty  smart and can handle herself.even in the color department  where you can clearly see that howard is a guy from early xx century texas  you have strong and self-sufficient black or  asian  characters. yes  its robust as hell  brutal  merciless but thats how hyborian age is supposed to work.
@przybyszzmatplanety  love your comment there  Ive always meant to read more howard  now you ve inspired to do just that learn more about all these awesome sounding characters you ve described!
@dewulfe99  if your like conan  try out solomon kane another great reh characters.
@sister _ stygian  cool I will  thanks for the tip!
@dewulfe99  anytime!
@bobo boy  german sorry  I am not a big conan fan  but do you actually mean german as in germany or do you germanic  because there s a difference between german and germanic.
netflix are 2x worst than amazon.
@bobo boy  from the cloudburst into the waterfall.
chances are that conan will be black
pls tell me youre kidding.
@akula doctor  an obese blue-haired woman of color on a wheelchair. brave  stunning and beautiful.
@akula doctor  wilt chamberlain as bombaata enters the room...
in italy we say there isn t end to the worse... from amazon to netflix  thats a good example!
they however  destroyed not one but two ips. I do wonder what goes through these people s heads. seeing a beloved ip then thinking  hey let s modernize it.  all most all the time  its not made for the fans.
you never know what you ll get from that company  they did an awesome job on daredevil and the punisher.
I dont think God had anything to do with it.
oh dear God it gets worse
Im glad to find a channel with a level headed woman. I am so tired of the woke shit  I just want people to go to the crazy normals they were before all this brainwashing. your awesome  all day long!
hello  new subscriber here. and yep  Im a guy  as a conan fan I thank you for this video  its perfectly stated  and also if Imay  thank you to amazon for not ruining yet another existing property that is perfectly fine the way it is  now if netflix can do it right  well  I suppose that is another matter for another time. love your channel!
please dont ruin conan too. there isn t much left that is good and pure. let him stay in the blissful realm of forgotten by hollywood and kept in the hearts and minds of the fans who truly care. conan should live  breathe  love and slay and I will be content.
I dont know how these people go so far into left field other than ego and  like you said  wanting to tell their own versions of these stories. if I was going to adapt an existing ip I would just take the ip  episode by episode  and have a quality script writer adapt the ip into scripts. then I d do an animated show because you can make the characters look exactly how they should from the ip and easily add in any special effects or locations as well as do adult scenes without all that mess with irl actors. we can even do very realistic animation these days although stylistic tends to age better. then get quality voice actors to play the characters because this is an existing ip  people want it quality. and I could do it all for probably half or less than what these mega studios are producing crap for.
the 1st time Ive saw a video by this lady!! ty ty  ty! very smart young lady!!! just when I was about to give up hope for anyone under age of 50! love you girl! keep speaking truth and I will keep trashing the woke!
honestly I see this as a blessing in disguise.
I can still remember getting excited for new movies. the good old days
its more about  what they are  than  what they did  nowadays and it keeps backfiring because the fans care about the latter more than the former  despite what vocal twitter claims  as if they watch the movies and shows and support the creations through and through
the core of masculinity is to build and protect. these endeavors are how masculine traits are expressed in a healthy way. a person could express masculine traits by building a community  a company  a house  a family  a garden or any other constructive endeavor. a person could also express masculine traits by protecting their family  friends  coworkers  neighbors  etc. this is not limited to physical protection. someone expressing healthy masculinity also protects others  emotional and psychological well-being. its toxic when masculine traits are used to destroy and or harm e.g. bullies. like the bullies on twitter and the woke mob who attack and destroy.
good observation  about our favorite properties getting a tv treatment . these days when you hear your favorite stuff is going to tv you get that michael scott  please God no!  meme running through your head.
conan does not need an origin story.  he just is.  he s conan and thats all we need to know about him.
this was my first time seeing you in recommendations  loved your video and I agree 100  with everything you said. you got a new subscriber here.
great video and commentary. as a huge conan reader since six years.  I agree.  better to leave the moody cimmerian alone than tarnish and spoil him for today s blind politics. subscribed!
youre the first based woman that does these pop news videos that Ive seen. sub. keep up the good work.
youre so right melonie about how we were once excited about hearing that our favorite characters or franchises were getting a new show...now when we hear that  we wonder   ok. how bad are they planning to ruin it   . I do miss the days when respect for a story  or character was a thing  and new writers would do what they could to pay homage to the original legacy.  like what peter jackson did for lotr. love your channel  btw.
all the  fantasy  talk scared me. Im afraid they were trying to shoehorn conan into the high fantasy genre instead of the swords and sorcery genre that he s always belonged in.
they want to do origin stories because its much easier as the story is already outlined for them. writing a sequel is much harder as you have to create something new  obviously just look at got s07 s08 where they did not have grrms story to rely on .
thanks for this. it worked for the expanse oddly  because they made it more of a what if. in the book it happens this way so what if this character was present and so on. conan should be done by hbo. their screenwriters write better stories. looking at rings of power vs. house of the dragons I dont think I need much more evidence for this.
as a life long fantasy fan I have to say that rh conan stories are my absolute favorites surpassing even lotr  in my humble opinion  which they predate.
conan just dodged a bullet. I d like to see the company that did the animation in  spiderverse   perform an animated conan movie. the movie s content would adapt 2 or 3 of robert e. howard s actual short stories. amazingly and confoundingly  I dont think its ever been done on screen. everyone in hollywood gets ahold of the property  ignores robert e. howard  and have presented nearly nothing true to the  great  source material.  I never got past arnold s conan having brown hair and pushing a wheel of pain to explain how buffed he became.  Imean they adapted at least a half dozen of ian fleming s bond books and short stories.
right! its probably best to sleep on conan for a while till some small  creative  start up can get the ip and make something more like dredd.
its already been remade
clearly you havent seen what marvel and dc have done with him
did you see the tv series  it was already ruined.
conan was being ruined since early days of marvel taking up the license. what you got to do is accept a certain canon for conan and accept that the rest is just fanfiction. for me conan canon are the stories of robert e. howard and the l. sprague de camp books that finished the stories of conan that robert e. howard wrote  while everything else is just bad fanfiction.
it will be six years until conan is out of the woods  so to speak.
noooo! you vill vatch ze black lesbian conan and you vill be happy!
there s always red sonja... wonder how they ll ruin that...
@bathyal games  yup unless the creators put it in writing that his orgin can be altered then everything else is not canon and just fan fiction. I  m gonna go ahead and say something controversial batman no kill rule is not canon either is it popular  yes! but canon it is not. bill finger and bob kane said so in a news report  no kill rule was only to appease the comicbook ratings board. they never said it was canon moving forward. I still want my old school vigilante batman the kills when necessary.
fredrik malmberg wont allow anything to happen to this character
if conan has become public domain  there s little we can do to stop anyone from doing anything with him.
better yet  read the original stories by robert e. howard. they re much better than any adaptation.
connans got a good game going atleast with a team that resoected the material enough that its one only games u can enslave your enemies and make them work for u
@demonic_myst  slaves  no. I call them forced friends. lol
dunno the latest conan movie already was cringe af.
well said hammer of thor. mr mjolnir.
that 2011 conan movie was the shit. thats to say conan was conan and it was filled with plenty bared skin of the female variety.   I cant imagine that a conan show today would be as good.   oh well we still got conan exiles  video game
yeah conan is something that works perfectly as something where true fans write stories on weathered paper and share them with each other on forums. primitive  rough and pure. no need for some hollywood hotshot to write his her  this is my modern take on the classic hero and takes him to the new age  plastic
lots of word but getting nowhere with this topic
I dont know I think he makes alot of sense with this topic.
@game freak  you need to read more..obviously
you forgot leadership.
@patrick  thats a component of building.
to protect you also need to destroy. to build is often from rumbles. to substaine or build a company you have to steal. every foundation is through sacrifices. either from your own hands or someone elses.  masculinity as well with feminity isnt black and white. good or bad goes hand in hand  but we have a tendency to justify bad and unwanted behaviour and most rather blame someone else for your own mistake rather than face them head on and do something. this is why I pesonally hate the word toxic masculinity. since its simplify a bigger problem and that problem is never one sided.
women and children can protect themselves   ummm  yeah
@robert bee  your comment makes no sense.
@game freak  words
they re not a  woke mob.   they are the  anti-inclusive mob.   women can also do the same things that you cite as masculine traits. these traits express the best qualities of both men and women.
@dondragmer  I never said women can not express masculine traits  however  core feminine traits are creation and nurturing. and before you start mouthing off  yes men can express those traits too. but at least you are starting to think  so good job.
the new judge dredd movie was pretty decent too. its a shame they didn t get to produce the trilogy like they wanted.
yes  perfect! pj s lotr trilogy is motion picture magic at its best  imo. all because he stayed mostly true to canon  admitted when he made changes and tried to make them not derail things too badly  and also made it a point to not include any modern references so as to render his take effectively timeless. as opposed to a certain piece of hot garbage on amazon prime video right now that is deservedly dying a thousand deaths because woke activists dont know when to leave well enough alone.
I think a lot of people posting their comments didn t actually watch the video. amazon were going to do a great conan  one that was true to the character - andre specifically stated that the scripts condall wrote were amazingly good and true to the source material. its because the conan series was so true to the source material that it got cancelled. if it was woke garbage like wheel of time or rangs of power   hearing some talk about my giiiiirl galadrigal!111   amazon wouldn t have cancelled it. or to be more precise  jennifer salke wouldn t have cancelled it. she is responsible for the direction amazon has taken. direct your ire towards her.whether or not the netflix series is any good  we wont get to see what condall wrote  and thats a real shame. feminazis like salke are actively destroying our culture  ensuring that the properties we love are either corrupted by woke ideology or cancelled. she s an absolutely abhorrent person.
somehow sandahl bergman as valeria and grace jones as zula have been forgotten  despite that their personages and the way they acted out pretty well fitted the conan lore. also  they didn t exactly look like they were waiting to be saved by men or had to be reinforced in their self-consciousness as a woman and thats also who they were then and who they are now in real life. I assume thats authenticity and thats what s missing these days...
they absolutely neutered wheel of time.  the main protagonist if the books had 14 lines in all of season 1.  he was the viewpoint character for 90  of the book thatseason was based on.
the cimmerian would make an excellent tv show that you dont even need to write an origin story for. have it just be the daily struggles and adventures of conan much like the pulps are. maybe have an episode at the end of each season that kind of alludes to a bigger story.
adult swim s primal was the best version of a conan story we re ever gonna get again.
true story  when I was a very young man in very good shape  semi-pro football  I auditioned for a conan stunt show that they used to have. didn t get it. still bummed about it.
the lore of conan is completely antithetical to the woke mindset.they may have realized conan was just too deeply entrenched in all things alpha.
thank you for the good news  it turns out some things are still scared.
in the dark horse comics there s a pretty good origin story for conan  he becomes the strongest child in the village  fights some wild animals  meets a druid  fights alongside his people vs the vanir  then leaves to travel the world.
I actually thought the tomb raider reboot was pretty good. the first one had lara being a scared survivor  the second saw her ascending to becoming a badass force of nature  and the third was cool in that we actually got to team up with an ancient civilization in addition to exploring ruined temples and tombs. I walked away from shadows with a better appreciation for mayan art and culture  yeah  I dont think having a girlboss for a queen would necessarily be what actual mayans would go with  but the fact the devs wanted to do something a little different with the grand finale was understandable.a game that did the whole   interacting with ancient societies  thing better was ys 8  lacrimosa of dana  minor spoilers for ys 8  btw  go play it because its awesome . in that game  the first half of the game essentially tells two storylines  with series protagonist adol Christin working with a bunch of survivors after the cruiseliner they were on is sunken in a storm in the present day  and dana s escapades in the past. dana s chapters feel different  due in no small part to the fact thatshe s an actual character with dialogue  adol s dialogue is limited to occasional branching options  which never actually affect the story going forward. he doesnt even speak the lines  so dana having actual dialogue is the first big thing. second biggest difference between dana s chapters and adol s is that we get to run around in some pretty interesting urban environments. the story will later destroy these places  so getting to see the temples  streets  and houses as dana before exploring the ruined remains as adol really hits hard.
great vid  melonie. my cousin watched conan with me tonight for the first time. he loved it and I really enjoyed this vid.
fact   conan gets saved by multiple courageous women in the r.e.h. stories  he even marries one in gratitude and recognition of her smarts and bravery  and in doing so makes her queen of aquilonia. they have children too. that has to have women appeal!
thank crom that amazon did. no telling what they would do to conan. seriously  conan the wokebarian  hell nah!!!!
great coverage melonie... thank crom conan is safe for now.side note  loving the hair  looks great on you.
its ridiculous how companies are scared straight to get cancelled.
I wish I had money to make movies that hollywood wouldn t want to make...which is accurate and great content
we truly are living weird times when a movie adaptation of a beloved comic franchise gets scrapped or abandoned and the first thought is  thank God .
I hate saying woke too  when Im telling a current topic or event sometimes its just the only way to explain something quickly though
conan 1982   what is best in life to crush your enemies. see them driven before you. and to hear the lamentations of their women.conan 2022  what is best in life to order a vegan burger  take a picture of it and upload it to instagram.
he is conan  cimmerian  he wont cry  so I cry for him.
netflixso ethnic tribes wont exist and every faction  tribe  and nation will look exactly the same apart from clothing.
after seeing the kind of writers that work for amazon based on rop I have no idea why you would trust the claim that they were gonna  do conan right.
@timberwolf dan  did you watch midnight edge s video about this  the one referenced in this video  I believe the claim because it was made by andre  and the scripts were written by ryan condall. the fact that the show was cancelled for toxic masculinity is itself proof that they were gonna do conan right.
I did a little research on nellie andreeva and honestly  nothing stands out as having an agenda of the woke-type. most of her work is journalism not show writing but nothing says she couldn t do a good job. honestly  I d have been fine checking out the planned conan. sucks it got canned
so it was canceled because it was good  that tracks
@spr1ggan -  amazon does the same. look at the diverse haradrim and elves and numenorians of rings of power. you cant tell where you are each time unless the show tells you
not woke. being woke is not garbage. it is a good thing because it means being awakened to systemic injustices against oppressed minorities within societies. you mean being against ethnic and cultural diversity or inclusiveness.
wont happen or wont be true to lore  cimmerians are proto scots irish and you cant use those accents without americans refusing to watch it because they cant understand it and they wont use subtitles.
agreed. atleast for a while.
you think they care look at the bond movies....
but if they gender-swapped him and made him conania the barbaress  then the very same actions would have changed from toxically masculine to stunning  brave and empowered.
@revilo178  I would of been okay with that of she was the daughter of conan. but as you described nah. but a female barbarian love interest is not so bad.
@revilo178  and fun  stuff is sonja was precursor of badass female trope.
funny on that the creator of connan was a feminist  the genre itself just is what it is a amoral world where heroes want woman and money their was strong frmale characters in conan often leaders like the pirate queen I forgot her name
@demonic_myst  I dunno about book conan original author being feminist  but he certainly didn t create mindless sludge characters. I for a fact quite liked it when he created some more interesting female ones. pirate queen rocked and that queen he met in desert did too.   I read pretty much most of conan books and its more then 40 tomes so I dont remember which it was  . in fact I wouldn t say its even the grating bitchyness of characters that is that annoying to fans but the fact that they are not dynamic characters while still possesing the most arrogance of whole crew that is making people become turned off. there is hardly a story for men about a dude who is taking drugs  then kills all his enemies and goes back to taking drugs  its just not an attractive story with no lessons learned nor any character developement. and back to example its because women in conan even while being tough warriors have normal human reactions  can mourn fallen friends  fall in love  that it makes a good reading. in modern fantasy it lacks in that aspect basically becoming kind of a thing movie conan was   even worse then it because essentially while movie conan was dumbed down to nearly just a brute  he still learned something along the way and was in emotionally painful situations  in fact most of driving force behind conan is tragedy  even if its  obscured by big guy with a sword trope  in modern media there is none of that.sorry for that chaotic essay  I just kind of came upon idea after idea as I started to write.
@jakub rogacz   I wasn t judging I just mean the author had stated he was a feminist at his time   and kind of kind of not the entire point of the genre is their amoral lessios  learned isnt really the goal  not all literature teaches lesions some stories are written just to be enjoyed
@demonic_myst  belit
conan  the king of respecting your feelings  lmao.
just imagine a non-binary transsexual conan in they quest to defeat the empowered lesbian she-witch thulsa doom with the help of the totally african warrior red sonja.
wokenan the barbrokeian.
amazon would probably make it conanne
wokebarelyman.
they would likely make him a poisonous jerk  and make valeria the superior focus of the show.
conan the questioning
conan what is best in life    to crush your enemies  dox and shadow ban them and cry with their non-sys women!
they would turn him into the soybarian.
to be fair to lore  I doubt crom would ve been the one to intervene to prevent it from happening lmao. thank mitra instead.
no. you dont understand that conan for amazon was being written by the guy who is writing house of the dragon for hbo max and he was writing an amazing conan script. but now conan is at netflix and they will utterly ruin it.
@roman arriaga  I played a mitra priest in the mmo back around 2011  tbh I had no idea mitra is part of the canon.
they adapted reacher pretty faithfully  no
conan the librarian. he d go around and sternly   shhhh   people.
wouldnt be a barbarian  thats barbaric
thanking crom is pointless.  crom does not care.  to call the attention of crom is only likely to cause him to send out dooms from his mountain.
@paul miller  if youre having a particularly good day  or good week  or God forbid a good month  utter crom s name and overcome his devils. to prove youre worthy of the only blessing he ever gave man
@alexander rahl  crom gave man the strength they needed to slay their enemies when they were born.  what else need a God do   if you cannot prove youre worthy with your own actions and need to call upon your Gods to do so  then you are not worthy.
@paul miller  strength to overcome  what more could a man ask of a God
rofl
wrong!
@seraphimroad  well it cant be a fleet horse  falcons at your wrist or wind in your hair  either.
hahahaha. and they would give him a man bun too and a dress!
wasn t there a conan movie in 2011 with jason momoa wich was allright if not forgetable. as in you watch it with a few friends  a couple of beers and forget it when you turn off the tv.
@khululy p  there was but it was kinda bad.  it really had nothing to do with conan other than the character being called conan.  the problem is momoa is a great guy  and has a great look  nothing bad to say about him as a person.... but he cant act.  especially not with a weak script.
@karkarov  I am very unfamiliar with conan lore I just treated it as a generic fantasy action flick at the time I watched.
@khululy p  yeah that is the best way to watch it  because that is pretty much what it is.
@karkarov  to be frank  the arnold movie had little if nothing to do with conan other than the main character being called conan as well.  dont get me wrong  I love the original movie  but if you think that that character is anything even remotely similar to conan than you could not possible be more wrong.  for all of her talk about modern movies using  origin stories  to just change the actual lore and background of a character that is exactly what the 1982 movie did.  they changed the background and story for valeria and even used the ending of queen of the black coast  which has belit coming back from the dead to blind the creature conan is fighting in order to save his life  and have valeria do that exact same thing.  for all of the complaints of what  modern  hollywood is doing  news flash  they ve been doing it for a very long time.  hell even the whole idea of thulsa doom  a character from the kull story delcardes cat  being the main villain in that movie despite existing in the thurian age and not the hyborian age  you know  many thousands of years prior to the time of conan  and having a skull for a face yet in this movie having a normal human face while being able to morph into a snake...then again in the kull movie they have him up against akivasha who didn t even exist in the thurian age  she was however in the hyborian age as she was in a conan story .
@paul miller  lol I didn t mention the arnold movies on any level.  so not sure where all this is coming from.  meanwhile  the arnold movies definitely were not 100  faithful to the original books  but they took many aspects of them and used them just differently.  valeria did exist in conan stories.  the cult of set was there.  so was fulsa doom though he was not really the same person.the momoa movie is not conan on any level.  it is just a action fantasy movie they used conan s name to market.
I want amazon prime to write  produce  cast  and film a new conan the barbarian show  said nobody ever.
hey melonie for always bringing all these interesting topics udiscuss on your fabulous channel
that blue hair comment had me in tears in the middle of work laughing too much to perform well for the day.
Im afraid of conan becoming public domain in 2028. I really am. with how so many properties have been bastardized I just know conan  one of my favorites will be treated like shit. conan and the shadow are two properties Im like  they must stay pure
conan was far from mindless and he was a savage with a code of honor. loved the stories the old comics weren t bad either.
awesome video  Im so glad this happened because imo to all the movie directors out there please dont make conan movie again   unless one is brave enough    well stick with the comics we wont complain. let it be a heritage to whisper his name  and his story of high adventure be told from a wise father to hI son when he reach a certain age of adulthood who will need motivation and encouragement to survive   learn to respect  honor and carry on in this world. in this day and age it is not meant for everyone anymore only the selected few may carry on this heritage  which I pray is more than enough.
the uncharted games amy henning wrote those 4 games and the male characters and the female characters are fantastic she did an amazing job.
arnold was the best when he played conan  you cant replace that movie with anything in the world  not even the new movies that came after with new actors didn t come close  they were good  but as good as arnold played. even the main soundtrack was awesome.
the only way to do conan properly is to release each episode in the order howard wrote the short stories  as though told to a chronicler by the aging king himself. unexpurgated  unaltered  unsullied.
oh but she was all willing to do a red sonja tv series. apparently she had no problems with big red chopping up a bunch of men. she also killed off edge which is basically conan in the wild west
conan what is best in life   woo..boy...not sure what s safe to say here...uh...respect all women....and men...or whoever identifies as whatever....uh....
hImelonie  just wanted to say thanks. its hard enough to find good woman these days and we men are getting pretty much run over. just shocked at how absolutely gorgeous you are and intelligent not to mention a fireball. you are the perfect example of the triple threat. you are a rare woman in these times.  I truly wish you much love  happiness  and success. keep up the great content. many blessings and praise the Lord and creator
in the  man bad  world she-hulk  conan  its kind of funny that they had an ip that cant be  wokified  or it wouldn t make much sense  so they abandon it and wont use the ip.the execs   lets find something else thats easier to      up its impossible for them to create a show that captures the got audience because there s no way they can make a good show that has woke attributes that appeals to that many people. and wow I died laughing when youread thatshe made the replacement show more female centric to  guard  from toxic masculinity. what kind of insane priorities are these amazon s about to learn some seriously expensive lessons. these deI people have no clue how to create art that makes money while capturing imaginations without ruining the core material and concepts. truly terrible hiring and decision making going on  with huge budgets. what a disaster.
we ll always have the arnie classics. go and listen to or read the original howard stories  they re fantastic  even if a bit funny in places by modern standards . so amazon isn t doing this one  no big loss. the toxic masculinity thing is a bitsilly but I think if they thought they could sell it they would have made it.
awesome  video... its great to see this analysis since anytime a man says something now  its problem.  I dont get crazy over this because I dont think most women are buying into the woke narratives either.  for most of the planet  women like men to be men  just like men like women to be women.  genders are different and respecting the differences is what we need to do.  certainly most stories should able to be told in that framework without being  toxic  from a male or female p.o.v..  it really isn t not that hard.
thank you for channel and having courage to speak on this.
conan the barbarian is a masterpiece they will never make a movie like it ever again.
conan was only done justice once ever and that was the original movie with swarzeneger and the basil polodoris score.is there anyone out there who can show us once again on screen what is best in life !
my all time favorite conan battle was when at the age of just 17 years old  he was hunted down and cornered in the mountains by a three-man team of assassins called  brotherhood of the falcon . these guys had him surrounded with his back to the wall when one on them told him  once we kill you and cash your head in for bounty  we will hire a wench to sing at your funeral . conan rose his sword and told them  the only song you will sing today is your own death song at the gates of hell. call out to whatever worthless God you pray to because Im about to send all three of you to him .  from there he lunged out in a mindless rage and killed two of them. the third assasin lunged at him and conan slipped and fell. before he could regain his balance this assasin swung his sword at him but was attacked himself by a snow beast that quickly  grabbed him and ripped him to pieces.
ironically robert e howard saw civilization heading this way and many of his conan stories were direct responses to it.
@karkarov  ah  you said conan and I assumed you meant the 1982 movie.  I tend to forget that other one s existence  purposefully  so I apologize for the confusion on my end.  yes  valeria did exist in the story red nails  however the valeria in red nails and the valeria in that movie shared a name and nothing else.  thulsa doom existed in delcardes cat which is a kull story which takes place in valusia in the thurian age  many thousands of year prior to the hyborian age.  and again  aside from the name  there really is no similarity to the characters.  as for the cult of set  there is a slight bit more similarity though set worship was mainly in stygia and neighboring nations and in that movie they went to zamora...where they certainly did not worship set.  so yeah... they got that completely wrong as well.  so in all honesty  neither movie is conan if you actually compare them to the source materials.
yup. conan initially wasn t  educated   but he was extremely intelligent in his own right.

the open steppe  a fleet horse  falcons at your wrist  and the wind in your hair
rofl.you called it  the answer to that question alone would make a writers room of offense experts heads explode.
just the music   arnie makes it.
hollywood has not made an original massively big action movie since possibly the 90s and the 80s both full of awesome movies. all they do now is try to do remakes or sequels.
of course they will.
arnold is the only live action conan I need
I doubt they cancelled it due to  toxic masculinity  look at how bad ass reacher is. if I had to guess  they thought rings of power was going to be massively successful  and their pitch for conan would of been similar  but rop is doing so poorly  they dropped it all together because  if one fantasy series is doing poorly  this fantasy series will probably do poor
melonie you have a great point with the new  origin  stories  they do want to change what they dont like. I will look at new origin adaptations differently now
I like how people already forgot amazon s attempt at wheel of time.
thats a relief.  I dont think I could bear to see conan given the rings of power treatment.
if there ever is another conan movie  I hope to God its john milius s king conan directed by either mel gibson  robert eggers  david lowery  or david michod
its a sad indication of how far hollywood has fallen that the best news we can get about an old  treasured franchise now is that they are not going to use it!
I own early copies of all the conan books  along with all the pastiche novels - something around 55 books - and enjoyed most of them.  despite what some people might assume  there s a lot of good writing in the series  with famous authors like robert jordan penning several   and the books are always entertaining.  conan is a very specific kind of character  however  and if you cant capture that  alongside a faithful presentation of the world he lives in  then you might as well not bother.there are several strong women in the conan universe but that would never be enough for feminists and they d be taking conan to the woodshed for his misogyny  constantly.
toxic masculinity - reeeeee!!!!!toxic femininity - yasss queen heres all the moneys!
having them not make a series  is the best outcome.    while conan is masculine he   his stories are far deeper than most modern ppl make him out to be.
have youread robert jordan s the wheel of time   it is really good  if a tad long   one of personal favorite books of all time.  too bad the show couldn t live up to it.
I think it might be a matter of overcrowding  rather than misandry. after all  amazon s got reacher and the terminal list going on  so it might not be the best timing to add another musclebound fellow to the mix.
you could make a conan series with red sonja thatshould make everybody happy  as long as they try to keep it true to the source material.
lol her fantasies went away   thank you for standing up for men
robert e howard is my favourite author so this makes me happy. I dont trust any of the modern studios to do conan properly. recommend that people read the original short stories if they haven t already  and also to check out some of his other characters like kull  solomon kane and el borak
I had no idea this was in the works. so happy to see it coming to netflix. rings of power is not good and the wheel of time had so much potential and just pissed it away. I really enjoyed the witcher netflix adaptation and look forward what else they have coming.
makes sense. conan is pretty much the polaric opposite of  the message!
ok so if watching conan makes you a bad man imagine the people who had saw the jeffrey dahmer documentary.
if I had a nickel for every time a woman saw some art of conan and thought  eww  toxic and gross ...I d have a suspicious lack of nickels...
its a problematic character and theme for modern production  and I dont think anyone could write it well without changing it too much. he would have to kill a lot of folks too and hear the lamentations of their significant others.
I love a good backstory as much as the next guy.  but melonie does make a very good point  that its become this vehicle for rewriting characters from the ground up.  honestly I think part of the appeal of conan is that cimmeria and thus conan s origins are so mysterious.  conan is the only example of his people we ever see in howard s writings.  all we really know about them is that they re a fierce warrior people who ve never been conquered  they excel at climbing and that they worship a very grim pantheon of Gods.  conan is a drifter who has somehow found his way to civilized lands and fallen in with thieves  mercenaries or bandits depending on the story.  really thats all we need to know about him.
yes  it is a great point which could have been make...40 years ago.  as in literally 40 years ago when exactly that was done in 1982 with the conan movie.  they created a whole new  origin  story for the exactly reasons she described.  this is nothing new.  this is no new  agenda .  this has been going on for longer than melonie has been alive  at least my assumption based on how she looks .  so if you haven t figured this out in  at the very least  the last 40 years.... why bother looking at things differently now
@paul miller  because people change their minds when they receive information. very dumb to think just because peoppe werent born 40 years ago or didn t have knowledge of something when they were 2 years old them they cant change their minds.
@Jesus mercedes  it is also pretty dumb to think that just because someone pointed out a practice which is many decades old and calling it new on a video based on an article whose very title is filled with propaganda and loaded language to push a narrative of unverifiable garbage as a solid reason to change ones mind about how they view everything.  perhaps it would be more logical to look at the facts and learn some history before claiming that things are  very dumb  because they were inconvenient to you.  she started this video by pulling up a biased propaganda article and based the video on that  which is pretty sad to be honest.  but by all means  let the propaganda  change your mind .
thats not true  and you know it. these people might shout all their love for these new projects  but they definitely dont watch them. so really all they actually offer is a cheer and then nothing.
are you happy that they are f... this up at netflix   and yes robert e. howard is my favourite author too.
you guys have good taste. I only knew conan from film and comics. read some robert e howard recently and went totally into the zone and flow. what a great writer he was.
@fing book  I have been reading conan books since the late 80s and only 15 years ago since the reprints I was able to get my hands on the original robert e. howard stories in english. but I have a question  have you found robert e. howard through midnight s edge or razorfist
@fing book  yup  he indeed was ! one of the very best sword   sorcery authors ever !
same and same.
they may swoon  but as a kid when I saw a picture of sword  n sorcery art  I d go   this is gonna be good. unfortunately most 80s sword  n sorcery movies were not good  but years later I found out how hilariously entertaining they were!
@peter janssen  dude  I thought the same of that trailer as a kid  Imean his sword had 3 blades!  I loved that ridiculously stupid ass sword!  even now I still laugh when I remember how anti-climactical it was when they showed how he came to own it...
@craig graham  ah! well  thats the movie the sword and the sorcerer. which is hilarious . albert puyn s finest moment.  then there was the first cyborg movie and all the snu-snu sequels but Imeant the genre of  sword  n sorcery   of which sword and the sorcerer is just a tiny fraction.
and if you thought sword and the sorcerer was kitsch  wait   till you check deathstalker I  iI and iiI  or the deathstalker movies  barbarian queen and lucio fulcI s conquest. what a blast!
owh  and wizards of the lost kingdom 1   2   both you can find on youtbue.
aww yea  never heard of those... homework!
@craig graham  homework is boring. b-movies should be a playground worth exploring. only nerds  dweeps  geeks  n dorks make such things a matter or hierarchy.
I watch very little modern television movies. this is a reminder why. makes it very easy to catch up on a backlog of films and television from an era that isn t looking to be offended by something.
melonie looks just like the female character on  the cimmerian  iron shadows in the moon  art at 9 40 of this video.  thats your cosplay outfit for halloween this year  melonie!
conan already had an origin story. he watched his mom beheaded and his village slaughtered. he then contemplated the riddle of steel and determined its the love behind the steel that provides the strength.
mongol general   what is best in life  conan   to crush your enemies  to see them driven before you  and to hear the lamentations of their women.
like star wars -- and Lord of the rings -- conan could never be recreated because its certain innocence. its not just the character  rather his or her era.
conan is archetypal masculinity
I hope that we can all look back on this many years from now and see how completely idiotic this all is. Im so gawdamn sick of everything trying to be  woke  now. its exhausting. thank you melonie for covering this media. how are you not going crazy
keep up the great work on your channel  keep hustling
I wish someone would make a conan movie or series that is true to the original authers vision.
this is a blessing. I dont want amazon to touch any sword and sorcery genre. especially since Im quite sure no one on the writing team read any of howard s work. I think for now  conan should stick to comics and tabletop games.
when st tng left the tv and went to feature films  I would ve given anything for it to come back. now with st picard  I would give anything for season 3 not to happen!
I love how amazon handed their talent to hbo. lmao. george r.r. martin convinced hbo to take the one of the developers of the conan script and he is working on the house of dragons  which is killing amazon s rings of  prime .
conan the barbarian was a classic manly man s movie.  a prehistoric pre-lotr adventure
this day in age if you as a man are being called toxic or told you have  toxic masculinity  then youre probably doing something right. wear that badge with pride.
I hope someone makes a decent conan show. but yeah Im glad they re not going to ruin conan.
conan has never been done right by hollywood  the closest we got was an pilot for an adult swim parody called  korgoth of barbaria  and the network executives didn t get it and passed on.
technically the entire marvel universe is cannon within conan. and there have been crossovers for some reason and the pictures I have seen are comedy gold. like ghost rider riding a giant flaming spider guard against an army
hopefully not a blue haired woman
I remember reading the old conan comics because my older brother had a few of them. they were often rough and violent on the outside  but also had touching  deeper moments if you cared to read through a story ark.the mmo that was released back around 2011 also was a small  altough short lived highlight for me. the game had one of the best  most immersive starting areas with great story telling  characters and an overall enjoyable combat system. its just a shame that the game went downhill from there because funcom  the developer  had the genius idea to distribute their resources across 3 different games which all turned out mediocre at best  instead of making 1 decent game.with that in mind  maybe its better that companies like amazon and netflix leave conan alone  but I d love to see a fan made film or short series.
I have read all of robert e howards conan stories. Im wondering where the toxic masculinity is in those stories...I just remember great characters  male and female who lived life to the full. I think if anything howards conan is too complex a character to be given justice on screen  especially now.
same...I have given up on modern film tv.....if it ain t old I dont watch it
I agree. me and my friends only watch shit from 20 years ago   anime   mostly because anime is untouched by modern politics. its all about fun  . Im black and I cant stand the amount of woke shit being shoved down our throats in western entertainment.
the number of dvd bluray Ive been buying lately is stellar! and I had so much already. I dont watch any tv streaming.....f off!
ace ventura culd never be filmed today.
very good advice!
same here. most movies and shows in general do not catch my interest anyways  but then you also have the badly written political stuff that usually is just about bad diversity representation  or worse  its a show or movie that hates me for being male  but blames me for if I dont watch their show anyways. I simply would rather watch videos about how bad said show is.
nope.  thats his first re-imagined origin story.  his original one is only referred to here and there  and usually only in supporting texts rather than story content  and never written out as a story.
its not being  woke.   its being anti-inclusive. being woke is a good thing. people dont know what the word means anymore.
you nailed it! my favorite aspect of the first movie is the way it embraced robert e. howard s bleak world view where nothing could be taken for granted   rewards had to be earned.
daniel sweet. exactly! it may not have been accurate to conan the character honestly  he acts more like kull.  it perfectly copies the setting and tone howard wrote.
@abrahem samander  well it certainly was not accurate to conan s character from the howard stories.  but it was even further from kull who was far more of an intellectual and fascinated with things like philosophy which conan could never tolerate.  the character that arnold portrayed in the movie was just a character made for the movie who happened to share the name conan...thats about it.  the only other similarities they share are the facts that they come from cimmeria and they worship crom.  that is literally all they share in common.  the similarities between that character and kull.... they are both men
ps  even back in 2011 there was a controversy surrounding the finishing moves in the game  you could decapitate some enemies  although the game was clearly marketed as 18  lol.
age of conan was a great game  and if you haven t seen it yet youreally aught to try out conan exiles  also made by funcom  who own the conan ip now .
imma call it now.1st episode   conon gets captured 2nd episode  magically has daughter 3rd episode  conania goes on adventures to save father.4th ep  beats all the people that beat her dad.
amazon scraps doing conan .... every real fan breathes a sigh of relief
I dont get how this could be abandoned. cobra kaI remains on top of the neilsen streaming list.
instead of a  power fantasy   conan stories follow  the heroes  journey  rather closely  think do i.  power fantasies are completely different  there the protagonist tends to only grow in power  yet shies toward a marty stu  feel do i.  that is  they tend to be bereft an inner conflict.  their outer conflict is really weak   they never fail at anything.
amazon doesnt understand fantasy because they never read the books nor understand the tone the writer is using as part of their theme. tolkien s writing has lots of poetry  beauty  and humor. robert e howard is short concise and brutal in his first story conan is eating a giant feast like a barbarian gets attacked by a shadow monster which he kills with a magic sword. hp lovecraft horror centered around horror and helplessness against forces greater than mankind.
the current state of movies and tv has me horrified of news of adaptations
Im pretty sure that conan rights went to netflix and heard they are doing the series. if Im not mistaken if someone knows more please let me know
conan dodged a bullet there. Im not even going to imagine what they would have done to him.
I remember arnold before he said  screw your freedom!  Imiss that guy.
its going to be hilarious when wheel of time floops and conan is a hit on netflix.
2011  there s a new conan showaudience  yay!!2022  the planned conan show is canceledaudience  yay!!
we will always have the howard novels and the arnold conan movies. they can never take those away from us.
I just want arnie to come back for a king conan before he passes  we deserve the final chapter of conan the barbarian  no longer the barbarian  but a wizened diplomate.
if being a strong man who defends those who are not capable of defending themselves is toxic then Im toxic as hell!
its so funny. if somebody who never read a conan story heard they were planning an origin story  they would assume thats plausible but he s a character thats better the less you know about him. unlike characters like spider-man  superman or batman he isn t deeply rooted in his origin story. his adventures are adventures and thats that.
holy shit im so glad they arent going to ruin conan too lmao
these clowns couldn t adapt any fantasy story to save their lives  let alone the conan the barbarian. writing and adapting fantasy requires the basic acknowledgment that  no matter the level of resemblance  fantasy is not the real world  something people running these projects either can only rarely do or are only rarely allowed to do.
as a conan and sword sorcery fan  Im kinda relieved. that is also kinda weird.
amazon really may be rethinking this now. reacher and terminal list both did great with alpha male leads. unless of course  the message  is more important than money.
seeing what amazon did to Lord of the rings then this is doing us a favor
and howard wrote great story driven poetry as well and lets not forget  eldritch beings  exist in the conan cimmerian age setting.
that is sadly very true. aya brea  tifa  ripley  samus were all characters I adore to this day  because their stories and personalities are authentic  yet they always stood within the restraints of their own world  which I think was what made them believable.
arnold was perfect as conan  the first movie was perfection in terms of creating the conan world for the big screen. cant imagine who could fill the role today physically  maybe john cena or dave bautista... but it never will be the real thing again  cause of  the message
given how crappy most of amazon s stuff is these days  them canceling the series is a boon.  with any luck  maybe somebody competent will get the rights to conan and make it instead  especially if its a few years in the future when some of the nuttiness hopefully has been beaten back.
this is good news.  amazon would have rebooted conan as a half-asian half-african  trans dwarf with obesity... who somehow wields a massive blade and kills 200lb  warriors.  I prefer arnie.
no show is better than a bad one. also  reacher is awesome  rewatch that.
love it or leave it  better to be remembered as the king.
very well said and you just got a sub.
I think women can write for males but it would always be from the perspective of a women and men can usually always tell. off topic your hair is great I love it
a few words about the  conan aka robert e.howard  community and fredirik mahlberg.back in 2006 the conan properties wre handed over to the swedish company funcom who then produced pretty awsome pc games -  age of conan and conan exiles. funcom also promised to be rather relaxed with licensing and they stood true to their word. itshould also be noted that funcom both enjoys the conan universe as well as they make no compromise.I could suspect that amazon had rather shitty plans for conan and mahlberg canceled that and moved to netflix who are more open to let people do what they wanna do. in addition to that the robert e.howard community is pretty much forgiving  sure we always point out whats wrong about robert e.howard movie adaptation but then again we are glad they exist - with the exception of  red sonja . just for those not knowing let me some up movies based on robert e.howard creations pigions from hell  1961  - an episode in the boris karloff hosted tv show thrillerthe whole wide world  1996  - a bio pic starring vincent d onofrio as robert e.howardconan the barbarian  1982  - well knownconan the destroyer  1984  - as roy thomas said in 2006  thats not what I wrote. red sonja  1985  - sadly all those idiots sticked to the shitty film version of red sonja while she actually is more like a female musketeerkull  1997  - .... well  its a moviesolomon kane  2009  - not much of the original character but still a great filmconan the adventurer tv  1997-98  - sure as hell some typical tv fantasy show but actually in some regard not to far off the original characterconan  2011  - to bad they had to waste time with childhood conandespite what a lot of poeple might think  because r.e.howards creations are now regarded as fantasy standards  howard himself was way ahead of its time. not only was he most likely the first to create powrful female heroes like - the original - red sonja or black agnes but he always made them equal and respected by male characters. the queen of the black coast would wash some galadriel away like a fly. and conan had been more complex they 98  of all super heroes because .... he was not a hero. he just lived his life and did what he had to do to survive but one thing always was paramount in his creed - the human life.conan would not think twice to throw away the most valuable gem in the world to save a simple girl. - tower of the elephant.Im curious to see what they ll do with conan at netflix. could be nice actually.
I honestly wish these people would just leave conan alone  I have zero confidence they cantruthfully adapt him in this era hypersensitive and woke bs. but I hope they prove me wrong because Im a big conan fan and that fantasy genre
I just discovered your site.  great.  what is wrong with these media corporations and their weird ideas   if men are toxic why go after characters like conan   just hire woody allen to write it   I think he s pretty available.
the thing is that the works of howards are  not just power male fantasy. the works of howard are more like the story of a man and its influence in the world through the course of his life. it has soooo much depth and beauty and his extremely well written.  conan is a remarquable man for tons of better reasons than his physique. anyways  I just hope that its gonna be based on the howard stories rather than the shitty marvel and pretty much every comics they made of him.  Imean if you decide to read conan melonie  you ll love belit and valeria who are such strong women characters.  howards conan is definitely gonna pass for toxic masculinity even though its totally not the case. such a shame really.
I liked the original conan the barbarian film  and the books from robert e howard.
I used to really look forward to my favorite franchises being made today  we re at point that cgI has come so far and filming in general to be able to make a badass movie or show but now I dont want them touching it cause they re somehow going to try to beat you over the head with some kind of lesson or and swap characters out. they were trying to redo red sonja and cast a black woman as sonja which is ridiculous finally they swapped it back but blamed racism of course I wonder if its cause they re trying to diversify or create a buzz to make a point that the old r word is alive and well and we re in the jim crow days or both. yeah I really dont look forward to most movies based on properties.new movies fresh content not based on anything else is fair game but when your messing with characters people already know and love dont!
this is great news!
I really think the whole rings of power fiasco had a strong impact in this decision.tolkien fans showed they can fight back and wont gonna keep quiet about it like good little boys. youtubers like you are speaking the truth  so we wont be deceived by the woke media and its shitty narratives anymore.amazon keeps embarassing itself more and more. money aside  this disaster really harmed their reputation with the consumers. I dont think they re touching a rpg series again anytime soon.
I love conan. this is nothing other than a good thing as far as Im concerned. I dont want people who hate conan  making conan material. arnie actually liked conan and his movie set conan into a cultural corner of  big dumb guy swings sword.  for decades and only now are some people starting to get into conan and realize  holy shit thats nothing like how conan was at all.  so good. only people who like conan and will do it right should touch the material
masculinity isn t toxic. its what makes us run into a burning building to save a stranger.
the first conan movie already showed his origins didn t it
the groups they are catering to aren t even the groups that purchase support their products.  these catered to groups just want to make sure to crap all over the actual product so the target audience cant enjoy it.
they would do to conan like what they did to he-man .
if it was not conan and more of a parody I would find the idea hilarious
coma am the wokebarian
which is actually funny because for once race swapping might have actually not have been an insult to the creator s work. hyperboria is england according to howard  but in every story he s described as anything but proto-english tribes depending on how howard felt that day.
I dunno . . . Imight actually pay money just for a sneak peek at such an atrocity purely out of curiosity on how they will carry it out. never underestimate the power of hollywood fan-baiting.
@pet boy  they wont  because they wont make any money if they did that
@pet boy  thats already a thing dingleberry  her name is red sonya
@pet boy   with his soy .. playing with his toy..
@kurosh moshfegh  I said turned conan into a woman ding dong. red sonja is a different character. I want to see the people complaining cry more.
you are worrying too much. cause ae e ey per they would be a pacifist  that like to obey the leading strong femal protagonist s command and drink tea with wyrs little finger pointed at the sky.
@             its cute that you still believe any of this is about money.
@michael howze  eventually it will be about money.
conan as a half-asian half-african  so the rock
@paul miller  Im fine with that  as long as they do the  to crush your enemies. see them driven before you. and to hear the lamentations of their women  line
generally agree with everything.  except human life as conan s creed.  I dont think you can be a reaver and slayer and say you value human life.  its more nuanced than that.  I think his central creed is honor.  you treat people honorably - you save them honorably  you kill them honorably  youre free to doublecross them if they aren t honorable themselves  or to survive  but even then he would ally with them against a common foe.  maybe its the consequence of the times.  life is cheap in the hyborian age  but its not worthless.
@brian smith  understand your point and guess its something inbetween. didn t meant he is a humanist  surly not but being a thief and honor may have a hard time together.   like I said  he did what he had to do and sometime he had nothing better to do because  life is cheap in the hyborian age  but its not worthless. really curious to see what happens at netflix and despite the fact they make  red sonja  and fantasy flic again it could get nice since they got the director of solomon kane for the project now. we ll see.
Ive just started reading some original conan stories by howard. it would make some people s heads explode today.
apparently there is usually in contract an obligation of some kind for it to be true to the character. like marvels recent run. they had no choice but to write it normally and couldnt change it.
well I have the exact same sentiment  but I was told the netlifx in production show  I know  I know  is actually good. check midnight s edge content on conan. as an example  amazon studios is awful  but reacher had a great first season.
I hope they can prove me wrong . lol having hope about adaptations in 2022  just walk away dude. you ll feel less pain when you walk away.
@lark88  right ! that dude was hard core  did not mince words  and didn t give a shit about someone s tender little feelings.
netflix will prove you right. I hope that they will drop this project as to male toxic  like amazon did.
dude wheel of time fans did the same thing  amazon only cares about the numbers.  considering I still have rings of power shoved in my face every time I open their website I think the numbers are probably fine in their opinion.
they made the decision more than 2 years ago  had nothing to do with rings of power.
Ive read robert e. howard s conan and he was a brilliant storyteller but a lot of it doesnt seem like it d be allowed given modern sensibility. I would love a show based on howard s writing but I dont see how that d ever be made right now.
conan was never a mindless savage. he became king because he is cunning. he was a barbarian  a thief  a mage slayer. those fragile egotists cannot seem to understand great warriors are also smart  not only strong. and they are so arrogant they never read the source material to get it.
I remember a time when only men got tattoos. those were the good days.
crush your enemies  see them driven before you  and to hear the lamentation of their women!
notice how they say they want to dominate the market  not out-compete it.  they always say exactly what they mean.
Im actually glad about this. amazon would have ruined it.
the thing that probably made them the most mad was the theme of  man saves woman from bad guy . removing that from culture is going to have a horrible effect on kids that will be growing up during this time and turning into adults in about 20 years
dude this is awesome news!
conan from what I remember simply  left his home of cimmeria because he got a case of  wondering foot  a desire to just travel about and see what the world has to offer.that aside so this person took one look at the work and rightings of someone they wouldn t even be qualified to shine the shoes of and decided they didn t like the work that has endured nearly a full century of reading and scrutiny by countless readers the world over and simply said  this is toxic .well I ll go with  envy  for 500
flight of phoenix I saw the old version on day time tv and was awesome. so happy saw before the remake
conan steps forward to confront the blood thirsty raiders and bellows   greetings gentlemen - let us discuss our feelings over tea and crumpets!
jeff conan the potential to crash harder than rings of power...
they made fans happy with reacher and terminal list  and would have put even more people front of their prime subscription.  the message  is that important to them.
what is weird is that bezos is a numbers man  and seems to focus amazon culture in number management.if 20  of young people were woke  a big if   these tactics would result in losing 4  old fashioned  people for each  woke  it attracts.but the numbers have said time and again the most woke people that could watch the show then ignore it because they were never interested on the base premise  even adapted .and the fans who were interested then get disappointed and mass leave the shows.makes me wonder how the boys and reacher are controlled inside amazon vs these other shows.
ablaze cimmerian is really good recommend those hc if anyone wants to get them  they are the uncensored conan the barbarian intended by lee
best news coming out of hollywood lately.
oh thank crom. in some weird way I think he actually cares about this one.
I remember at a government job I had in the 90 s there was quotas for management positions in gender and race. if a woman was promoted or left  then you knew a woman would get her old job. it doesnt sound too different today except they are removing white straight males to replace with anyone else on purpose. thats not equality  thats genderism and racist. I believe you hire the person who will do the job the best no matter their race  sex  or sexual preference. thanks for speaking the truth.
putting aside the amusing concept that a company named  amazon  hates masculinity  Im rather glad that they didn t get the opportunity to destroy yet another legacy character.
hey  conan the adventurer was a perfectly fun cartoon! lol
what made him also specially is the way he wrote it  it was direct  raw and brought it to the point. for fans of robert e. howard  he was gifted for heroic storytelling and died to early to write even more fantastic  heroic and weird tales.
agreed on both counts.
I have a 2 yo son and I frequently apologize to him for bringing him into such a fucked up world and how bad his life will probably be.
we re already living in a world where a lot of people have no concept of saving anyone from anybody.  they have no sense of moral duty to help anyone but themselves.  this  of course  serves the corporate overLords well.
you know if never noticed that before  good catch.
I have an idea for amazon  all they have to do is make conana the barbarianess with exactly the same plot then it will magically no longer be toxic.
when what s his name tried to hijack star trek because he wanted his version of capt kirk to sell merch  thats when I knew what it was.
at least we have gendy tartakovskI s primal  which has some inspiration and references to conan- same with samuraI jack.
we re in the matrix  its all a game  a thought experiment.  -erin valentI  utah tech ceo with no history of mental illness  found dead in backseat of own california rental car  days after going missing calling her parents   ------ 33yrs old  2019 october     she was researching computer-brain interface systems
arnold is supposed to be starring in a new conan movie soon. itsounds awesome. he s an aged king who uses brutality  fear  and intimidation to keep his thrown. its meant to be the final chapter in what will be a conan trilogy and its gonna be a testosterone fueled gore fest. I thought they scrapped it but apparently its still a go.
amazon  we will not be doing a connan series.me  thank you
the kid who starred in thatsamson movie a few years back would make a good conan  do a youtube search for  samson kills a 1000 philistines  .  he s a dead ringer for a storyboard that neal adams drew years ago...
so they admitted it.  they made rings of power for children but made it dumber than even the simplest of children would need to understand it.  corporate production at its finest.
a man created lara croft  and a woman created uncharted.and both are great stories.
we already had a conan show starring rolf moeller
let s be fair here   conan had one good movie  two bad ones  an okay cartoon series  a bad tv series  and one good soundtrack.moreover  they had about 89 clones  the best of which was the sword and the sorcerer.amazon isn t afraid of  toxic masculinity   they re afraid of testosterone.
give me food  so I have strength when the wolves come. let me die  not in hunger  but in combat!
male power fantasy  is an interesting one - mostly because people miss what the actual fantasy is. detractors see nothing but a hyper-alpha with muscles on muscles  and woman throwing themselves at him and think that must be what men want. in reality  thats just a perk . the actual fantasy is  conan  reacher  and any other character that fits this mold  do what most men want to do - they call bullshit when they see it  they beat up bullies  they have the courage to do the right thing!thats what many men want - courage.
absolutely nailed it!
Im sure the show will be released eventually  but conan will be played by a kick-ass woman who will slay every toxic man she fights.
fuck  nowadays I feel dread each time I hear any franchise universe setting videogame I like is getting a movie series sequel reboot or remake.
arnold schwarzenegger s conan in answer to the question  what is best in life   - to crush your enemies. see them driven before you. and to hear the lamentations of their women.  we cant have that these days now can we
was shocked to see you in my feed. remember watching you years ago for the video game vids. Im guessing its been a year or two since I last seen you.
my fav part is that amazon salke  fired condal from conan  who went and got hired at hbo  and now produces house of the dragon which appears to have beaten out the ring-o-power-amazon-paint-by-numbers showironic  like poetry
mary shelley created frankenstein  thats one of the most iconic fictional male figures made by a woman I could think of
arnold went woke  this movie will suck
arnold s conan wasn t real conan either.at least it wasn t woke though.
king conan!!!! fingers crossed.
I heard about the new conan with arnie  back in 2007. but yeah and as for him going woke he was always a rino and had a soft spot for lefty sjwism so I was  not surprised when he actively started to disgrace right leaning people. it came as shock to other conservatives but I saw it coming.
@des payre   fingers crossed   Christ almighty are you just not paying attention  the only thing you should be hoping for is that the project gets cancelled before it gets off the ground.
they ve been saying their going to do king conan for over 10 years. if cameras aren t rolling in the next two years it wont happen. arnold is 75 now.
@paul schmick  definitely right....now or never!
the movies had very little to do with actual re howard s conan.
I actually thought the jason mamoa version was pretty faithful to the robert howard vision. not that faithful makes it better  necessarily  but I thought they did a fair job. the arnold version was iconic  but he has a bit of a humorous appeal that I never saw in conan. though it made that conan a bit more accessible  which is good.
it had good stories books first and tons of great comics!!!
two okay cartoon series
@warlok  you are absolutely correct  the original books are quite superior to any adaption ever made by the movie-industry.
which soundtrack  the movie or the mmo game
you forgot the first computer game  for the c64! the game was rather  meh  but the decapitation move was legendary!
I agree.  and the power in the power fantasy is having the ability to do the right thing  no matter the opposition.
@brian smith  the strength and the courage to do what is right. yeap
rip genghis khan
after what they ve done to lotr  ruining conan would be a sin of epic proportion. I think it may be a deadly sin.
imagine a woke conan... wow
conan cancelled because men not good enough.  fixed it.  Im available anytime for a constantly increasing price.
I wouldn t even call conan as male power fantasy  its just heroic dark fentesy which is men often are drawn to.
considering what Ive heard about what they did with Lord of the rings then great!!
I believe now that for the activist side of hollywood its more the fact that there is social capital to be gained in fantasy and scI fi. amazon can make reacher and the terminal list which are military espionage style shows which absolutely older male dominated genres that they will leave alone because they dont have the same cross demographic appeal thatscI fI and fantasy has. for the foreseeable future the activist class of production will keep burying its claws in the genres they believe will give them the most influence over younger audiences. there are weird pockets of hollywood that are allowed to exist and get made well with minimal  wokeness  think of something like better call saul which had almost universal praise from audiences and fans alike but got no emmy nominations and little in the way of engineered publicity. Ive given up on the genres that are infected for the time being and simply watch old stuff or am seeking out the smaller pool of content that is less affected.
honestly doesnt make sense really cuz when you actually look at the shows amazon has made where they lean in to the masculine and old school style action or mentality they ve been their most widely accepted shows. reacher  jack ryan  and terminal list are prime   no pun intended  examples
without robert e. howard the swords   sorcery genre wouldnt exist as it does today and wouldnt be as deep and rich. rumor has it that one night howard fell asleep at his type writer and woke after a dream to see this muscular figure standing before him. in that he started to write the tales of conan . robert e. howard is also responsible for kull the conquerer  red sonja and solomon kane. many writers have attributed their inspiration for other high fantasy stories to robert e. howard and his characters.conan is supposed to be extremely masculine and in some stories savage due in part to village being destroyed.  schwarzenneger is iconic but momoa did a great job as well portraying the character .  these days anymore people forget what masculinity actually is and see anything masculine as  toxic . robert e. howard would backflip in his grave if any of his characters in particular conan were altered. howard was passionate about the world of conan being savage where every fight was a fight for survival  where going into battle led to glory at the death of your enemies or falling in battle . in fact all of his characters share the same world they just live in different section of it. lastly all of the stories during the hyborian age have alot of racism as well however it works for the benefit of the stories whether its conan  kull etc. it gives a perspective into the minds of the savage lands and the peoples who inhabit the world strange nobody ever mentions the aspects of racism and only focus on the masculine side of things
and midnight s edge told the guy s pilot script was one of the best ever written for conan.amazon studios is a house of losers. just not whole losers because reacher had a pretty solid first season.
they tried to do the same thing with lobo  a much more obscure char to be sure  but alot like conan....only more violent. he once wore a belt buckle thatsaid beer guns wimmin. they made a few comics of him as a little skinny meta pussy and it went over like a turd in a punchbowl. he is back to normal now I believe. I hope they leave conan the hell alone.
origin story   we are going to update the story for modern audiences   we are putting ideology ahead of existing lore and a quality story.
thunk we hit max wokeness in the 80 s when everyone shared a coke and a smile
Ive read tons of fantasy novels and I can always pick out the ones written by women because they just dont get the fighting right  or they dont get how men relate to each other  or they dont put the emphasis where it needs to be because they re writing through a female lens.  how can you write about fighting when you ve never been punched   how can youreally understand concepts that are so alien to how you were raised   of course  we re seeing this failure in male writers  too  since so many of them have been raised soft  wearing padded helmets when they pedal their bicycles around the manicured parks  etc.
amazon could have made red sonja which was the female version of conan
red sonja will be good.  if I say it enough I believe it will be true.  I want another conan but not if these people are producing it.
well if it was canceled from amazon for being  toxic masculinity  then itsounds like they were probably on the right track for conan. it could still could end up being crap but at least amazon didn t ruin it with their influence.
its crazy that most women protagonist they create have  toxic masculinity  traits but do things like this. its painfully obvious amazon has hopped on the male hate gravy train and they also happen to be very hypocritical  I find thats the same deal with most tv outlets
the closest character to conan I canthink of is guts from berserk.  neither character is  toxic  in the least but incredibly masculine both.  these people seem to want men weak.  possibly to conquer
they will continue to make content nobody asked for until they collapse. there is an opportunity for smaller companies to make content people like  but right now they dont get funding because this activist content is being pushed from way up top  with blackrock and others.
amazon conan be like  conan  what is best in life   drinking soy milk  sitting down to pee and watching the 2016 ghostbusters remake.
right  reacher seems like an anomaly. strong competent man as the lead  capable female character who doesnt need to the men around her to look like fools so she can shine and she s still feminine and a love interest. black man with a personality and motivation beyond his skin color. its diverse but naturally so. how adaptations should be done  focus on quality and the rest falls into place
can you please transport me to the universe you live in where a modern red sonja has a chance of being good
@ka-ka-kannath  decent director  passable lead actress  good in revenge or at least you can see the potential   complete rewrite of the script  exclusion of gail simone  budget north of 70m... there s hope
I absolutely believe that red sonia could be awesome if they let people work on it who are passionate about the character and telling an interesting story  and not some daydreaming wokeoids who only care about their political agenda.
if I say it enough I believe it will be true well you only said it once soooooooo
at least they have replaced the actress with that looks more like the character.
@Lordoflek  budget doesnt mean shit in a world where you cantank a multi-billion franchise like star wars just to send a message. but I sincerely hope it ll be good for anyone who still has faith  I just dont believe it personally.
red sonja will be directed by trans director  although his her movie is not woke yet
you ask for bald flat red sonja
knowing hollywood loves swapping gingers to black character  yeah  I can see a bald black  red  sonja.
@Lordoflek  considering the director also did  solomon kane  and kept that as close to the source material as they could.  also howard. well... youre not wrong about being hopeful.and if I remember correctly  they were called in to  save  that movie as well  just as they were are with red sonja.using third person  because I dont recall their gender. think they were female  but not 100   so why run the risk of  yelling   when I can utilize the grammatical unknown gender option.
there s no such thing as toxic masculinity. men need to be as masculine as possible now more then ever
by crom ive been fearing the day I heard the words conan and amazon together but...again...conan prevails!!! will anyone ever get bob howards conan right        I did...and I do it with stop motion!! woman.....with the respect and honor youve shown this classic antI hero....I grant you my sub!!    . great job!
oh and fyI conan was never kicked out of cimmeria. he left of his own volition.
at only a minute in  I agree with that first twitter reply  I d rather it just be cancelled instead of being  updated for modern audiences   thanks.
if a creator calls conan  toxic masculinity  then they haven t read or know anything about conan. its better they leave it alone
they re going to do conan just like netflix did to he-man.
I didn t even know that they were going to make a conan tv show. but it would have been crap  or the actual main character would be a woman who is the key to everything. and she actually saves the day and conan would be a supporting charater. I remember liking the conan movies. some people dont realize that a man created wonder woman. and she s a beloved dc character by both men and women.if conan was done right I would like to see it. I wouldn t mind see a john carter of mars series. if it was done right. Im tired of the toxic masculinity phrase. great to see ya mel. thanks for keeping me informed.
conan is a property that could be a game of thrones like breakout.  but they will never do it correctly.  its a brutal dark fantasy world and it cant be allowed to be liked
I dont mind conan being cancelled  they would never make anything on par with the old movies and comics. what I would say tho is that amazon are winning  people dont have to watch the shows they make but nothing will stop them making them or buying them. its like when mr burns brought springfield s tv staton and put himself in every show  and with the streaming services counting the smallest amount of time as a view its the figures will always be in amazons favour.
better untouched than tarnished  3
if amazon made a conan show  he would have a female sidekick that was wayyyyy stronger and wayyyy smarter than him. he also would be constantly kidnapped and defeated  requiring her to save him of course.
right on the nose about origin stories.
maybe if gale ann hurd or kathryn bigelow touched this series we would see a potentially good conan.it may keep the woke temperature down.
awe  you missed the funniest part! house of the dragon is destroying rings of power  and amazon gave them the guy who s directing house of the dragon! oh  its so funny!
wheel of time  could have.. should have been awesome.. if they had actually adapted instead of just taking less than a handful very basic plot points and the names of characters and places and re-made it almost from scratch. heck  they even changed the magic system and the lore.
this is great news  I sure would not want a soy latte sipping conan trying to get in touch with his feelings.
I am relieved that they aren t making this. it would ve been an atrocious  woke nightmare with one of the most iconic  hypermasculine fantasy heroes being constantly put in his place by strong women. decades of amazing books and comics and the old arnie film adaptations will have to do  folks!
bezos  what is best in life   to conquer the other corporations....to see their subscriptions disappear before you....and the lamentation of the fans
stories by a woman staring a man  full metal alchemist stories written by a man staring a woman- terminator
oh thank God  amazon tainting conan is perfect hopefully one day we ll get normal people to give conan the adaptation he deserves.edit  apparently netflix picked up the series in 2020 so conan series is happening but Im still concerned  cyberpunk edgerunners was great as was arcane and castlevania but so far all of their live action adaptations of other ips have been pretty bad.
we police toxicity amongst ourselves pretty well  women however promote toxic behaviour more than anything else.
exactly  toxic men do exist  ie rapists  child abusers  etc  but it was always up to men to handle these situations. that got misinterpreted along the way by extremists and now they label everything masculine as toxic.
yes  well said tarlson

its always gonna be the women and children who suffer the most under male violence  thats a fact we cannot deny. but that is also the reason why it used to be  and still kinda is  the mens duty to protect their women and children.personally  as a westerner  I dont bother to be chivalrous anymore in my own country. if women want to claim oppression and be like men  they are welcome to do so. there are still plenty of other countries where male attributes are valued and respected.
I agree  men just need to be men  not worry about what the mob thinks if they have a strong moral compass.
there is  however  toxic emasculation.
@scormern  those would be criminals...nothing to do with masculinity.
@legend of fupa  was  past tense  for anyone promoting feminist lines especially.
@legend of fupa  not being chivalrous to anyone isn t the answer. dont let the toxic feminist ruin masculinity.
@linken08  its not like I gave up on it completely. I still help the elderly across the street  or when someone in front of me is short a buck at the cash register. but Im definitely more cautious who I help and under what circumstances. keep in mind there were cases when people who were trying to help got accused of terrible crimes and almost ended up in jail. the world is crazy.
@harry wilson  damn you beat me to it cheers friend
@kalesmart1  yes exactly
@legend of fupa  I dont think thats true. statistics would show that men suffer the worst under male violence. studies also show the most abusive relationships are often lesbian ones.
@scormern  spot on! well said! to the stygian depths with what sjw s think!
never existed. it was a catch phrase that fooled people into believing that there was a gender to toxic behavior. to be clear  toxic behavior exists in both gender  but the catch phrase was meant to diminish the qualities of men with the assumption that they should be more like women. men and women are different for a reason  and more people are realizing now  after some years  that they dont want men who buy into the idea of toxic masculinity because of how worthless they become to society and women. clearly  feminine toxicity has gone unchecked in the process  lol.
@scormern  toxic men and women.   toxicity   can be found throughout both sexes. something a lot of people forgot  along the way.
men need to be whatever they wanna be. whether that be an alpha male or a sissy. tired of society telling men what they need to be.
@harry wilson  -  exactly.  rapists and pedophiles aren t even men in my opinion.  masculinity has nothing to do with those things.
they cancelled this    awwwww  I was looking forward to  conan the vegetarian !
if netflix is doing it they ll screw it up too.
thank you for posting  this video .   thang God  .   conan the barbarian will remain safe.  you  have a new subscriber.   keep up the great work ..
in the movie  he loved his parents and girlfriendgrace jones saved destroyer!
sounds about right.
I think they need to give korgoth another chance seriously  look up the korgoth trailer on youtube  its hilarious.
my favourite part in the conan films was when studio execs ask him  what is good in life  and conan answers -  to honour the bechdel test! to name anyone who disagree s with me a bigot or racist! and to see my enemies silenced by the government!
I got this video on my feed the other day. first time viewer. I like that you dont change you voice or go reee  when youread. you just read it and comment. when other people do it  they kind of sound like the type of person  some might claim they are. I have a hard time explaining what Imean. you just got a new follower
anything by lovecraft  ashton smith  burroughs  howard and all the pulp fiction greats hard to be reproduced on film. its essence just cant be replicated live action. lambert s tarzan  carter of mars and arnold s conan came close. unlike krull movie - dear Lord  concept and imagry valiant attempt  but dear Lord  the casting .
this is sad. I have been reading conan books since middle school. I love the game. this could have been epic
the origin story is probably easier w.r.t producing the hero s journey. once a hero is already strong  there s not as much growth possible.
the guy who was going to make it  made house of dragons and set it against the rings of power. talk about a kill shot.
amazon s rings of power is a slap in the face of tolkien s fans.
they d screw it up anyway. conan is too subtle a character for them to pull off. the trunk of the horror was lifted and quested about  the topaz eyes stared unseeingly  and conan knew the monster was blind. with the thought came a thawing of his frozen nerves  and he began to back silently toward the door. but the creature heard. the sensitive trunk stretched toward him  and conan s horror froze him again when the being spoke  in a strange  stammering voice that never changed its key or timbre. the cimmerian knew that those jaws were never built or intended for human speech. who is here  have you come to torture me again  yara  will you never be done  oh  yag-kosha  is there no end to agony  tears rolled from the sightless eyes  and conan s gaze strayed to the limbs stretched on the marble couch. and he knew the monster would not rise to attack him. he knew the marks of the rack  and the searing brand of the flame  and tough-souled as he was  he stood aghast at the ruined deformities which his reason told him had once been limbs as comely as his own. and suddenly all fear and repulsion went from him  to be replaced by a great pity. what this monster was  conan could not know  but the evidences of its sufferings were so terrible and pathetic that a strange aching sadness came over the cimmerian  he knew not why. he only felt that he was looking upon a cosmic tragedy  and he shrank with shame  as if the guilt of a whole race were laid upon him.
and we all know how well wheel of time went down. no surprise at all now we know this.
so conan wont be ruined by amazon... sounds like a good thing.
conan already has a excellent tv show call primal.
we need as much fn masculinity as we can get right now
good video and good points. you got a new folllower
get genndy tartakovsky to make a conan series. look at what he did with primal.
and then the showrunner goes to hbo  takes over  house of the dragon   and eats amazon s lunch  lol  lotr trop  .
there s nothing  mind boggling  about it. muscle exposure has always been the characters front point of view. why are people so adamant making up bs on social media  people now a days are so sensitive   damn brittle.
robert e. howard would probably say that you cant bend conan to your will  conan breaks your will and then your body.
sure conan is a muscular guy prone to fighting and thieving  and preferring to live in the wilderness instead of cities. but on the whole  isn t he generally one of the more honorable male heroes out there
now if only they would delete all the files from their  wheel of time  rewrite
well  after listening to you for 20 seconds I knew you were the gal for me! just subbed!
thank God. I was dreading the moment a woke conan showed up to watch.
has anyone else noticed that all these movies are being reimagined and re-released for  modern audiences  and  broad appeal  yet no one seems to like them except a very narrow and financially insignificant sliver of the population
they are aware red sonya exists  right granted  I wouldn t want amazon to touch either of those stories
honestly  if they canceled it for being true to the source material its a damn shame. conan is a great story of how a man shook of the bonds of slavery and became not just a king  but conqueror against all forms of foes. it d be perfect to remind men what we do best  fight. for our principles and love ones no matter how great the foe.
if they dont like conan  does that mean they also dont like he man
you could make a good conan movie so obsessed with prequels not sure if it was ever about money or success  Im sure they know what they are doing.
I have no idea what this video is about ... but I watched the whole thing
I know Im going to get hate for this  but I actually liked the reboot trilogy of tomb raider. nparts of it felt repetitive  but overall  I liked it.
the really sad thing about nearly everybody s view of conan is that the source material isn t really very toxic at all.  parochial  sure.  it is a male power fantasy after all.  but in the 50 s it was much more about male power and not so much about toxic treatment of others.  the property itself is also greatly watered down from howard s original vision.  even the authors that finished out the storyline in the original 12 books brought some pretty tiresome tropes to the series  and thats been followed by decades of other comics and novel authors.  conan is a rogue - he lives on the edge of the law and double-deals and backstabs the other ruffians he s dealing with without batting an eye about it.  but he is a man of honor as well  and that is the one trait thatseems to always get lost in the attempts to show everybody how much more badass your version is than everybody else s version.  robert e. howard s conan actually has a surprising lot in common with captain jack sparrow as a character.  he s a pirate  and a good man.  eh... with a lot more violence thrown in.
conan is 100  not in line with everything we do these days.
pretty hard to fit the  f  k  g message  into conan
I bet if anyone did a true to the original source material conan series it would be wildly popular despite the current expressed fabricated culture.
next on amazon - conan the librarian!
you are obviously unqualified to offer an opinion on conan at all.  I will grant you glorification of strength as a theme  but for conan  real conan  thatserves a purpose - it doesnt just exist in a vacuum.
probably because they are the  modern audience  they keep talking about and  broad appeal  means everyone who thinks like they do  so they dont see any issue because everything is aimed at them. everything s pretty much working as intended.none of them even know what the actual modern audience wants  since audiences today dont seem much different to 10-20 years ago.
...he was never a slave  he s even more badass in  the short stories his creator wrote in the 1930s... robert. e. howard look him up.
@sister _ stygian  the slave thing is more specific to the movies if I remember right.
@myles drake  yup  didn t know the difference myself until I happened to pick up a book with a collection of howard s writing in it  back in the early 2010s. I wont knock the movie too much as it got me to pick up the book in the first place  but the conan in the short stories is so much more badass than the arnold version. plus I wouldn t have learned about the completely different characters of howard s that are just as badass or even more so. like solomon kane  kull  bran mak morn  breckinridge elkins. there are more but its hard to get a hold of them. like his boxing and sailor stories and poetry. I also belive he had a detective as well...robert. e. howard  was a pulp writer that doesnt get enough love or exposure  his writing and poetry are really something else.
@sister _ stygian  a lot of the comics do a decent job capturing what happens in the short stories. however most people dont read the comics or short stories which is why I was speaking more on the movies which to this day are some of my favorites the first being my all time favorite. which I d imagine they might keep the part of conan growing up as as a slave gladiator since many are familiar with it.
@myles drake  which is a shame on the latter  as I know conan would rather die than ever be enslaved  even as a kid.
haha I love it
I had a lot of fun playing the 2013 tomb raider game  but I expected lara to have her sass back by the time rise   shadow came out  and she didn t.  but I think tombs and crypts in shadow were incredible  and crystal should get a lot of praise for that  but the game itself bogged down for me by the time I reached the hidden city.  I prefer the less needy lara croft  hopefully embracer will make her more like the old games  when she was mainly solo.
they re good games  but not actual tomb raider games
@melonie mac go boom  the third felt like a rushed cash grab. I would have given it a better outlook if it was more of the same but the overall development of the main antagonist  trinity  could have been done much better.
I liked thecgames as well. but I agree with melonie  that lara doesnt feel like  our lara
to illustrate the misunderstanding this is movie conan -what is best in life to crush your enemies. see them driven before you. and to hear the lamentations of their women.this is book conan - let me live life deep while I live  let me know the rich juices of red meat and stinging wine on my palate  the hot embrace of white arms  the mad exultation of battle when the blue blades flame and crimson  and I am content.  let teachers and priests and philosophers brood over questions of reality and illusion. I know this  if life is illusion  then I am no less an illusion  and being thus  the illusion is real to me. I live  I burn with life  I love  I slay  and am content.
first time that I watch one of your videos. I guess this will not be the last one I watch!
a serious got styled conan series would be really really awesome.  just remake the early comics....omg
ive got the conan book its a treasure its full of battles and I love it  so dont try to ruin it
so the thumbnail for this clip and instantly I thought   she is who neil gayman should have cast as the eternal death morphius  sister on the sandman series!
I luved he conan movies as a kid glad they didn t screw it up... Im still worried over red sonia afraid it will be changed...
lol disney   could totally take this on if he had diversified dwarfs as sidekicks ...
conan the barbarian is my jam. I had all the comics and read all the books and stories. they will ruin conan the same as everything else they ve tried to  re-imagine  in the last decade or so. no one is being honest in their art anymore  people just want to appease the narrative  the woke narrative in this case. they do not care about true fans  they only care about making something that will get them back claps for being so  woke and brave .y all have a badass day
next news from amazon  we re going to make our own game of thrones...in the teletubbies universe
making conan in a way that isn t  toxic  masculinity isn t difficult. so long as they keep him honorable but still a warrior he shouldn t have those traits they detest. aragorn is a great example of masculinity and I doubt anyone would call him toxic. now Im not saying they should write conan like aragorn but its just an example of how it can easily be done.
art is supposed to inspire some sort of feeling reaction.  that feeling reaction can be joy  hatred or apathy.  the artist who fears hatred and apathy and worships joy...will soon find themselves without an audience.
what is best in life  to crush the wokers  see them driven before you  and to hear the lamentation of their wahmen.
these people go around calling everyone else bigots  while unironically hiring people specifically based on the color of their skin  or their gender. they d be going nuts if someone fired someone specifically for those reasons  but what they re doing is no less wrong or disgusting.
they should get the people who did the punisher series to do conan   or somehow get ridley scott to make a conan movie   and conan isn t really a good guy either   not a evil but not a team player
this is a result of the pendulum swinging the other way after the metoo movement. in corporate america  there s always a knee-jerk reaction to bring things to the other extreme immediately after a problem arises instead of solving the problem and taking things where they should be. it will eventually be unpopular enough that it will probably swing back and forth a couple times before it comes to rest.
well... disney- succeeded with rop to dominate the got market in the quality aspect of its last  8th  season. well... disney- even overshadowed it... and I would never thought that this is even possible. but they managed to be worse than the dreaded 8th season of got. well done  Imust say  well done  that was not an easy task.
all the Gods  they cannot sever us. if I were dead and you were still fighting for life  I d come back from the darkness. back from the pit of hell to fight at your side.
aw.  I liked the cartoon.  great showcase in how to take something and make a version of it thats good for kids.
so glad amazon has nothing to do with conan. now it wont be ruined
savage sword of conan was soooooo good
but I bet red sonya will be redone at some point and theyll make her op as hell
yeah. remember conan s sense of honor. people love calling things  morally grey  and game of thrones is popular. but apparently conan is too much for people
@abrahem samander  I dont get it either. its like all the writers just suck at writing compelling characters.
great example of a woman writing good male characters  amy henng who wrote legacy of kain and uncharted 1-3. I wonder if conan was cancelled due to backlash rings of prime got from fans and critics  they probably were going to go into a woke route then were like nevermind.
how aboutariel the sorceress with thindar the barbarian as chief sidekick.
how did the witcher ever get made hey  bezos as conan!
the company who owns the ip will protect it  if its woke he will deny the script.
I was afraid this was about a movie where conan gets demolished by an amazon woman.
thank crom and praise mitra that amazon wont turn conan into a woke mess.
conan was never a perfectly moral character  but the thing is  in his setting  basically no one was. hyboria is set centuries before recorded history. we know how brutal some early civilizations could be  and its the same with conan. he has his good moments  and a sense of honor  but he s as brutal as he needs to be as well. plus he isn t guided by his morality as say  solomon kane is. he robs  slays  and mainly does his missions for selfish reasons. but he is also loyal to comrades  doesnt abuse or rape women frost giants daughter doesnt count because 1. he never actually does it  only plans to. 2. he is driven mad by atalI s magic  he isn t himself.  and if youread the stories in chronological order not publishing.  you see him become more  moral  and  heroic  in the traditional sense of the word.honestly. for a modern pulp accurate conan story to be made. it d honestly have to be made by a b movie company. and thats not necessarily bad.
toxic masculinity  and the fact that naked babes were are such a key element of it.
we live such strange and crazy times.
this would be like if they didnt do a red sonya show because  too much booba
give him to us the fans and we ll cast callum von moger to play him
nooo ! amazon  dont touch him !!! anyway conan can not be adapted to modern standart  its up to the modern standart to adapt to it.
does anyone think of what they did with he-man when listening to this
sooo glad they are not going to ruin conan now
what s funny is you hear about toxic characters and you watch the boy s and they dont want to make conan
its bad when primal is more conan than conan. ps  primal is amazing.
its fantasy we could only  fantasize  about being conan no matter how much toxic masculinity conan puts out which is his whole point of existing in my opinion we can never be that awesome so dont worry it doesnt rub off amazon sucks for empowering these culture killers by giving them the opportunity to weigh in on such an iconic character. if people would just stay in their lane they could make what they enjoy better instead of swerving over and screwing up someone else s perfectly good ride.
I hope men dont fall for it but they re trying to make itso when a woman is attacked a man ain t going to stand up for him they re trying to separate us and that is uncool
to be fair  conan should be played by lizzo. that would just be a-maaaazing!
the easiest and closest way to pronounce einherjar  is ine-her-yar but as one word. origins of word are norse in case your curious about its meaning and related info.
yo soulreaver and legacy of kain still my fav vamp games to date  shit was hardcore
I am glad thatscamazon passed the conan show.
I would have loved a more adult focused conan the barbarian series!
at what point dont they worry about the money and the content and quality of the show instead of check boxes
if conan was remade today  he would be some side character to his own show or movie  while the secondary female character takes the main role as a total badass.
methinks amazon just doesnt like having good shows that will make money for them...
Im ecstatic that conan will not be getting hollyweird s current emasculation treatment of men. at least by amazon in the near future. I cannot think of any studio currently in operation that I cantrust to handle howard s work in the way he meant for it to be done. hell  funcom cant even get conan correct.
at least we have taught one of these misandrist companies to leave our stuff alone.
most of conan is in the public domain... so everyone have at it!
after the treatment amazon gave the wheel of time... a story which literally depended to be told based on the complex gender dynamics of the entire world and the people in it  it would be absolute stupidity for me to expect anything good to have come of an amazon adaptation of conan- whether barbarian  destroyer  usurper or king. I for one am quite relieved.
conan already had an origin story
its kinda good news. but I wish amazon would have looked at red soina and alala the bear  or even the wildlhing jon loved. so there could be powerful females. while cona can do his  manly things . if the girls wanted to join in kool. plus it actually has a lot of different races. so thats diversity on a plate.  did they want conan to talk his way out of every skirmish.
does anyone else find it funny that they replaced a character that robert jordan officially expounded on for a series that he  wrote  just hope they didn t completely it.
kill bill and buffy vampire slayer . 2 strong popular  female lead projects. would probably suck if they tried to make now.
conan would be mindless and subservient to red sonja in a series done by amazon.
this is amazing news
watch 1982 s conan the barbarian with arnold schwarzenegger. there s your conan  origin story . it was arnie s big breakout role and it also stars  the voice of darth vader  james earl jones. cant beat that.  if you want more conan   watch conan the destroyer  1984   and the  spin-off  film red sonja  1985  with brigitte nielsen  also starring arnie.oh  and there is also the 2011 remake reboot starring jason momoa  if thats of any interest.
read robert e. howard s original works. they are beyond amazing. I recommend the del rey paperback editions. kull  conan  solomon kane  bran mak morn  etc. he wrote so many great pulp heroes. dont waste your time with these  modern  adaptations. the comics are fun and the live action movies were okay  incredible soundtracks though .
well at least  they did good with the boys
kinda relieved  sounds like it would have been a mess anyway. like demolition man  but at the expense of an iconic character that I grew up with.
clicked because I saw the Godzilla     tattoo in the thumbnail
and red sonja would be portrayed by a black actress.
this. right. here.unfortunately  his range of stories and characters is rather limited  many times even interchangeable  so his entire library gets samey.  but his setting descriptions   man.  the cinematography just writes itself.
based
a good female writer is rare and a great one may not even exist. man are way better at telling stories making in depth characters and stories
they have ruined conan in the past with a tv show and a child friendly animated series. and they both were cancelled after a single season. robert e howard created a popular character and world that people enjoy nearly 100 years after he wrote it. I guess its just hard for hollywood to understand that maybe  just maybe  keeping a franchise true to its roots might actually make itsuccessful.
I really hate that everything going digital and these little worms can editstuff as they want. only going to get worse.
nowadays I d only trust robert eggers to touch conan. I cant think of another director that would do the character justice.
wanna see the perfect example  look what netflix do to he-man
same thing happening to witcher. the writers dont like the source books and the games so its no wonder henry cavill left. he originally intended to do seven seasons as he was such a fan of the story  but the writing  if you pardonthe pun  was on the wall.
conan cannot be emasculated. thats exactly why they wouldnt touch him  the og conan comics were insane!
good characters are the products of good writers regardless of sex  walk of life  or other such inconsequential  things. there in lies the problem  the put falderal before the person s worth while abilities that pertain to the thing they were hired for.if fools will quite treating people like pok mon then things will be better off. better yet remove the fools in the way of their own success let alone your business . until then stop touching things!
if I want to watch conan ill just watch the original series with arnold. todays writters producers directors would not even come close to the perfection of those movies.
I dont get amazon. have different sectors there  why they can do good things  brute styles  like reacher and terminal list but cant do conan
any remake that comes out in this point of time is doomed to fail in my opinion. the only people that are gonna pick up an old piece of media are the ones that care about making money off of it rather than cause they actually feel passionate about it.
I doubt they all red howard s work. its a lot. they re just saying that to give themselves a pat on the back. these people dont like those kinds of stories because its to complexed and lore filled and requires trigger warnings for them and since it doesnt have that  they d close the book and go back to vice
yur dope!thank you so much.love yur show.
alpha males used to be a staple of cinema. now virtually every male is either a villain or a bumbling fool. there is the occasional exception.some day I d like to see a version of conan that is more lovecraftian in nature  a little closer to reh s style with conan  kull  and solomon kane.
they ve already done movies  tv series  and cartoons.
when was there a conan cartoon how true to source was the arnie movie
as a huge conan fan I d rather not have the show then watch another loved i.p. get destroyed.
may I ask wish cartoon she is refering to at the begginning  I think I have a hunch she is refering to he-man. but Imight be wrong.
if they had used conan they could have also used a strong female character in the form of red sonja. but these people obviously dont think about the strong female characters that already exist.
I am so glad amazon wont be ruining my favorite king of thieves
I was thinking he-man but Im stupid
funnily enough  if they stuck to the story s roots conan probably would ve been a pretty good answer to game of thrones  definitely better than lotr at least  the tone of conan would ve been more similar.
to be honest conan is a rough property for today s market  it was probably more about concern of backlash  viewer hate  and society bs repercussions.  pissing off wheel of time fanboI is fine  pissing off the politically correct hierarchy not so much.  thatsaid  conan absolutely did have a lot of very weak cliche female characters that needed saving and couldn t tie their own shoes.... much like many of these comic covers suggest.  thatsaid there were plenty of weak male characters too.I do remember one pretty funny story though where he was actually shacking up with this bad ass female pirate captain and this local tavern owner lady at the same time.  only they find out he was two timing them.  then at the conclusion of the story he sees these boots tossed into the hall outside the tavern owners room and he gets pissed thinking she is cheating on him.  he busts down the door ready to throw down and kick some guys ass.... only to find out they went lesbian and the pirate captain and tavern keeper are now banging.  they laugh him out of the room and he kinda just shuffles out and leaves super embarrassed.  story ends.so yeah  there was some of that too.
imagine conan coming out of his tent with a frilly thong on.  2022 woke power.
I imagine in the end there will be two distinct groups of creators. one for wokies  which is a small percentage of the population  and one for everyone else.
yes  they wont ruin it! yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeessss
if amazon had remade conan they would have recast whoppI goldberg as conan. thankfully  netflix has it
henry cavill or chris hemsworth would make a great conan. but only if hbo picks it up and they stick to the source material.
dang  I was hoping for a  connie the barbarian  but I guess there s no money in it.  its always about the money  in it
jason mamoas movie wasn t quite conan but it would ve been better in that vein than anything amazon s production team would ve made.
and Im here playing conan exiles as I watch this...
your hair looks great melanie
makes me glad I bought the old conan video game on xbox . its not exactly appropriate for a modern audience .  they cant take it away from me now
as you say probably for the best  but damn apparently to some of these people men who are strong and competent   toxic.
if amazon wants to leave money on the table  so be it. their loss is netflix s gain.
conan! king! new to channel.
man the game could have used a good series with the new xpac. would love a bunch of new blood into conan. had they done even a decent job  they could have taken the entire market with just conan.
funny how the hottest women are attracted to  toxic  masculinity in men....hollywood like usual is clueless.....great content mel!!
moved from amazon to netflix... ....oooofh.
nobody anywhere could produce a conan program and keep it true to the source. not in the west. we re chained to the tree of woke.
they will one coming out with a series where conan gets a sex-change operation  though.
in other words  all the new productions will be for the minority group  and the rest of us will go back to watching movies and shows from the 70s and 80s -- when they tried to actually entertain an audience.
great observations!
just amazing!
its funny that one of the most powerful and popular female character in dc comics aka wonder woman was created by a man. he also created the lie detector which was base off the lasso of truth.
good! cant ruin it like they ve done so many other stories and franchises.
try to imagine a woke  re-imagination  of the 90 s pc game  duke nukem 3d ... thatshould be hilarious...
conan wouldn t get rejected by   civilised   city-dwellers  because he would never ask for their approval. he feels zero inferiority when seeing fancy clothes  or large buidlings.
conan by amazon would be a utter disaster !!! sell it to a company that will be honest with the source material!
they must have caught the cast having a bathroom break.
they are worried that conan would be just as successful as rings of power...oh wait rop isn t successful my bad my bad.
the would turn it into a woker version of rings of power
any new conan series absolutely must  must  absolute positively has to have... the lamentations of the women.  you cannot have conan without it.
conan was brutal and violent   but so was his world. his character was always bound by honor and a code of ethics. a noble savage meant to contrast and confrint the corruption and weakness of modern civilisation the howard saw and despised  even in his own time. I dont want to imagine a version of this story corrupted by modern  hollywokeness
amazon needs to keep out of making shows and movies and stick to delivering my weird-flavored chips from around the world.
we are in the post-metoo apocalyptic landscape.  for a man to get trapped by it now  he s either gotta be incredibly stupid  or this was a hit job by metoo activists.
dont say nothing when hulu takes it.
until we know there was any kind of money spent  considering  it  Im skeptical about this being more a virtue signaling marketing ploy.
if they had made conan  I bet they would add a female character that would do everything conan does but better without losing anything for it.
amazon scraps conan because  best caveman impression  man bad  heavy breathing  men bad bad rarweerrrr.....
I wonder if a red sonja would be a female toxicity being she s a female  conan
it pisses me off when people take a tried and true story like conan  tomb raider  iron fist and others and make them something they are not just to please one segment of society.
we need king conan.
watched this after having a workout having a horn of wine and a piece of salted raw meat. yes  dont even try to spoil my bro conan  pathetic scumbags!
please God dont let it be like masters of the universe
itseems sometimes like all of filmmaking has simultaneously developed a crippling fear of money and success.conan is easy to do. all you have to do is give him something to kill and a reason to do so. you dont even have to show his womanizing side at all. you can successfully and easily drop his womanizing if you wanted to. schwarzenegger s conan basically did!just a great  skilled  and cunning warrior with enemies to kill. thats it. that is all you need. but apparently  showing a strong man is too problematic.
probably for the best to be honest.
conan a big buff masculine man  reeeeeeeee!!!!
yes  please dont denad conan
conan no!conina... yeees!
glad amazon isn t going to trash conan. I was always more of soloman kane guy  so I hope it doesnt get anywhere near it too.
so I guess jeff bezos getting all jacked since his divorce should be viewed as toxic.
the irony of the  toxic masculinity  accusations from writers is that these same people will write  strong  women with a hyper-masculinity that no actual male character could get away with because it would be too ridiculous a caricature.  even the most masculine male heroes  like james bond  smile  make jokes  experience grief and loss  and have moments of vulnerability.  today s mary sue female characters have none of these things - even though they make characters likable and relatable while keeping the masculine side grounded.  the conan stories by re howard are brilliant  and already subversive in their own clever  subtle way.  those who think conan is  toxic masculinity  genuinely haven t the most remote understanding of the source material.
modern hollywood doesnt care about what these ip s are supposed to be and only about putting their own spin on them so they can be  better .  I de rather have these stories be untouched by modern creators and left for those who want to find them unspoiled.
so rings of power flops and conan gets cancelled  yeah. they know it wasnt going to be well received. Lord of the rings franchise is single handedly destroying woke messaging now that the company is losing money  and itshows just how much they really cared about their message. money is more important to them in the end  what a surprise.
used to watch her years ago! now she has so many tats xd
yes  amazon hates men. thats why they made reacher  and the boys. rage tubers are so so tiring.
everybody should listen to the original conan the barbarian books its great.
by crom . conan was my favorite childhood hero  still got all the comics and books. they would never have been able to deliver the real conan anyway  as it was far to masculine and brutal. and wft cimmerians driven out of cimmeria  would never happen.
imagine stargate now. it would be wokegate.
reminds me of primes wheel of time series. wot was well recieved because itstayed mostly true too its source. they did some race swapping  but its just accurate enough. this with the wot world set being a full on matriarchy setting  where women hold most power positions. fans enjoy its authenticity  wokesterz like it as itspeaks too their ideology. my only criticism of wot is that they ve left out some gore near as I cantell. like black sisters skinning aes sedaI alive in order too strip them of the source and taking their powers for example.
gender fluid conan the hardworking and independent
comics today have become nothing  but licensed fanfic. same with the movies and shows based on them.
what is ironic and frustrating about all this is that those who actually bother to read conan fiction will know how absurd this attitude is. while these stories are hardly the pinnacle of english literature  they are entertaining. more pertinently  conan is always depicted as very respectful  and a defender of women. apparently these days  being male and toxic masculinity is one and the same thing  at least as far as some media outlets are concerned!
im pretty sure any other production company can produce conan its broken writing that will ruin the series
this is great news. thank God filth amazon is keeping their hands off conan. they should have done the same with lotr
one day the actor of conan will wear thongs
what I want amazon to do is bring out a series about the spartans where the spartans are actually homosexual  because they were. then perhaps even conan can make an appearance and get some of that good man love for himself.
ruining james bond ended my yearly tradition of going to the theaters
amazon f-ed up.
yea conan is theology for some of us and Im glad they dont touch conan
wokes look at what someone is rather than who someone is.
einherjar    ine - here - yahr   old norse meaning   honered dead warrior who resides in valhalla and will participate in the final battle of ragnarok  edit added an  r  to the pronounciation guide as in the language they included the ending r like in american english
can starz who made the excellent and peerless  in its genre   spartacus.....make a conan the barbarian  show       please!!!! I need to see crixus the undefeated gaul be conan!!!! he has the best troubled brow!!!!
us guys dont mind. we ll just take our business else where
the original conan the barbarian was done perfectly in 1982. they had good writing  acting  directing  music. it checked all the boxes  and I doubt it will ever be topped. I love the sound of a conan reboot  just as much as I d love a masters of the universe reboot  but if it cant be done right  then I d rather itstay in the past. no more cheesy  half assed movies and series.
its probably for the best  amazon track record isn t the best
robert ervin howard.one the best american writers of the 20th century.
this is probably a good thing that amazon isn t touching conan.
listening to the article Im glad it never got made.
Im not sure how this channel ended up in my feed  but this woman is very attractive....and I agree that conan would get ruined by amazon.
a bold strategy cotton......
men are awesome and conan is one of the ultimate men.  conan would be my dream president.
I enjoy exaggeration in story telling  I caught a fish thats  so big  . conan is the classic fantasy hero story from the 30s  having his own type of morality code  saving children and damsels in an old fashion chivalric style from those terrible villains.  guess we should replace those stories with power women that ignore other women and kill all the men -- why would I want to tell my grandchildren a story like that
I cancelled my amazon prime cause amazon is bad  objectively bad   and Im glad they aren t ruining conan like they did with wheel of time and tolkien.
youre wrong. they weren t going to reinvent his origin. what they were literally going to do was follow the source material to a t. thats why they got rid of it
watch primal on adult swim  not conan  but probably can scratch that conan itch.
toxic masculinity is code for  the fans are gonna love this show. let s burn it!
yup  origin story means rebranding. thats what gunn is planning with superman. so sad.
...... hold your tongue wench!!!!! .....no  not you melonie .....hahah.... that is an actual quote from a conan the barbarian comic book....there are many  many more like it. is that what they are referring to   not the sanitised arnold version  ...or the ultra sanitised momoa version
I d rather people wait until this woke era has ended before they start trying to dig up more old beloved franchises to revive them. all amazon would have done was desecrate it.
a man needs no memory -- only a soul -- to know that this is not right! conan the barbarian vol 1 121
omg  if they aren t going to stick to the conan cannon story from comics and old movies but modernising it  then why bother even looking at recreating it
thank God. given amazon s mindset for deciding not to make it  I shudder to think what they would have actually done with it had they made a conan series. Im beyond tired of every ip I like being unapologetically ruined  and then pretending like people like us are problematic for not supporting the steaming turd of a show movie that comes out of it.
by crom  we dodged a bullet there!
so they dropped conan because of  toxic masculinity  yet the irony is that they create toxic female characters who are amazing immediately at everything  simply for being a woman and are better than every male on the screen and she s  perfect  its just everybody else who has the problem.Im glad they re not making conan and leaving well alone cause they wont adapt the material directly if its aimed mainly at a male audience  they ll introduce a  strong female  who s his equal and insert so much gender politics that you end up thinking  why did you even bother
skyfall wasn t james bond. critics liked that it wasn t james bond.
damn. after mcu fucked up shuma gorath  I was really hoping conan might use the character and do it better.
you can have the masculinity and the primal allure of conan and the setting around him without it being inherently toxic. should there be some toxic assholes in the setting  yes  by crom  but you dont need conan to be a 4chan dwelling grobnard  either. throughout tons of his stories  from howard and beyond  conan treats his comrades with respect once they ve earned it in his eyes. valeria  belit  and red sonja and her she-wolves band are among them  with belit being the love of his life.
I was waiting on mamoa conan.  I guess they dont like money.
Im really hoping netflix does this right. conan is all that is man and should be written that way. the world of conan is a brutal and unforgiving world. people are savage in that world because that is how they survive. conan has a strong foundation and could be an amazing show if done honestly and purelyadditionally conan would be a perfect setting for strong women because in the world of conan if you are not strong you are fucking dead.if they would just let strong characters happen organically vs shoehorning it in then it most media would be so much better.
having a woke company trying to do conan. yeah its good they didn t try to do it.
women actually have conan s respect all the time  unless they prove they dont deserve it.  men must earn respect  but even weak men can do that in his eyes if they have strength of character.
things are changing  the pendulum is swinging but as itstands right now  a true to form version of conan  is not possible and any attempt by who currently has the wheel  will epically fail...
probably for the best  especially after what that new he-man show did to the character. odd they re okay with reacher though  somehow that got passed the whiners. besides  its never going to be better than primal.
I am no longer a marvel universe fan anymore
conan doesnt need an origin story  the first movie did that and it doesnt need improving.
sick Godzilla arm tattoo my dude.
a well done conan could be as good as got but amazon apparently cant just commit to crushing of their enemies and the lamentation of the women
love the hair.
I naturally assumed they would race and gender swap conan
the funny thing is the same masculine traits are seen as good when its displayed by women but problematic when men act like men.
huh Im glad !  thnx amazon !
the funny thing with the wot is that  as anyone who has read the books knows  it is totally against the woke agenda in the sense that the core of the story is the need for balance between the masculine and feminine aspects of humanity!
conan actually never was just about brute streanth. alone with brute streanth you cant build and hold a whole kingdom. Im male and love tomb raider  aslong its not a movie.
amazon is ruining anything they touch like ea games xd
I d rather amazon not fuck with conan than having them fuck it up.
just writing here for support of this vid. thanks!
they wouldn t know how to write a classic masculine hero....
they probably would have f ed it up or demasculated the hell out of the character anyway. jason mamoa s incarnation is probably the best and most accurate we will see. I fear popular culture and the preservation there of will be the least of our problems soon.
keep hard against the wall  woman! we ll take many of these snake-lovers with us ere we fall!
perhaps conan didn t anticipate how powerful the lamentations of the women would be in the 21st century.
what about red sonja then or she-ra
netflix will probably screw it up too. hate to say but they dont have the best record for adaptations .Im rather amazed conan ever got considered by any of these streaming services.
back in the day 70 80  90 s we appreciated anything we could get. now itseems people like killing it before its seen  or running with gossip. all for some kind of perfect movie in your head. I find this weird.
amazon is too busy pissing on tolkien to take time to piss on robert e. howard.
some things hollywood should never touch today. I have a couple other book series  I never want any studio to touch. but even if they considered conan toxic there are so many powerful women in hyboria that even he met his match on.also  worried for netflix adaption. especially what they did to season 2 of witcher. did yennifer wrong  unforgiveable wrong. as for malmberg  he s a charlatan. am I wrong that melonie looks and is as strong and independent as belit
I dont want them to make a conan. today s hollywood isn t up to the task.
after rop why would anyone want them to do conan in the first place
this is my issue.  conan universe has warrior women.   everyone is a warrior in conan.  sabotaging shows  from the past that already promotes  strong women characters is just ridiculous
Ive pretty much stopped watching most of hollywood stuff lately. I ll watch a few things  older movies  youtube and documentaries about animals lol.
please note  in about 6 years anybody can make their own adaptation of conan the barbarian s first story   the phoenix on the sword  because conan will be will within public domain by that point.why do I bring this up  oh...no reason...
he s called a barbarian!
fucking hell..... they could make an interesting show conan and still have a good strong well written female character traveling with him or one of the enemies conan face could be an evil well written female snake cultist or something.
Im ecstatic that they cancelled conan.  they would ve ruined and wussified him.  100  they would ve had a woman or three somewhere constantly dunking on him.
conan still ha a great game going just git uodated with sorcery at start of sept this year  conan exiles is getting updates every 3 months now if all goes to plan
...or it might be that the hyperborian storyline is just dated.howard worte his books 50 years ago  the last successful conan movie war 30 years ago  and fancoms conan mmorpg ist quite dead.so amazon might just cut their losses.sometimes as a fan its just to re-read the books or found an rpg group of like minded people.
anyway I avoid everything from amazon all because there toxic personal policy.
henry david thoreau said that the worth of a man is determined by what he can do without.  women make 70 to 80 percent of the purchase decisions in the united states so of course amazon and the media as a whole is catering to women.  however  the first sentence makes men very powerful or dangerous in other  more lasting  time tested ways.
wow you must be the most beautiful tomboy Ive ever seen. I guess I agree with everything you said  because it all sounded like sweet music to me. go boom!
I never thought I d see the day where conan was defeated by a blue haired land whale...
I dont know if Imissed some drama around tomb raider lol  but I actually found it a breath of fresh air considering all the woke crap. I didn t play the original games so maybe thats why  but with the new games I liked that it was female led but didn t make any identity politics statement in the content  at least not that I noticed  in both the newer games and the movie. they also didn t make her a mary sue imo. they explained how she became skilled and she still got her butt beat several times and couldn t beat the main baddy by using kickboxing. she had to outmaneuver him. dont get me wrong  she was op in the movie  and the games  but I dont mind that  when she s kind of supposed to be op. I just dont like when they re op for no reason and have no struggles with anything  when she clearly struggles throughout the film. anyway. sorry. if there is issues with it though  dont tell me because I enjoyed the games and the movie for what they were and I dont want it to be ruined by wokeness and stupidity that Imay have missed during the behind the scenes  and it may totally be there but I want to pretend it wasn t!
woke is starting to become a cringe worthy word for sure.. but  problematic  is one that immediately just flips thatswitch for me. the following word dont even register.. just static lol
thatstory takes place after conan becomes king so how can it be first
@scott heathco  it was first in publication. first conan story written in 1932.
@mitchell alexander  the story is already on youtube and I doubt they got permission from anyone
the reboot trilogy is extremely woke lol. I have made many videos about this on this channel if you d like to go down the rabbit hole
@melonie mac go boom  is the content woke or the narrative around it  when I played the games I dont remember the content of the story being woke but I could be misremembering. I ll check out those videos
these folks with degrees that were formerly useless now all have jobs. diversity studies  that and a food handling certification could get you a job serving. now these companies absolutely have to have a whole department to get a good score on esg.
the really odd part is conan in the original howard stories is kind of a feminist at least in the 30s context
and the surprising part of this is....
my wife hates this movement to get rid of men as heroes.as she tells it  she isn t interested in seeing women as heroes  she wants to so masculine shirtless men.
agree its about  erasing the past  otherwise they would invent create their own new thing.  instead of remaking everything.
I have to wonder how the story of moses would be treated in this day and age  then.
I wish they would have banned the remake  ring s of power  seeing that tolkien was one of us bad  toxic males .
honestly glad they cancelled it knowing hollywood s track record it would definitely get butchered
good  conan has been saved from another God awful reboot. this is a blessing in disguise.
I think this is old news. I heard about this years ago.
good. I dont think they could adapt it as faithfully from the source materials considering theres a lot of beautiful half naked women most of the time. some are even outright naked. and we all know how those from the movement would react. plus  the comics might get ruined if a a live adaptation garners the attention of the wrong people. tarna already got ruined.
pretty sure they will be cancelling a lot of projects since rings of power is a complete failure as the most expensive show in history and not making one cent  so they gotta go into money saving mode.
how s that wheel of time working out for you amazon   I am reading the books right now but have 0 desire to watch 1 second of thatshow.
good to hear they re not doing it. Im reading the complete chronicles of conan currently. its good old fashioned hack and slash  sword and sorcery. hollywood with all its antImasculine woke politics need to leave conan well alone. I doubt any attempt at a conan tv show would do it justice.
of course they would hate men! they are amazons!
Imuch prefer the shadow of the tomb raider era as lara felt more real. in the first instalment  she s afraid  bleeding out and struggling- compared to her very first incarnation who was pretty much woke before it existed... an unrelatable mary sue that I just didn t take to
capitalism   produce what you want  but if people dont like it they wont buy it.  socialism   produce what we tell you or we wont let people buy it.
bulled dodged by conan
normally I d be at least kinda sorta on your side but in the case of conan  staying true to the character would mean traveling around with whatever slave-girl he d recently acquired  chasing a frost giant s daughter with the intend of having his way with her  or a number of other things that really wouldn t be taken well by the average modern audience. making the show profitable would mean watering down the character too much. if you like conan  read the pulp stories. fafhrd and gray mouser would make for a better show adaptation anyway.
they just love loosing   and fans.so tragic.
popular opinion  things were better before  woke nessunpopular deduction  things were better before  woke ness because we had guys who would eventually get metoo d who knew how to write better content than  woke  writers  because of their metoo-able tendencies.
one of the issues I have with this  wokeness  is these writers are too afraid to have their female led protagonist fall in love with a man or protect the men or try to woo a man  they always make them lesbian and or man-haters.... no one wants that.
wish they would have abandoned several characters and franchises but oh well.
see  thats what they dont really understand. characters like conan and he-man are deeply rooted in the male power fantasy  regardless of whether or not you consider it be good or bad. if you change that inherent quality about characters like that then they cease to be those characters. conan is no longer conan when you start changing and shifting things around like that. another character similar to that is james bond which is another old fashioned hyper masculine character that happens to be deeply rooted in what some would call misogynistic stereotypes. if you change that about james bond then he ceases to be james bond. its just the way it is. that being said  Im glad they canceled conan because they probably would ve just produced a socially progressive caricature of conan and not the true conan that everyone loves and grew up with.
its for the best.
call kevin smith!  he d do a great job on conan!in one story  conan s woman betrays him to the city guard.  conan finds out and he takes her and throws her into the public sewer.  she screams and yells as he walks away smirking.hahaahaha  they would never dare do that on netflix or amazon.
they act like conan is some kind of misogynist. because he s known for saving damsels and having  gasp  sex. but  they also dont realize that the conan franchise has also created some iconic strong female characters. red sonja is just a renowned as conan. valeria was a hyper badass who still kicked ass after she died. zula is not as known but she was also a great character that was far ahead of her time. a strong black female character!  in 1984!  whaaaat. let s just forget about her and call the franchise  toxic  and  masculine . fucking. assholes.conan is a strong male character  who saves the day  fights and kills evil entities and gets the girl. he s the perfect male fantasy character. and that is enough for them to think its  toxic . thats the truth.
well look what amazon did to lotr with a billion dollar budget. imagine how bad they would mess up conan.
npc s  men cant write women! they only know how to make them the damsel in distress! they never make them strong  independant  and able to take care of themselves without the help of a man!!me  really  then explain how I created  mercy  a girl who literally gets her rocks off on bloodshed and cantake on entire battalions of armed guards by herself without even using the full limits of her abilities  due to her power over shadows and control over the pain receptors of others. to add the cherry to the cake  she s also a lesbian and in a relationship with my other character pyra  who s also a badass and can control flames and  like a pheonix  can revive herself from death should she recieve a fatal attack. or miyu  a girl who follows the samuraI code and has more skill than the combined skill of every one of the strongest samuraI in history. and can wipe out literal armies solo and is powerful to the point thatshe is the only one that raelia  a literal God and main antagonist  is slightly afraid of.or fuck even shizuko  a literal child who  like mercy  cantake on literal battalions of soldiers by herself due to cruel experimentation and just gets better  more ruthless  and brutal the more she fights. I got a lot more examples if you so choose to learn more.npc s  men cant write powerful and strong female characters!!!!me  you people are fucking retarded...
zack snyder wrote wonder woman btw
ehh  the conan franchise dodged a bullet. let  the rings of power  be a warning to all lest your ships be dashed upon the rocks.
conans better off being kept away from these people anyway. he is masculinity untrammled and untainted and desrves better than amazon.
God forbid you show men in any way other than bad
its easy to write female characters.all you have to do is imagine a male character and then remove reason and accountability.
not even mad they re already trying to kill Lord of the rings and the wheel of time leave conan the barbarian alone
I had a few conan comics as a kid and yes it was pretty awesome  the woke should just leave everything alone  please dont touch anymore  like telling a little kid dont touch.
I think amazon is bad and toxic  so I dont see a problem. they ruin everything indeed so I see it as a positive they abandon conan. amazon should get banned from all original stories because they make their own bad series of it any way. p.s. its a sad thing too many people show no backbone  criticizing amazon for being toxic  then order something at the same company  giving them the means to go be more toxic.
the books was written in the 30 s after ww1
yeah  I absolutely dont want an amazon version of conan. I can just imagine it  conan the pescatarian. in the days of high adventure  we follow the story of the non-binary scoliosis-ridden pescatarian  conan  as xer battles against micro aggressions and inequality in an epic quest to smash the patriarchy.
amazon s conan  aka  the lamentations of the women .
well  the women kinda do  obviously.  particular women anyway. the problem with the writers is that  to make plausible stories  your characters should act like people really act unless youre making an obvious satire.
countdown for a completely over the top  woke  masculinity hating red sonja  Im figuring announcements of it in 6 months
lets get this straight  they are calling  it    toxic masculinity.  um  excuse me if know its toxic why dont you actually develop a good story line then without being so sensitive to strong male characters. like  if you are so enlightened  why dont you just show us how great of a visionary writer you are. oh they cant. why  because that would take actual effort and vision  aka money.
they are called amazon after all.
Imean... if they want it to be about a powerful female character instead  just switch to red sonja.
there is a person called einherjar  thats awesome!
next  hollywood will produce corrective biblical movies about strong independent women  eve  adam eats all the apples    delilah  toxic sampson is defeated by virtuous smart woman   salome  defeats cult leader to get ahead in life .
loved the movies but hated how everybody thinks the barbarian is his title. more often than not  robert e howard referred to conan as the cimmerian
good  I dont want anything else ruined.
I love how all these people pretend studio s are doing this to  include   show representations for other groups and markets.......... yet they never include asians when they do. which is hilarious because its the biggest market lol
to be honest they most likely cancelled it cause they are loosing their ass with their Lord of the rings series.
sadly conan is just a character from another time. people forget the most recent attempt with jason momoa  it had all of the staples of the conan character but just fizzled at the box office. also to compare to wonder woman  even objectively it is such a mediocre movie and really falls apart on itself as the earlier attempts to make her a  strong woman  are contradicted by her motivation coming from steve trevor s death. her actions were the result of a man s decision  but strong woman!
well  there s really no such thing as  toxic masculinity .   a better description is  men who refuse to go woke .
do not dare touch the king of aquilonia!!
wheel of time was a travesty. episode 8 is the reason my expectations were so low that I was actually pleasantly surprised at rings of power  as bad as it can be.
ein - her - yar is the pronunciation of that word
cleaning house as far as a work environment. totally get it. trying to make all characters non toxic in a world where everyone has some toxic trait  is dumb. it isn t relatable  and you cant connect or empathize with the story. alien  strong female character. isn t all knowing or overpowered.star wars  fa  rey doesnt struggle to learn  she beats a trained ben every time.
who the hell runs amazon  it is insane. they make shows for nobody. conan is not a toxic character. he is a reluctant hero. he actually does not treat women bad and even fights and takes orders from some of them in the books. he lives in a brutal world and is a bad ass. that is in no way toxic. clowns.
is that a gojira tattoo on your arm
why would they need conan   they already have guyladriel the barbarian. he asked with any sarcasm or disappointment completely hidden by text s lack of tone.
its down hill from here. no chance for change.
we ll always have the source material original media  be that films  tv shows  games  comics  books etc. bad interpretations of a beloved world characters is nothing new but is pretty much guaranteed today as all our favourite worlds are being buried by pathetic woke ideology. the last thing I want to see now is a live action version of those things that I hold dear  but when it does happen I disregard it and simply dont watch it. head canon rules  there is no such thing as  official canon  as far as Im concerned.
its sad they want all male characters now to all be either  weak   dl or gay in some form or another.  connan is supposed to be badass. its already been established and has a fanbase. new commers with no part of the original always try to reshape the source to fit their narrative. red sonja and valeria as females are badass  if that helps  another discussion is ethnic stereotypes.
finally they could refrain themselves from ruining something.
if conan ever got remade....I guarantee you....he would die in the first episode....and it would become a redemption story that focuses on his daughter. watch.
its fine cause as it turns out...men actually hate amazon.  so weird
any chance that it went to netflix because we ve seen in  the witcher  that they can do brutal male power fantasies without being toxic  and the show-runners really liked that and.....sorry to be so politically incorrect about this but the only conan series that would actually work is one that changed the character substantially from the books -- unless you want something like a fantasy  breaking bad  or something  where you root for an anti-hero who does things to innocents you dont care about that you d hate it if they did to innocents you do care about.  is that what you all want  not me  but hey  maybe the market s not at where Im at.  the 80s movies you all think youremember substantially changed the character. even the first  r-rated movie very seriously softened him up from the books.and my vote goes to.....make something new!!!!!-an anonymous nerd
the reasoning is stupid  but amazon not doing conan is a win if you like conan. it would just be a show called conan that had elements vaguely resembling conan.
Imean thank God  if amazon made it then it would be terrible.
only movie about conan is conan the king with arny as conan. we were promised it years ago.as a true conan fan who fawned over the original stories as a kid even the delaurentis movies had issues but were pretty good. first off conan was tall  black haired blue eyed.arnold was none of that. but he did have the physique down. but Im glad this series got scrapped.
hbo should get conan the barbarian...
I ll agree with you that usually an origin story is just taken as an opportunity to change a character  and yes thats dumb as hell because if they re popular enough for you to invest all this money into  then why wouldn t you just make it into a movie tv version of the book comic it already was  but in all fairness  thats not relegated to just origin stories. its like these studios think they re contractually obligated to look in the cringiest corners of reddit 4chan tumblr for people writing the most desperate  deluded fan fiction in existence and throw money by the truckload at them. Im not stupid about how media marketing works  I give them a little bit of a pass when it comes to origin stories because it allows them to introduce new people to the characters and the story  but I also think they underestimate how a different media or a definitive  this is where you start  jumping on point can be for a property. good story and good characters are what originally bring people to be interested in a property to begin with. it d be really nice if they would just try that once and see how it plays out. dont bring in writers and directors who want to  reinvent  a story or  put their own spin on it.  if you were that talented at coming up with characters   stories then why are they using someone else s property instead of your s
glad this happened  dont want to see conan getting told his ways are toxic  seeing that he is the route of all of hybroria s problems  owned constantly by his stronger  better  female equivalent..we need a company that wont put their beliefs and  messages  before the source material. stop trying to make everything the next game of thrones  the fantasy genre and sword and sandal sorcery genre are actually alot more different than these executive idiots realise..I ll just keep watching primal and hoping gendy tartakovskI  gets the rights to make a conan animated show.
if you turn off sound she makes much more sense.
Im getting a little tired of hero stories being described as  power fantasy.   when we make movies and tv shows that have sword fighting  super hero women  its a power fantasy.  male super hero stories is part of a tradition that goes back thousands of years to telling stories in caves - they are meant to tell young men   this is what we need you to be - a hero with a moral sense as strong as your arms.   its more than ego gratification  its a guide telling men what society needs them to be.  society doesnt ask women to risk their lives to be useful  it asks men to do it.
thank you.
I know for myself I can only be interested in heroes that are 20 something  high school dropout  balding  soy moobs are especially noticeable  and simps for a future that is female and is incredibly outspoken about it. also doesnt use animal product.
would be nice if amazon cared as much about workers rights as they do about gender rights
11 02 it  woke  work! - one could say
toxic masculinity.... how is the character who has an excessive capacity to do violence that is made dangerous by using itsmartly  in a setting that for the most part lacks any real sense of moral character when he has a very empathetic set of morals  do unto others as you would wish done on to you and the quest for self improvement  a toxic character
im gonna sub to you  im tired of guys faces only popping up in my fed lol
the incredibly delicious irony of all this is that game of thrones  that one-of-a-kind unicorn of blockbuster success everyone is chasing so hard  is literally a showcase for toxic masculinity and its effects on a pre-industrial society.  being unwilling to approach thatsubject authentically is exactly why reproducing thatsuccess eludes amazon.
I think they should let the free market determine what movies get produced in america. personally  Im not all that fond of the hypermasculine leading man in a movie. that character has been done so much. I prefer a more complex character like mickey rouarc in  the wrestler  or russel crowe in  cinderella man .  clint eastwood can be a good leading man in some movies  but he also sometimes followed that hollywood formula of that bad ass who is really very sensitive inside. that guy isn t a character. he is a formula. but the public cant get enough of him  and if that is what they want to watch they have that right.
the awesome first conan film was removed cancelled from cable several years ago.  that is why you only see conan 2 with its massive amounts of conan simping on network tv now.  conan has to be looked at as a simp according to the media companies.  nuff said.
well considering that the terminal list is a huge success and rings of power is a complete failure... they might want to rethink their strategy.  really
take it from someone who has been a robert e. howard fan since childhood--ain t no way you can make conan woke in the least. Ive been known to refer to netflix as  wokeflix   so Im not holding my breath about them staying true to conan. because canon ! the new school activist writers only see that as an obstacle. then they get mad when they dont get their participation trophies in the form of those of us who are not media shills fawning all over their hot garbage  re-imagining  aka ruining classic canon in the name of muh diversity. no thank you. p.s.  you are totally rocking the long hair  miss melonie!
I think only hbo could this right.
decades ago  when I noticed the first signs of the far left sliding down the slippery slope of unceasing blame  I was outraged by their deranged devotion to their cultic nonsense. but today  though I still oppose their obsolete and obscene dogma  I genuinely pity them. they display profound deficits in intelligence  emotional awareness  character  honesty  and fairness. you could not create more pathetic creatures in a lab.
happy that amazon changed their mind with taking on conan. they would have butchered it  tailored him into some woke type of guy and just completely ruined the character. though I look forward to one day someone who just wants to do it for fans and not some political agenda  the way black adam was done. just fun  entertaining  ruthless and all made towards what fans want. something amazon has forgotten to do anymore. I still have the comics of conan I bought in 1990. they have been read but carefully put away in sleeve with my other favorite comics. Im not excited anymore about any movies that is about any of my favorite characters. I just feel they will ruin and disappoint big time. gone are the days when movie makers made movies for fans and to make fans happy. now they call fans trolls  racists and all kinds of names because we are telling them what we want. now they just create movies and series we re not even going to watch  like andor  she-hulk and she-hulk is full on attacking fans. I hope it dies and burns to the ground.
good that it was cancelled  I prefer that to having the character and story destroyed  as a matter of fact the best thing that could happen if it got created is for them to use the actual original stories instead of trying to make new stuff that will just come out as crap
I own the complete works of robert e. howard. Ive read them from cover to cover  and I cantell you first-hand that many of his stories are completely unreadable for  woke  readers. most of his work outside of conan has fallen into obscurity  but he was an extremely prolific writer of short stories and novellas  many of which contain openly and unabashedly racist themes and language. the man was born in texas in 1906  and he had the worldview of a person born in texas in 1906  anyone unwilling or unable to take his day and age into account would do well to avoid his work.
conan was a barbarian
thank God they amazon abandoned it.  with the way they are butchering rings of power I shudder to think of how bad they would destroy or neuter conan.  we dont need another backstory.  if anything the premise should of be a young conan as a thief or on his way to becoming king already well known.  stick with robert e howard s original short stories and make them hour long specials with full violence and nudity.  making the show r rated not woke and diversified.  the pics should be savages  the stygian s some crazy cult people.  etc etc.  the diversity would be their already depending on what part of conan s world he is in example shem.  the woman in conan s world were seductive  passive and warriors.  depending on the strengths of each character. I think netflix would also f it up royally.  you cant make conan a g  pg or pg13 series.  heads and body parts would fly literally women would be naked big shocker..... melonie is referencing he-man and even the creator of that character based it on conan.  they would make conan a side character in his own show not the lead  making an over powered female leading conan around like an oaf.  or similar to inspector gadget where the daughter is always having to save the dumbass father.
I always wondered in these situations  is it alright to rewrite julius ceasars commentariI de bello gallico  with him as a black female  fighting agains asian tribes  but I guess the woman king proves it does...leave the original works alone  you cant and should not try to erase or rewrite history  even if its a fictional work  its what plenty of groups tried to do throughout history  and it never worked out for them...  just look up book burnings throughout history  its essentially the same...
I like to see it.
these people are absolutely obsessed with their religion and must make it absolutely pervasive. its so tired and creatively bankrupt
if I had money I ll go make conan tv show and anime like style of original teen titans or castlevania netflix even avatar
origin story should never deviate from the original  just an oppinion  -  its sad that today s  woke  society is asleep enough to call tough masculinity as  toxic ... and its nauseating what they are doing to most classics. I d love to see ctb series  but definetily not under the producers who think that masculinity is toxic  females should never be potrayed as weak or victims  and every piece of culture should require lgbt addition.... we dont need that kind of conan
conan could be so good with some real money behind it and if you keep modern politics out of it. of course you d have to avoid hiring activists. sadly  we cant have nice things these days.
its all esg that and some weird love of groomers
what about toxic anti-masculine  I cant help but notice that their league of their own series is  well how do I say  not for me...
I guess no red sonja either.
conan rocked in comic. book and movie form. red sonja was absolutely horrible
I disagree with what she said about  only a man can write conan because he is a man . stephen king writes about serial killers and he isn t one. timothy zahn writes amazing star wars characters and he isn t a jedi. j.k. rowling wrote about a little boy wizard and she isn t one. I can do this all day. my point is anyone can write about anything  might not be good but you dont know that until the product is finished.
sorry but arnold schwarzenegger will be the only conan I know.
amazon s man-hater jennifer salke tossed the show-runners  ryan j. condal and miguel sapochnik  of conan who moved on to hbomax to deliver house of the dragon.but jennifer salke wasn t done...  she is responsible for the wheel of time woke catastrophe which was delivered instead of conan.  jennifer salke is the kathleen kennedy of amazon and everything she touches turns to racist man-hate.
well...at least they cant fuck up anything else I love
thanks to the Gods..... I honestly would not survive a woke trans conan wielding a pink buttplug and riding a glittering unicorn. Imean valeria would be the only masculine character in an amazon adaption.
modernizing conan would completely kill the franchise. the main underlining plot to it is the noble savage versus the corruption of civilization. conan is the antithesis to modernity.
truth!!!
Im glad they aren t going be doing a conan show. sorry but I would rather be left with the memory of the awesome conan the barbarian movie and its  toxic masculinity . if they were to make it they would definitely had to stray far from the source material since I am sure they would feel it too  toxic . had they made it I am sure it would be some emo beta surrounded by bigots who would team up with other rejects  insert ethnic sexual stereotype    a mary sue girlboss.
woman u spoke a lot of thruth
they were going to retell conan s origin conan  doesnt have an origin !  he left his boring-ass village in cimmeria because he didn t want to be a boring-ass villager.  and he never went back.  he roams the world of hyperborea searching for gold and pussy  fame and adventure.  aside from the  born on a battlefield  thing his family is never mentioned.  are his folks alive   dont know.  dont care.  does he have siblings  cousins  nieces  nephews   dont know.  dont care.  how hard is that to do
lol the guys who wanted to do a game of thrones-esque franchise using the Lord of rings ip then scraps an actual got-esque fantasy because its too toxic. lmfaoI say hbo try and take hold of conan. if adult swim can do primal they can definitely do conan.
thankfully that abandoned this project as they wouldv e killed my favorite character.
well  as a fellow male of  a certain age  stop whispering boomer in my ear  I can honestly tell you  that we have come a long. long way in terms of male identity and male perception  both in a good and very bad way. it is good that mutual respect and admiration has entered our relation-ships  but it is bad thatstereotypes are assumed to be actual traits of males today. this lead to young men finding it hard to form their self-perception and way of life the men I know  write poems for their love interest  weep in the night if they are turned down and are powerful leaders at the same time.I am one of them   I can honestly tell you  that we  the human race  will only become what we can become  if we help each other  respect each other  listen to each other and above all  love each other.
hiring ppl that cause more damage then good... it all make sense .   maybe karen the destroyer lol
eh  I dont really need a new portrayal of this. new adaptations are temporary d00m is eternal.
men can write women  ripley in aliens was written by a man  she was vulnerable  motherly  and feminine. woke cant write women because they dont know what women are anymore because flamboyant gay men call themselves trans women.
waitso they canceled this sword fantasy show but not that bs lotr   ya done watching movies and shows by them
I love conan but yeah sounds like they would fuck it up. too bad we ll never get a decent adaptation again. I love the original movies with arnie as cheesy as they were.
you think they would try to ride the success from primal
ah  I see. women can have their idol characters representing strong feminist characteristics. but men cannot have their idol characters representing masculinity and manhood. equality at its finest.
its all ok though. everything post howard isn t really conan  its fan fiction.
sounds like amazon should can jennifer salke for toxic femineity
in the books conan is smart speak several languages sometimes he s a thief king of conqueror you know they re strong women too .pirate women wimpy princesses that become strong. he s a clever diplomat and begrudgingly does the right thing  often gets blamed and leaves with hardly no payment. the original books are great and conan is more than just a muscle bound morons swinging a sword.
thanksblackrock
if a bunch of beta s were going to do it and try to overlay their worldview over the mighty thewed cimmerian Im glad they shelved it.
conan stopped for toxic masculinity   its a sword and sorcery genre   yes but its creator wad a feminist   just because the genre  focuses on maculinity  in a amofal world doesnt mean the genres writers hate woman
1 40 its pronounced sapochnik
conan is about him taming a savage world.  romance novels is a women taming savage men.  that is why feminist dont like it.
conan the crimean came out of ucrain    or arrata empire black sea area
youre beautiful and have a beautiful mind!
conan was never my thing  but I get why people like it. its a male power fantasy  like james bond  and like james bond modern hollywood couldn t make a competent version of it.
human flourishing.   alex epstein  s fossil future on sale now.
this is why amazon isn t successful with games  movies or television shows. whether you like it or not  sexy girls and good looking buff guys puts butts on seats. its thatsimple  video games were traditionally played by guys. who were not attracting the cheerleaders  game studio s targeted that audience with what they would like  beautiful strong woman wearing sexy armor and wielding swords. is the armor impractical  of course it is. if you send female soldiers out on the front lines  dressed like that I would be first in line to complain. but we re not  its a fantasy game i.e. not real  and its the same with buff guys topless such as conan. which Ive never heard girls complain about  because again its a fantasy. I think a lot of people cannot grasp fantasy from reality  which says all you need to know about these people. and putting them in charge of entertaining people.....well your not going to make a lot of money.
go on cancel culture! the bolder you feel  the faster you will cancel yourself!
patrice o neal - I generally dont like living in a world where being what a man is  is a horrible thing  and no matter what a women is  is a wonderful thing.
with what amazon did to lotr  I am actually glad they didn t bother with conan. they would have just stripped it of 90  of it and swap it all out for toxic feminist ideologies. stick with the books and comics  unless someone who respects the source material wants to give it a shot.
they didn t want to be a competitor to game of thrones. they wanted to dominate the fantasy market.there is the problem right there. if dominating is the only goal then you are creating a show for the wrong reason. then it is all about ego and nothing about story or entertaining. worry first about just writing and making a good movie  tv show or mini-series. it is fine to set a high bar when doing so. itshould be more about making the best show you can. make a show the audience will like. give them what they want  not what you want them to have. hollywood is not giving us  the audience  what we want. that is why they fail.
I d rather have no conan than a woke conan. I ll just stick to reading the original stories and the pastiches.
you should watch cyberpunk   edgerunners  its a breath of fresh air
considering those movies had sex slavery   are filled from head to toe with meathead masculinity fun  there is no way in a billion years it would have been made today. unless of course they made conan a black woman   made it about racism. so this doesnt remotely surprise me. Im surprised they even considered it in the first place.this is ok with me. I like conan   dont have to watch as something else I enjoy gets ruined by modern wokeist ideology.
if they re woke agenda was so great they could create a brand new story  right   it would stand on its own  right   no need for the recurring  remake crutch right
you cant wokefy teh conan   look at marvel comics conanImean  you can. it just turns into shit  like everything else the woke touches.
to be honest writing is not a gender dependent job. unless  if you wish to write about a life copying story of a person the gender  skin color  and race of the writer is not relevant.
yes! its because rings of power failed!
yeah Im happy amazon dropped conan. with their stupid politics these days there is no way they could faithfully put out a solid conan show. I think it would wind up like the new he-man...which is just...so bad. the fact thatsocial commentary comes before good story telling is just...awful. hell as hyper masculine as conan is my sister would love to see them faithfully make something of it. we both agree though that right now  its just not possible. maybe if you had a writer company that gave zero fucks about social commentary and just makes a good story.
this show would have been hilariously awful and fun to point and laugh at. too bad.
subscribed.
masculinity is not toxic and itseems the world has given men a new hill to live on.
they would be better off doing groo the wanderer  on second thought  they would ruin that too.
there is no way they could stay true to source material. if conan cant fuck itsteal it eat it or kill it he isn t interested. feminists would literally explode.
lotr the series thatstarted so much in the fantasy world  now is meh. wheel of time  too me one of the greatest fantasy epics every written and is double meh. the great thing is  given enough time this can all be redone later. it worked for peter jackson  which yes I know  they are not perfect  but neither was got. remember when all we had was labyrinth  legend and time bandits  and that animate version of lotr that was quite possible the slowest series of movies ever made. dont give me wrong  I love all of these  but we  as consumers were clinging to  the princess bride .  now the entertainment industry is spending a billion dollars on one show. what I am saying is that its good conan got cancelled  before it could get cancelled. the pendulum is going to swing the other way  society is going to chill out a little bit. then we can fix some of this shit. in other words  let s just be a little bit patient. for instance  now room for  woke  anything in warhammer 40k. henry cavil trying to make that happen  not sure how that will play out  but that universe is so large it will be really easy to pivot away from mistakes. again  we wait  we let this shitself implode  and they we fix it.
great video.arnold where the heck are you  !
how in the world does amazon get amazing shows like reacher or term list in  but panders so much to the woke stuff  I just dont know what bezos  plan is. is he going to cancel the aforementioned series now because its for  maga extremists  or something
2022 hollywood playbook  take a beloved property  replace everything cool about it with woke propaganda  spend a ton of money telling everyone its groundbreaking  blame the original fans when it fails.
the fact that they would even consider letting a woman write a conan series is beyond repulsive. conan is about the most dangerous  dirty  bold  and uncompromising aspects of masculinity. its not meant to be clean  morally justifiable all the time even. its just supposed to be awe inspiring  and badass.I dont need some woman trying to give her approximation of what she perceives raw masculinity as  or trying to change or distort it. she s a woman  she lacks the core experiential understanding. a show like this would require a very ballsy  masculine male writer. anything less would miss the entire point of conan as a character.
the problem conan is you have idiots that would just love to woke it up because it is full of toxic masculinity.one thing that is very persistent in the original hardware stores and has gone into the adaptations by marvel and dark horse is that conan will not take a woman by force.he never has the only time he chased out for a woman with lust was atalI the frost giants daughter.the stories of conan are constantly of a guy that is doing things and not because he s a Christian values guy but because he wants women money and drink. he does things though because he does have a barbarian coat of honor of protecting the weak but still he expects to be paid.one final factor in the conan stories is the idea of civilization versus barbarism he has come across friends and foes that thinking because he s a barbarian and they are civilized that they are better than him but in the end conan shows that civilization does not mean that youre better than him.our barbarian does not kill women in children or the infirm civilized people they ll have no problem doing that and as can be seen in game of thrones thatseem to be the norm.
its funny cause we keep going on about how netflix is the woke one but really its not even close.
...amazon would have had 10 minutes of conan  who would be portrayed as a macho idiot ....and then the rest of the season would have had some non binary empowered female  mary sue  save the world....yeah  just as well amazon doesnt poo all over our cherished  conan the barbarian  movie!
sooner or later if a hetero man moves on screen in a strong way  it ll be deemed too toxic.
wth  there s nothing toxic about conan. have these morons never read a conan book or comic  he only chooses powerful females as mates. he s actually very intelligent   doesnt just go running in   hacking things to pieces. he learns from his companions   is constantly diversifying his worldview   skills. he s someone with strong sense of justice   honor. yes he s a  barbarian  by modern standards but he would be considered a good man by any   all modern standards thatstill allow men to be masculine. its also very disingenuous given that reacher got greenlit   is very very much the same character. there s even a bit in the second or third episode where he tries to  protect  the female cop  spectacularly well written with fears   struggles but still exceedingly capable    she gets pissed with him saying  Im not some damsel that needs saving.  the show very much gives a fairly positive spin to masculinity   writes the female   minority characters as real people not stereotypes.God Im so disheartened by liberals falls prey to acceptance of the fringe as most conservatives are of republican politicians acceptance of the alt-right. we re allowing the crackpots to run the asylum.
I want to see the woke conan.  he s a black man  who s an activist feminist  probably a gay guy too.  abhor s violence  tries to change the world through interpretive dance.
its gotten to the point I dont even want to watch mainstream movies or shows because of all the   virtue    cough fake virtue cough   cultural reprogramming being done. we have been writing stories for the last 1000-plus years with very similar and well-understood archetypes....... Im sorry this trend in the last 20 -50 years will not last and will eventually self-destruct.
only a male     dripping 180 proof testosterone that has won a lot of fights can properly write a conan story  .I am not trying to diminish women    but how can anyone write a story about someone that they dont understand at all
and I thought the conan w  jason mamoa was bad! an amazon version would be horrendous! just say no!
a harmless man is not a good man. a good man is a very  very dangerous man who has it under voluntary control.jordan b. peterson denouncing masculine oppression feminist scream and protest against the policy of regarding women as  sex objects - through speakers who  too obviously  are in no such danger. ayn randhard times create strong men.strong men create good times.good times create weak men  and  weak men create hard times.g. michael hopf
damn  conan was totally full of the most racially diverse fantasy sidekicks  villains and local leaders of both sexes ever. great opportunity for diverse actors missed out. uh   toxic  masculinity in your way. I absolutely love conan universe for trolling snowflakes. it makes snowflakes cry since 1982. everybody knows only some ex govenor of california. the robert e. howards books are stellar great storytelling for sword   sorcery pulp fiction.
usually they just gender swap... then its not toxic.  s
hollywood woke treatments of conan begin with the pathetic miliius movie in 1982. I saw it in the theater as a kid  and being raised on the original robert e. howard stories  I nearly walked out in disgust. for example  the reh conan would have died before submitting to slavery  and the scene where conan snivels at the feet of his  master  is repulsive. milius burdens his version of conan with a parade of boring sidekicks that only serve to dilute howard s singular character. with the ongoing debate concerning  respect for the lore  surrounding tolkien and rings of power  there was never any question that milius crapped all over the source material from howard. milius  ridiculous  origin  story for conan  betrays his infantile tendency to account for every shade of ambiguity  rather than deal with the complex  dark  enigmatic  mysterious conan created by howard. I understand that people have affection for the milius movie  and thats fine. I suppose its a serviceable fantasy flick  but it has nothing to do with conan. call it fred the barbarian. just dont call it conan. the milius conan would piss his diapers if confronted by the reh conan.
thank  crom.
I haven t watched a hollywood movie in years because they are all now pc crap that has lost their pure entertainment value and have all gotten some message they are trying to push. Im not interested in the message  I just want to be entertained. there is no entertainment value in being lectured to and being told Im racist because I find that crap boring  and I am not afraid to say it is boring crap with no artistic value  that is lazily written  badly acted and not relevant to non-americans  who seem too afraid to speak their minds without a backlash. I dont care what the colour or sex of the actor actress is  if it is a well written  entertaining movie  but if it is some piece of crap with a message and agenda they are trying to push  then nope  not interested.
yeah  I hate using the terms  woke  and  wokify.    as the way you use them  melonie. you continue to misunderstand what  woke  means. it has nothing to do with characters being politically incorrect. being woke is a good thing. it means being awakened to cultural and ethnic injustices inflicted on minorities by societal systems. what you are talking about is inclusion  inclusiveness   or ethnic and cultural diversity. so you should stop misusing  woke  to mean these terms. but I suppose as usual you  and most of your audience here  will prefer to be too lazy to educate yourselves and continue misusing  woke.    by the way  Im a big fan or conan and red sonja and many other sword and sorcery characters  for decades now. conan is toxically masculine and thats one thing I love about him. he makes me laugh sometimes because he s an extreme case. yet he is not entirely toxic. he often demonstrates his tender and compassionate sides.
@melonie mac go boom what other books series  you dont want to have a hollywood spin on
pheeewwww.... dodged that bullet!!!
today it would be a female conan
thank God
why not try using  red sonja for a show
the secret  of steel! no one in this world can yo utrust  not women  not men  not beasts. this you cantrust.
yes  amazon can stay the hell away from conan.  they ve butcherer too many good stories already.
let me make thatshit  I ll make itsuper toxic....and people would love it. lol
we will never see him back  wont we  ok  I understand it might be for the best.
house of the dragon showrunners were gonna do a conan show damn  I ll miss out on all the nonsensical lecturing about  man bad  mkay  how shall I live without that
honestly  I dont want amazon fucking with it anyway.  glad to hear it.
would have loved a good conan but amazon probably would have ruined it  they did a great job with reacher and chris pratt s terminal list but rings of power is so bad.
red sonia is a nice movie
amazon also fucked up the wheel of time
oh we know have ya seen the death of the rings
so I have a question  we are always hearing about  toxic masculintiy this and toxic masculinity that .... is it possible for anything nowadays to be masculine and not considered toxic
love your tats
tomboys!
the reason nothing is getting better is because hollywood makes movies for hollywood  their all high on each other s farts. look what amazon did to the wheel of time  and rings of power. then take a look at something they just threw out  reacher  that was great. its time woke came to a end because its done so much damage I cant even watch something that even hints of woke now  so its done nothing but damage to female actors and directors for quite some time.
sounds like its a good thing that they cancelled the project.  they would have ruined it and taken away from what and who conan really is.  they would have emasculated him.  that is not the kind of show I would watch.
huh...  market dominance  sounds like toxic masculinity
yeah... talking more helps aye!  lol
this is the true face of efinism  pure misandry.
conan exiles  get it. play it. hear the lamentation of the women
Im happy we at least get a jack reacher season 2.I just hope they dont turn him gay...
at least we didnt have to see conaneesha
go boom
lol. sometimes you sound like the vancome lady.
Im writing a new style comic book series. its about sheman super sudete  that realizes she is actually a man. and follows a different path to super heroness. lol xoxo...
dont these people know any other words  everything is  toxic  this   toxic  that...
maybe the  h  is silent
Im kind of glad. it would have been horrible anyway.
from my understanding  they sold the rights to netflix. not that I have any confidence in them making it good. Imean  they already destroyed the witcher.
generally amazon should not touch anything that has an existing fan base.make something completely new  using your new script writers and ideology. make it for what you think are your customer base is. let itstand on its own merits and originality. ....
the can call him wokenon
isn t netflix doing a conan tv show after amazon passed on it oh ps... amazon s ring of power sucks.
its for the best.they would have ruined it.
I hate that I live in the decade of garbage movies   series. I wonder which decade will start making good movies again.
they scraped sneaky pete which was really funny and a good show. they cancel everything and replace it with absolute shit now.
no  by crom! I ll not dance like a puppet for some witch-woman who s prophesied my death!
Im sorry  unrelated  but how do you do your hair  cause I have curls too and they never look that nice lol
amazons  newest series  bonan the librarian  a soyboy librarian on his pursuit of overdue books
how about you let a man write and direct conan and let a woman write and direct a red sonja and see where that goes. dames goes for he-man and she-ra
amazons hating men aint notn new lmao
they want masculine women and feminine men. buy physical copies of old shows and movies that you like. buy physical copies of books that you enjoy.
we are now getting toxic womenculinity and wokeculinity.
so what s your onlyfans
how about turning poisen ivy obese
dope sleeve
the new do  very do  much do. nice do.
conan is a masculine character... destroying that and turning him into anything else its not conan anymore.
remember red sonya
checking boxes - Im hearing more and more of that all the time. all you end up is a smaller talent pool and poorer writing.
good.
by crom! the woke serpents need the axe!
remember the days when women use to think they were a mercedes but now think they re a beat up chevy covered in bumper stickers.
m I l I u s
conan is better on netflix not amazon
pick me  please  3 I like men teehee
screw the rings of power. elirc of melnibone would topple everything
aye-n-her-ahr
what a shocker one of the biggest companies run by one of the biggest nerds hate strong men
start calling them  the elect . jon mcwhorter makes the case that they are a religion and we must treat them as such.
the plot ligne is not good.happy they re not doing it.
conan dodged a fucking bullet as far as Im concerned.
didn t conan s mom take up a spear and fight to save her husband then he was born on the battle field  is that not woke enough for them now   sorry in advanced if you said this in the video... I heard they needed to change it and I thought pregnant woman spearing people was metal as fuck!  also I need to say that as a woman  I always liked the women in conan lore because shit wasn t given to them. they had to exist in a society that for the most part hated them and in that they had to work hard for respect and push through an actual patriarchy in most cases... the women warriors in conan were real  strong women  or at least a depiction of what one might be.
ernherjar  ern her yar  are the immortal warrior dead of valhalla.
jan 1  2028conan becomes public domain.  6 more years until anyone can write true to source material conan stories.
all needs said
dude the reality is this is what happens when you let feminism get out of control they start bashing on us for no reason conan s a good show it just advertises and is for a different generation there s no reason why women today should have a problem with a show that was made over 30 years ago nor should they have a problem with it being remade today if they are then they re sexist its thatsimple
my God you are cute as a button.
pretty sure they scrapped it cause they suck at making movies and tv  so we should all be happy.
wait why dont they just gender swap itseems so much easier these days to do that or what about them just making red sonja
movie plot  cultural marxists fall into a portal   end up in the world of conan. they scream reeeeeeeeeee   conan cuts of their blue haired heads thinking they are harpies that must be slayed.
netflix could do conan justice  top gun maverick is toxic and look at the      it made. just need the right production that doesnt give a flip and a streamer which likewise doesnt care about the small vocal minority
they ruined wheel of time  just like disney ruined willow.
they will lose money and corpos only understand money language
people should focus on making great shows that entertain people and not play out the producers political desires this is how you make money  although very different from the books the original conan movie did this. a series following the books would be great but unfortunately watering down the story because you might offend a few people would create trash  there is a reason some art endures centuries its because its good...the mush is soon forgotten.
without men  were dead.....
good. good thing they did scrap conan because I dont want them touching it.
they already ruin conan in the 2011 remake movie before even the woke age.
wait what cartoon is she talking about! !
number 1  they ll make conan black  and gay. 2 they ll call it conan but red sonja will be the main  they ll shave the side of her head and make her latina  and she definitely wont be a red head any more.
what cartoon is she talking about
lol nobody is destroying masculinity
Im not even sad  Im relieved. modern adaptations are almost always garbage  because they never stick to the spirit of the original work.
these are great news. nothing in prime has quality. lol house of the dragon  the show where they can rape and everybody is ok with it.
a certain cartoon  what conan cartoon
he man
he-man cartoon
@melonie mac go boom  I actually thought Imissed a conan cartoon thanks. I thought new cgI he-man was better.
better to been cancelet than new tv show with independent woman red sonja type of woman called  conan the barbarian woman
I just realized you are not an amazon. you were just talking about a corporation -__-
what s wrong with tomb raider
meetoo needs to end for good
they wouldn t be happy unless they could turn it into conan of africa  the trans-barian.
looks like tv people not reading the source materials again and just making broad assumptions based on their own prejudices.
oh....I heard that they were going to make conan a woman....hmmmm....lol
they would make conan non-binary or gay.
other than the prequel series to game of thrones out now I think hollywoke has been able to ruin every.single. series. and movie they ve touched in the last decade.
so amazon absolutely nails the boys  and invincible... then they hire this  karen  and fuck up their entire line of shows. sounds like absolute win over there.I love the wheel of time books  but the show was top-tier mediocre at its best. in no way was it adult  either. these streaming platforms are killing themselves.
ever since 2020 everything s the wb.  when my kids get older we ll just sit around and watch reruns I guess I trust a new game of thrones people they re the only people that had a good show this year. all the woke writers in hollywood suck
conan the non-binarian
I agree  I rather they abandonthe project entirely than make conan another victim of the woke generation.Im so sick of hollywood b       . like Im all in support of diversity but hollywood is just doing it wrong.
let them remake conan  they will fail at that too. and just like rop it will be confined to the ash pile of history and largely forgotten.
go watch  deadwood   because   men bad  really bad  !
I just like to say what happened to the days of he-man and she-ra you know the good shit that wasn t trying to be fake woke out the ass and just so all of you know my aunt angel loved watching thundercats he-man and conan the barbarian remember I said aunt my father s sister a female watched guy shows and liked it just saying that wasn t such a thing as this toxic masculinity bullshit in the original  80s cartoons where you had both strong male and female characters that work together to fight the forces of evil and even conan had female supporting characters along with male supporting characters to help him fight in the show conan the adventurer when he fought against wrath of all he had jasmine by his side just spitting some conan facts by the way also to prove my point give us the shit we want to see use the comics use the source material if youre going to do something do it right fucking disney and amazon ruining all the good shit
mamoas conan movie was the best. fight me
rule number one for companies. dont hire activist. they will destroy your company. rule numerr 2  see rule number one. and so forth and so forth and so froth. even mr miago knew this basic rule. maybe thats why the show cobra kaI is so successful. oh
go watch primal  that will wash the tast of soy that amazon left from your fantasy.great and underrated show.
good leave conan alone.
try watching primal
wish they d just focus on making content that just grabs you by the pooper and yells buckle up buttercup we going for a ride!! not bs id politics
amazon scraps conan becau- dont even care why  just happy its canned.mel is of course right again  anything the media touches turns to shit  therefore them scrapping a conan sequel or remake  even for idiotic and bigoted reasons  is still good. the last thing we need is woke morons touching the works of robert e. howard.
the thing that irritates me is the need to weaken the men. like a woman character cant be capable without incapable men. bad writing. luke skywalker and han solo did different jobs. leah could have done something useful without making them null and void. conan had grace jones.
thanks amazon for telling us masculinity is  toxic .
not sure if its men bad thing. considering all of the b-rated old fantasy and 80 s sex comedies they have on it. but Im glad they are not doing conan. I just hope they never get elric.
hollywood needs to drop all this sjw bs for movies they just need to ship it out and have movies made in other countries like japan would make a damn good connan movie I bet. hollywood has no creativity left its all dead. thy have to and need to watch the og connan and stick to what worked in it and stay true to that macho man who can do what he wants when he wants. they pulled back on it in the second movie and thats why it didn t do as well.
thank God they cancelled elric of melnibone
when they say clean up the culture what they mean is convert it forcefully  ...kind of sounds like what the crusaders did the middle ages  ...
thank God.  they would have ruined it.
hollyweird ruins everything I grew up most of my life in japan and I started watching american films when Imarried my husband.  america made excellent films from the 1930s to 1990s but I noticed a big trend when these companies started ruining stories and making remakes and rehashed films that didn t need them.  I love the classic 1933 king kong but the remakes and retellings are God awful.  I dont understand why they are making these poor decisions.  I gave up on disney star wars because its not magical to me anymore its like they pushing gender politics and other crap.I want to escape through movies not be reminded how bad reality it!glad they wont be ruining conan they damaged enough films these days!
huh!!! like really  I agree with most of what was mentioned from the original creator who posted about this. you and so many others basically copy pasted his words to the tee and are trying to pass it off as your own. does originality mean anything to you people  I d give you some kind of credit if anything you said was original. I will you credit for having as many subs as you do  congrats.
I already canceled my netflix because of their toxic femininity - this sounds ridiculous as I type it  but so is toxic masculinity  so Im keeping it. amazon is shaping up to be my next cancel.
Jesus your super smh..I cant subscribe for the wrong reasons..lol
glad they didn t make the series.I dont have any interest in watching the heroics of his big sister connana.
...aren t amazons women...
they are racists not us.they are the ones who care about color and gender.nobody I know is a racist or could care less about somebody else business. I treat all assholes equally.
conan the barbarian  is one of my favorite characters . thank God I dont want those woke morons to fuck conan up. red sonja was created by a man and so was wonder woman. remember anything woke turns to shit . good video thank you.
origin 8s a code word for schlock and garbage
hey. you good option for woman I like much
im so glad they drop it.. someday all this crap they doing will die then they will bring back stories like conan and others.
people just stop spending your money and stop being curious and it will all go away. money talks...dont watch these woke remakes on streaming  dont go to theater to see some stupid remake or gender race swapped film.stop going  stop giving it free advertising making videos complaining about it and it will go away.
what cartoon are you talking about
God Im so happy amazon did. because it would have ended up a leftie   the message  piece of shit that would have done like the last dr strange movie did and made him a supporting role etc.
would ve been shitty no matter what.
let s not kid ourselves. an amazon conan show would be a plate of hobo shit anyway.
I like you
it is what it is  all men are bad I get it but why continue to date men then  its weird  Im more curious on what the next  movement  is going to be.
pretty much every show and movie sucks ass now. its so sad. Imiss the 80s and 90s.
I consider that a bullet dodged. hollywood already try to remake it. itsucked  just leave it alone.
the main problem with modern movie game tvshows all the enterteining industry is. that they not create for fandom and people who love the stories not being tha part of fandoms of all awesome franchise. but for woke lgbt feminist freaks full of bullsh8t. nobody want forced diversity  equality and representation. insted of making great new stories and memories. they destroy the old ones we loved so much.
this will fail so bad  not watching it for shore
destruction of your enemies....see them drivin before you...and to hear the lamentation of the women.....
I am sure they will turn him gay and he will rescue soy boys. can you say bros 2
conan should be a women....
lolz what the hell nothing is good anymore.
didnt conans tribe make great weapons through smithing  and his village was destroyed over it  doesnt seem mindless to me    a different society doesnt mean mindless ugh im so sick of real life things changing everything and claiming to be inclusive ....thats not how that works yo
so what I dint get with all of these silly flim flam flip swap switcha roes is this.  if you dont like conan because he s a toxic masculine character why not make red sonja  red sonja to white   cool make a movie show about zula. you could also make a how movie about the wizard from conan he was a cool character or if you want a strong black male lead make a movie about seth from the beast master   all Im saying is they have a vast wealth of old characters or they could make new characters. just saying
conan would have no chance... they would make him gay and black and a woman in the show would order him about and be a better warrior than he is. lol lucky escape  a franchise they wont ruin.
toxic masculinity....with conan the fucking barbarian   let me repeat the main part there  barbarian!  these idiots are out of their mind.  Im so tired of this shit continually being created for the minority  instead of the majority.  it also keeps being created by people that have no clue about the content of the characters or even care.  so lets see what we have left if you take conan and remove his size muscles and rage drive to survive....you sure as fuck dont have anyone that would be able to live through and of the monsters conan has had to make it through.  as far as the director for wonder woman.  sure  it worked for her  because you have a woman directing about a woman super hero.  how in any way does that mean thatshe will automatically be amazing for all other categories of movies.  bill burr has an amazing joke about some women that have written article for men  making itsound like they know what its like to be a male.  he says its like if he was to write a book telling women what its going to be like when they are pregnant.
toxic masculinity is just masculinity that benefits men and not women...
so  they only wanted effeminate muscular men on screen  what kind of torture is that  the matriarch totally humiliates men.
you all have 4 years at best.
they probably would have made conan into a trans woman
too bad they ruined he-man and she-ra and g.I joe and etc because they re dead to me.good they left conan untouched and undestroyed.thank you amazon for not destroying conan.
again if this movement is so woke they should have the creativity to make new characters not retcon old ones. it is unoriginally lazy and insulting to fans.
one bit of constructive criticism - as a content creator  in order to be taken seriously make sure to know how to pronounce the names in the article on which you are reporting.  I almost turned away.  I am glad I did not since I enjoyed your video.  but I almost didn t.
good...because if they did ruin it  in the words of thulsa dhum   infidel defilers  they shall all drown in rivers of blood
I just learned when prime content catalogue turned into lame boring uncontroversial mainstream crap.
somehow Ive found myself on the edgeLord side of yt again.  where s the fucking exit
but butchering  a league of their own  to be a complete  lgbt fest is fine by amazon standards....
conan is toxic masculinity. as itshould be. amazon scrapping this project is good news. netflix gave us the punisher  so there s hope there I think.
sjw epstein democrats said orange man bad.
pronan the soytarian  no one is interested. Im glad they didn t do it.
shame that  wheel of time  sucks so bad....
look  no just no. this had nothing to do with woke   its the same stupid executives that gave us the last conan remake monstrosity. we dont want remakes  origin storie  etc. the only thing we want is old conan  and only with arnold schwartzenegger. no one remembers the barbarians movie why  because it wasn t arnold  it wasn t story driven.
toxic masculinity  I would think pushing men not to be men or a man trying to be a woman would be considered toxic masculinity.
damn...I remember when  meloniemac use to be a good person.  who thought years later she make a video that minorities cant be elves or making videos for incels like these. lol
it is good that amazon didn t touch conan the barbarian or they would create as shity show as they did with rings of shit.
oh  and conan is not a simple power fantasy...its the days of high adventure!
ok we canceling tv show for toxic masculinity what about toxic femininity  kardashians  is that toxic  for young girls or what is  just joking
eh  they would have fucked up the show anyways.
w.o.k.ewahmenonlyknoweverythingie  a bunch of lies.
im on the left and im sick of this woke shit
close call. their conan would have been black or hawaiian or a purple-haird trans-they them
what next  a black dwarf woman portraying a dwarf in an old world fantasy story    oh wait....
she ruined wot. the show should be deleted. I am happy they passed on conan.
almost all shows and movies being made these days are garbage  particularly in comparison to what came before. I ll stick to that.
let men be men... stop all the bs
I think conan should be cast as a gay black woman with  issues .afteral that is where hollywood is goingno one cares about the new woke versions. we just ignore them and remember the original version
dont f up conan! theres red sonya they can destroy! women have no problem tearing down other women!
I tried watching the wheel of time  and as soon as I saw that it was just more woke shit  I stopped watching it.
thank God. they would probably have made him trans and black
114 500
this sucks. Im gonna go watch my favourite rebooted media featuring a female main character  lupin iii
ok here comes the rant. Im glad amazon wont be ruining conan. but Im pretty pissed off at the same time. you mean tk tell me there is a strong conan script out there that is true to robert e. howard s original stories  but it got scrapped because some dumb activist who doesnt even like fantasy came in and called in toxic masculinity  what a shame. conan would be exactly what amazon needed. look at their woke fantasy shows  wheel of time  rings of power. flops. audience scores 60-38 . thats not good. look at their hyper masculine shows  reacher  the terminal list. people freaking loved those shows. people are tired  especially men are tired of being told we re garbage for being manly. conan is a hero. he saves people from evil sorcerers  monsters and all kinds of other disgusting things. he takes pity on the downtrodden. read the heart of the elephant and tell me conan is a bad perso or toxicly masculine. ugh  idiots.
sadly the wheel of time wasn t spared. and it is a misandrist shit-show.
its fine  we didn t need a non binary trans lesbian conan to begin with.
being bigoted against 49  of your potential customer base isn t smart business  imho.
they just need to recast conan as a lesbian.  problem solved.
they cancelled conan. thank God. we dont need their version of a soy-infused cimmerian.
they d have made him an african-americantransexual if they had made it  so no great loss.
conan is highly overrated
everything now days is crap. just a bunch of woke goes broke crap. marvel  rings of power  house of the dragon  dc  I can go on for days.
good! amazon shouldn t touch conan! I want original r.e.h. conan  not  the conan reh could have written  buy would not have . I want unapologetic  unashamed masculinity from conan. not a woke lecture  or a political message.
amazon would make conan a black asian quad-queer  2 spirit furry  blind wheel chair riding  trans-woman  who cries about climate change  global warming  rising sea levels and covid!
the remake was awful more like pirates of the caribbean. arnold schwarzenegger is the only connan.zena warrior is toxic femininity!
I was looking forward to the black latino asian gay trans feminist vegansjw conan with gender neutral pronouns.
you mean I wont get to see conan cast as an obese  amputee  lesbian  green haired black woman  how will I cope with such a disappointment.
thank God they dumped it! gay conan and lesbian red sonja  who s married to a black trans dude  would have been awful.
big fan of the conan books  not much of a fan of the movies.nice click bait with no proof just accusations. what s funny and sad is you say that a woman can write a male character and a man can write a female character. then soon after that you say a woman shouldn t write the conan character.good job getting view by being a hypocrite. grow up and do something productive other than selling hate.
lol  that was priceless! and so very true.....look what they did to the Lord of the rings series they tried
