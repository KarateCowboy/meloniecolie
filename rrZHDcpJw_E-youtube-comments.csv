a harmless man is not a good man.  a good man is a very  very dangerous man who has that under voluntary control.   -jordan peterson
my oldest daughter  now 23  a few years ago said  dad I want a guy like you. you ve always treated mom awesome  you work hard and you dont take crap from anyone.  thats one of the biggest compliments Ive ever gotten from anyone. I came into my daughter s life when she was 13 when her mom and I first started dating.
I find itso hypocritical that modern society shrieks about how you cant tell a woman what being a woman is or should be but then they turn around and tell men what a man should be. we shouldn t be shaming people for their sex we should be shaming them for their toxicity. its not toxic masculinity femininity  its just toxicity.
you can not always trust what the press say . wow melonie  thats the understatement of the decade! take an upvote from me!
God I love sam elliot. he and his mustache are national treasures.
masculinity is good for men s psychology not bad. I love how our culture embraces and empowers women for any type of woman they want to be but men are increasingly getting boxed in to an ever changing checklist
Im so tired of the west putting down masculinity like its a bad thing. masculinity is a good thing it teaches young men responsible and character. westerns embody that like john wayne and clint eastwood.
as a texan   I completely approve of your proper pronunciation of the word  western .
as soon as I hear the term  toxic masculinity   I stop thinking about abusive dad s  and immediately think about a hard working father who s skeptic about what the news says while dealing with his obnoxious teenage daughter who s crying that he wont let her take his car to drive her prom date.half of the time Im rooting for traits that get called toxic.  when wokies cant tell the difference between confidence and overconfidence  I tune them out.
Ive been reading westerns by zane grey since I was 7 8 years old then louis l  amour when I was older. to me the quintessential cowboy was actors like john wayne  clint eastwood and sam elliott. even the old western tv shows had cowboys who showed the grit and strength these people had.trump never admits he lost  but its fine that hillary hasn t quit denying she lost for 6 years.
this doesnt sound like a  western  so much as itsounds like a romance novel written for an odd mixture of yaoI fangirls and women over 60.
I confess that I came across your channel quite by accident and Im glad I did. while I enjoy the bulk of your content  the fact that you include a brief moment in each video to share some of the gospel with your viewers is wonderfully uplifting! I know it ll be a blessing to you  he is faithful to those who are faithful to him.
my issue is people messing with time periods and trying to put today s climate in the past. in 1925 montana  people weren t talking about masculinity and how  bad  it is. people also weren t talking about sexuality either. its the equivalent of people talking about gender and diversity in a medieval middle ages epic.
when masculinity dies  so does nobility .toxic masculinity is a gross generalization. its essentially lumping toxic characteristics of men with noble characteristics. toxic behavior should be corrected and noble behavior should be encouraged.
Imean western regularly touches deep themes. peckinpah is a director that did westerns that deal with violence and corruption. according to  wikI   his characters are often loners or losers who desire to be honorable but are forced to compromise in order to survive in a world of nihilism and brutality. he was given the nickname  bloody sam  owing to the violence in his films.
preach sister!  I love seeing this come from a woman. we need more like you using your platform to get us back to reality.
the good  the bad and the ugly has always been one of my favorites. love all the old eastwood westerns. God bless melonie.
you ve mentioned how you enjoy rock music  so if you haven t heard it yet  I would like to recommend the last stand by sabaton. its a historical song about the swiss guard protecting the pope during the sacking of rome in the 1500s. great song with a kind of religious feel to it.
I agree sam elliot is a true cowboy!!! I grew up watching westerns with my dad  rip . thats what westerns were turned up masculinity. I use to be a ranch hand  riding horses and caring for live stock and operating tractors was awesome!!!
the story explodes  genuinely had me laugh aloud. thank you.
that is one fine quote  from a man a lot more young men need to listen to.
you did good. dammit I would want a guy like you if I was into guys. lol
my stepdad was ten times the man that my father is. my stepdad came into my life when I was 10 years old  Ive always looked up to him and aspired to be like him. my stepdad will always be my real dad.
do you have any children of your own
stepdaughter
no actual children of your own though. rip to your bloodline and you got used by the mother. what a shame  never got to experience the joys of seeing your own baby.
ironically enough the  cant tell a woman what being a woman is or should be  part only seem to apply when the women in question fall in line and follow whatever society s idea of what a woman should actually be is that day. Ive lost count of the stories I see where people get their pants in a massive twist because someone actually likes being a housewife and stay at home while the man works. and since I have friends who are into kinky stuff  being a woman and submissive means you ve been brainwashed by the patriarchy  that you dont really want this and that the man is somehow forcing you into this  despite the bdsm community being all about consent and playing safe. so it looks to be more of a  you cant tell a woman what being a woman is or should be  as long as she sticks to the accepted mainstream idea of what a woman should be  thing  something that comes across as hilariously hypocritical to me.
@paradoxdelapaladino  you didn t read the whole thing  did you
@sassy ghost  I did. the phrases toxic masculinity and toxic feminist have a place and are for certain behaviors related to those concepts. just saying  toxic  does aptly describe those behaviors.
@paradoxdelapaladino  ok. I can see your point.
@sassy ghost  I really like your name btw. it made me laugh.
@paradoxdelapaladino  thank you! it came from a joke my friend and I had that whoever dies first has to haunt the other and she told me I d be sassy ghost who would pull poltergeist pranks for giggles.
@sassy ghost  omg
yes sassy ghost you are corrext yes yes yes yes yes yes yes tes yes yes yes
true. his mustache should be on our money.
he s a hoot on parks and rec too.
I can never remember the name  but I always remember that deep voice and the mustache.
@daniel gamache  yessir
I loved sam elliot in road house. I bet he ate small meals on set  after all the scenery that he chewed  -
you bet yer bottom dollar!
sam elliott and pee-wee herman should have been in a western together.
one point  current society does not want to permit women to take a traditional feminine role  and ridicules those that make that choice.
@axel smith  exactly this
@tribal blood  oof oooo nooo man hahaha

hard times can create strong people. strong people bring about change. bringing change can create easier times. easier times can create weaker people. weaker people will bring harder times. its a whole cycle. I feel like we re in a phase where easy times have created weak people who feel too safe  too comfortable and therefore anything seen as tough  rough and or masculine can be seen as unnecessary and  problematic . thats where the woke people go wrong. we must maintain real masculinity amongst our men and keep people in general strong so that we re not trampled over and easily controlled. although I also believe we re approaching a time when hard times will create strong people and that we re on the brink of bringing about change  however that may play out.
confidence and cockiness
sam made great points in his interview beyond the sexual stuff  you had a women from urban new zealand telling a story about a culture  the american rural west  thatshe is 100  clueless about especially in a historical context.
its as anachronistic as them talking about surfing the web on their smartphone.
that movie is a timeless masterpiece.
sabaton songs are like history crib notes
if youread his entire interview he talks about spending the last several months in rural texas with real cowboys and men who work for a living  he grew up that way himself around mollala oregon. he felt that movie was an insult to all those hardworking people.
r.i.p. sorry for your loss
@lauren masters  thank you
also  when it comes to westerns  unforgiven is awesome. for that matter  the quick and the dead and silverado are good fun  and trinity is still my name is hilarious.
a great western that does have something to say about masculinity is john ford s  the man who shot liberty valence.  john wayne and jimmy stewart  a hell of a film.
right  westerns are supposed to be like what john wayne and clint eastwood used to be in.
the comments section  plus your commentary  is encouraging.  we  Im a fan of frontier flicks as well  see that westerns show and promote some ideal manly values that pushers of the message want to do away with.
1883 is a really really good series. the main character is female but I dont really think its overly woke or anything. I think its still good western series. there were old movies that had strong female characters as well  so I think its still along those lines.
I like your thoughts on masculinity and how masculine men  who are often painted as the problem  are often some of the best people to  be around. being a part of gun culture I can say the same thing about  gun nuts . responsible gun owners are often the nicest people to be around and are happy to educate and bring new people into the fold.
my favorite westerns are  the outlaw josey wales  tombstone  they call me trinity  rio bravo  unforgiven  and the original true grit.
you hit it right on the head   trying to turn us into amorphous blobs. . people dont mention it as much as 1984  but you should check out we by zamyatin. literally predicted thatsort of abomination years before orwell
its about destroying what a human is. part of it means changing gender roles and creating a chaos between the body and the mind. people who know who they are and what their purpose is aren t easy to control.
I appreciate the effort you task into these issues.  I am frustrated in the confusion in world our grandchildren are forced to navigate.  your thoughts here are great and will come better into focus over time  if our society has any time left to survive.  for many people  it takes years of exploring and sharing these thoughts  along with effective mentorship  to really get a good grasp on what will positively impact others around you.the basics are this  male-female relationships are difficult  and they are supposed to be  if they were easy  they would be kinda useless and we d never learn anything from them.  strong men can only be strong  when they have strong women around them.  strong women can only be strong  when their men have the confidence in themselves to allow the women to grow into what the possibilities are.  this is critical to develop one leader in a family  most often the husband but not always.  here s the biggest problem -- strong men will only learn from other strong men  and likewise learning to be a strong woman requires the examples of strong women.  the power in these men and women is a  strength  to be patient  and often just simply to be quiet  to permit the people around them to grow.  strong people are steadfast without being bullies.  they are thrilled at the successes and growth of those around them.the crap-on everyone strategy doesnt promote good leadership.  the majority of teachers do not exemplify this  and I would say the same is true for celebrities.  how do you keep a crab in a bucket  just add a couple of other crabs  and they will keep pulling each other down -- effectively ensuring each are in misery forever.  this is what society leaders are doing.  they are preventing women becoming what they can be  and preventing men becoming what they could.
who hear  I was born under a wanderin star  and watches movies like  the last cowboy  or  rio bravo  knows how westerns could be tear jerk  melancholic and awesome at the same time.
fortunately  gina carano s take on the western  terror on the prairie  looks like its gonna be pretty kick-ass.
I ll just file this under another film that I wont be giving my time to. on a positive note I recently bought a 2 seat kayak so my daughter and I can enjoy some time out on the lakes and rivers where we live. in a way these fruitcakes that demonize us men have been a positive. when you dont watch tv or movies or sports  you have tons of time to explore new hobbies and spend more quality time with your family.  keep it real melonie. we appreciate you.
melonie you ve earned my respect and I love your content. I especially love your reaction to this and 100 percent agree with you. thank you for speaking up for us. as of right now I feel men dont have a voice though Imyself am not one to stay quiet. I am one who speaks his mind and dont care what people think. if you like me great if not then you wont be in my life is how I view things.
I love challenging games and I actually had a really good time playing tomb raider legends. this was because Imade the game more difficult for myself by restarting the checkpoint any time I lost any damage at all! the final boss was really hard with that challenge  actually Imay have even cheated on my own ruleset for that fight . do you  melonie  or anyone else ever make games more interesting by adding your own rules to them
hard times create strong men.strong men create good times.good time create weak men.weak men  create hard times. we are in the process of creating weak people  men and women both.  we are in for some hard times.
we need more men like dalton from roadhouse. nice  honest  and not afraid to throw his weight around when things go pear-shaped and treats everyone around him with respect until they show themselves to not be worthy of his respect.
thank you for making feel like Im not the only weirdo who wears tank tops throughout winter with the heater turned up! haha xd
just saw tombstone today. great western! also  whenever someone brings up  toxic masculinity  I automatically dont take their opinion seriously.
I so I just watched the video of the texas college  protest   more like an absolute leftist meltdown  and Im so glad that I saw you d uploaded. I definitely need some sanity  calm  and rationale after being subjected to that cancer. from a fellow boomer  thank you so much for what you do to keep the rest of us sane.
oh I love trinity. my dad and I qoute those movies all the time
I watched this for the 3rd or 4th time just a few weeks ago. still a great film. its kind of an anti-western. I get the feeling that only john ford could have made it  at least back then.
@octomancer  its kind of about the passing of the west  but if we want to frame it in terms of masculinity  its about two contrasting styles of masculinity  or perhaps civilization  and perhaps also how one is built upon the other.
and john wick
@girijyan murugathas  are you talking about keanu reeves
the good ones!
@lonewolf031  both
@melonie mac go boom  makes me wanna watch some of the classics.
I haaaated it and couldn t stomach any more lol
@melonie mac go boom  have you watched yellowstone  if you did  do you like that one more or less I wasn t crazy about elsa in 1883 but I got used to her. if the series continues  Im not sure if I could take more of her personality attitude but in the first season she served her purpose.
paint your wagon is a funny  but beautiful film at times too. one of my favorites.  wanderin star  and  talk to the trees  are some of my favorite things in any film ever. my sister is named after  mariah  too.
good quote. Imentioned this quote to my coworkers recently. my eastern european immigrant no-nonsense female coworker agreed  while my other coworker  a social justice soy enhanced male  they them -type wanted to argue the point
sam elliot aswell kevin costner are 2phenomenal actors who make western shows movies great to see
the old westerns are terrific.  even a b-movie can be entertaining if done well.if youre a prime subscriber  you may want to check gina s movie  terror on the prairie.   I enjoyed that one.  new westerns by and large dont grab me  and I ll define  new  as meaning anything made after tombstone and wyatt earp.  I liked the tv movie  the sackets  with tom selleck.  I also like sam elliott in any western  he s in the sackets . seraphim falls with liam neeson and pierce brosnan was good. of course unforgiven is a classic  and then we have the old spaghettI western phenomenon.  but going old school  here are westers that I love  none of which are new and so have nothing to do with being woken.red river  john wayne man of the west  gary cooper the man who shot liberty valance  john wayne  james stewart the searchers  john wayne shane  alan ladd ride lonesome  randolph scott the wild bunch  william holden winchester  73  james stewart and just because he was a manly man in real life  you can never go wrong with a western starring real life medal of honor winner  the most decorated soldier in u.s. army history  audie murphy.  perhaps watch  destry  or else  night passage. go on  give  em a try.  screw woken movies.
aww c mon melonie  Im sure your animals would share with you if they could make jerky I thoroughly enjoyed hearing about sam elliot s take in this movie. I just wish all these woke positive ppl got their own island to live n show their movies without the irrational fear of  backlash
this was in  my list  before this blew up. I haven t removed it yet  only because I haven t logged onto netflix in a few days. on the tomb raider comment and your mention of puzzles. I still have nightmares from one of the early games of having to hit a switch sprints to a second switch then sprint and baseball slide under a falling door. I did thatsooooo many times that I only remember the puzzle.
kevin costner knows how to do westerns. most recently with yellowstone and one of my favorites open range.
I really enjoyed 1883 and yellowstone. honestly think its my favorite western shows. yes the main character in 1883 is a girl portrayed kinda like a man  but I dont think its to woke. very good if your into westerns imo. also loving these vids melonie. keep it up!
dont know if you ll see this  new to the channel so Im catching up on your content  but I highly recommend open range if you haven t seen it. there was one scene  at the beginning of the final gunfight  that was brutal yet perfect in a way. no spoilers but itstuck out for how realistic it was to an actual gunfight in the old west.
once upon a time in the west  the dollarI trilogy  unforgiven  last train from gunhill  tombstone  the outlaw josey wales  highplanes drifter  young guns  all great movies. still hold up after all those years.
cowboy western movies I grew watching gave me some of my standards I stand by!! the magnificent seven  john wayne  clint eastwood  charles bronson and many many others. but no not allowed a strong man anymore. this has already backfired! decent women love a man that doesnt take shxt.great channel and stay strong decent people. cheer s
I would say   let s bring back authentic masculinity.
I gave you a sub. two videos in and you have entertained me. congratulations. a sub from doug  is like winning the lottery.
just wanted to thank you for answering my question regarding carnivore on a budget. I really appreciate you taking the time to respond.go boom.
hello mel.  another western coming out soon is  terror on the prairie  with gina carano.  it looks good to me.  check it out.  the scholar has spoken.
I have misread the title of your video for a moment  reading westerners and I was about to smash the like button at the speed of light because today basically everything is considered toxic masculinity  including being a gentleman
keep on going boom!
Im being a toxic male just watching you and I love it!
the fact your cats name is cole train is awesome   that was my favorite gears of war go-to character .cole train baby wooooooooooo !!!
I had to suffer through this movie last night going into it blind.
btw  one of the best westerns imo actually has a female lead   managed to be awesome  the quick   the dead
lol. I totally called this. I told her on twitter to make this her next episode of her new show and she already has the perfect title for it. lol. your welcome  my friend. lol.
she just saw one of those two horrible midpoint episodes 7-8  I loved the show s first episodes then those two came up and I barely got through them  they were awful imo  but then it bounced back very nicely  they just dealt with her romantic life horribly  seriously who acts like that especially back then  relationship with sam became integral to the end of the story so ennis even being involved with her just made sam unrealistic so soon and the sam thing happened so insanely quick  they should have met sam sooner in the story and realistically built their relationship over a longer time and eliminate poor ennis from existence.
I agree. those are the weakest episodes of the series. I think it was somewhat woke but still enjoyable. taylor sheridan had no intention of writing a prequel originally and was forced by the network. I feel itshows at times.
I agree with that too haha
good party  no whiskey  we go home. and this movie sounds about as western as broke back mountain  or as I like to call it  broke back door.
the core of masculinity is to build and protect. these endeavors are how masculine traits are expressed in a healthy way. a man could express masculine traits by building a community  a house  a family  a garden or any other constructive endeavor. a man could also express masculine traits by protecting his family  friends  coworkers  neighbors  etc. this is not limited to physical protection. a man expressing healthy masculinity also protects others emotional and psychological well-being. its toxic when masculine traits are used to destroy and or harm e.g. bullies.
if wild west culture was indeed a tribute to toxic masculinity  why was red dead redemption 2 so successful and had such a diverse fan base
lol wow  I love your videos! youre amazing! you made my night!
I love it when stories explode. hell yeah!
I really fail to see why they think after doing this a billion times over  obviously hyperbole   that this is a exact thing that will actually fix all of it.also is there a way where I can find a bunch of recipes that I can use for a carnivore diet because Im trying to get into that myself
open range with costner   duvall.  thats a great western.
I love your explosive laugh xdddd it makes me laugh
hard times create strong men  strong men create easy times  easy times create weak men  weak men create hard times. melonie is so based her pic is next to the prophets in heaven.
looks like I ll be doing spaghettI westerns instead of this. I ll end up with unforgiven.
power of the dogs  is figurative in that verse to allude to the psalmist enemies.
another great video! I hope you have a wonderful weekend with your mom!
hard timrs create strong men. strong men create good times. good times create weak men. weak men create hard times
I have heard thatsome of these actors dont truly believe what they say. especially when it is insane to us. they are trying not to get ostracized from hollywood and future work. its just what Ive heard  so of course I could be wrong.
12 58 there was one such man... a legend... but it was not meant for him to live... his name was... billy
favorite Bible verse.named my son after it.
classic 007 movies aged really well
I have the urge to watch my john wayne movies right now.
chippendale cowboys sounds about right when talking about modern movies. Im conflicted about 1883 though  there are some things I thought were good and other things I thought were really bad. I wouldn t describe it as  woke trash  though  other than how unbelievably modern that daughter was . is that enough for the expression to be accurate  or did Imiss other things
when I think western one scene spring to my mind the outlaw josey wales eastwood spitting the dog on the forehead funny the title made me think of thatscene
my favorite western has to be the outlaw josey wales. fond memories  watching it by my dads side as a kid. eastwood  yeah anything but a wussy! close second high plains drifter.
toxicity can manifest itself into someone s behaviour in the conventional  aggressive way or passively. how  masculine  or  feminine  someone is really just determines how their narcissism exhibits itself  but its not the source of toxic personalities. you can be a big dude with an attitude   truly confident and secure about yourself  but a narcissistic so can still obliterate your spirit until youre little more than a walking  talking shell  and youre no longer  strong  or confident around them  you walk on eggshells  lose your intensity and instead become child-like and vulnerable  which is an enviable feeling. what these wokies want to promote ironically exposes their own insecurities in all their glory. its not a computer or a platform that they need to have a conversation about toxicity  but a mirror.
sam elliot is the goat
I bet sam elliot will like daily wire s terror on the prairie  and that has a female lead. maybe it will revive the western.
I have a masculine gay friend.  you cant even tell he is gay.  does talk in that voice  doesnt walk like something is stuck up his butt  etc.  he is just a guy who is attracted to other guys.
grew up on clint eastwood and john wayne films. the best is clint eastwood s- 1992 unforgiven film. he didn t say much in the film  but he had that powerful masculine presence about him.
4 30 the way you say  toxic  masculinity  almost makes it palatable to talk about
tombstone one of my favorite westerns if its on tv I have to watch it. also any clint eastwood western.
21 22venture capital.  that is how kotaku can afford it.  basically  some rich people are investing in kotaku  and they pay through that money.  the back end of it is the expectation of the investors to get a return on investment  through ad revenue.problem is  kotaku doesnt have the requisite  clicks  to justify the return on investment.
that dirty black bag   has encouraging energy...
people complained about blazing saddles and a trigger warning was put on it on one of the streaming services that had it. crazy.
@meloniemac  dude any  cis male  archetype is not appreciated by  like critical drinker calls it   the message . you dont find it odd that most every gay dude you find on screen or in even reality shows in hollywood in fashion follow the effeminite archetype  youreally believe all of them irl are like that  course not! but if they dont flame it up  they dont get the opportunities
the quick and the dead  another good western with female protagonist sharon stone  without weakening the males
the power of the dog is a rudyard kipling poem.
hard times create strong men. strong men create good times. good times create weak men. and  weak men create hard times.g. michael hopf
great video  melonie...
in case no one has yet addressed it  I would like to point out that your sleeve is awesome.
if youre a vampire you can just be honest with me and I wont freak out.because girl  I know you do not age!!!
I paused the video to read the article and here is my gist of the movie and the novel it is based upon   a harsh man takes a dislike to his sister-in-laws son from previous marriage due to the boy seeming effeminate. it is possible thatsome of this is driven by some level of repressed attraction by phil towards effeminate boys. the boy  peter  then reacts to phils criticism by the ways of female aggression  creating a false feeling of closeness and friendship  to deliver all the more crushing and cruel revenge becouse off it.
pets are farting in the room  and sometimes the fowl stench starts to loom  I fear I ll have dig the vacuum  cause the pets are farting in the room  I dont know.
100  that needs to be like the old western movies not turn it into modern day stuff. what s your favorite western  mines between the good the bad and ugly or el dorado   mcclintock
we had 15 years of sam winchester in supernatural being a super bad ass toxic male hooking up with the most beautiful women on tv for a generation  to being talked down by all the women in his life in walker. what a joke.Imiss movies like cowboys vs aliens now.
hard times create strong men  strong men create good times  good times create weak men  weak men create hard times!
hollywood got its start with westerns  and pitate movies .  dont let it end with them.I ll just stick with the classics  the best one being butch cassidy and the sundance kid .the last great one was django unchained   though technically a spaghettI southern .
whew!!!! Im glad me   my family dont have netflix
another really good western with the duke is the cowboys. showing how kids became men in the day.
watched up to the point he climbed into bed with his brother. best western of all time  the outlaw josey wales.
commenting to feed the algorithm .  and  word on the street is there is a new western that has a strong lead.  terror on the prairie with gina carano  but Im guessing you might know about it already.
day 3 of me commenting until g-fuel sponsors me too.the old clint eastwood westerns are some of my favorite films of all time. that first twitter comment youread really defines westerns well.
I am starting to see results from this past month from working out and I plan to continue
youre such a cool chick. there you are talking about your Christianity which I think is awesome. openly in a time when it takes bravery to do so especially in your industry. and then just eaten a big old piece of beef jerky. can I clone you  lol. obviously just kidding. youre doing a great job please keep it up. God bless you and your family. duane.
I can speak only for the men but all these male feminists  or males that are against this toxic masculinity are the ones who was raised in a single family home  yes they re exceptions of the rule  without a dad or at the very least a strong male influence.  this is however the minority of men. they may be  louder but we  the strong dont need to the loudest because actions speak louder then words.
hey mel I just want to say that we all need more men and women in every movies that are strong and powerful to be in each movies and we all need to get along and stop judging each other in men and women types  ok mel. anyway I just want to say bout this topic and I just want to say that I would see the movie to see how it is but if it is not good enough to see it again than I would tell the other people to not see it and tell them that it was bad and awful movie to see  ok mel. anyway I hope you have a wonderful and great evening at home with your pets and have a good night  ok mel. also have a wonderful and great weekend this weekend with your mother too  ok mel.
bone tomahawk will be the last good western Im guessing.
clint eastwood  john wayne  sam elliot and robert duvall in westerns is what men should be.
wow a pretty girl who thinks for herself.
very easy mode for the win!!!
did she just call her audience boomers  ahahahaha
actually it doesnt take much to be  h phobic  .every sign of disagreement or questioning on that topic makes you  h  by default. you either with or against - there s no other way.
there are only wusterns now  I just made thatshit up on the fly!!
bone tomahawk was the last great western in my opinion.
they better leave sam elliott alone. he s a great actor especially westerns.
yes! someone else who thinks  the first tomb raider was the best!itseems that most people into old school gaming prefer tr2.
when I was watching this she got to the comments about the movie not being woke as I  passed a restaurant called  super wok  and thought itsaid super woke.
my understanding is blazing saddlers killed weeky tv westerns. could just be an urban legend
amen sister. I wont bother with this either.
kodI smit-mcphee played in a real western a few years ago. if youre looking for something a little more genuine  look up  slow west.
the last good western movies thats ever been made was tombstone and probably the true grit remake.
you know damn well alec baldwin movie rust would have been wokie
Im glad Im not the only one that thinks 1883 is woke trash  my wife watched the whole series and every night I would sit beside her and play a video game. about 15 minutes into her show  I would get such a headache listening to the crappy dialogue that I would turn my game off  go into the back bedroom  take a handful of aspirin and down a six pack of beer to get rid of headache.
so you like westerns  then you may like this  martial wild west
men need to be proud men again and be masculine. this doesnt mean everyone needs to be bond or rambo but be confident and bold and not cry in front of everyone  cry when youre dead sissy.women need to be ladies and feminine again. this doesnt mean covered head to toe and silent  but to be more measured and conservative. its the men who are expected to be loud and dumb and do the reckless things. it takes a good woman to reel him back from doing the really dumb dares and stupid actions. we use to be proud of our differences and what made ourselves unique from the other sex. we use to cherish a woman being beautiful and curvy and feminine. we use to exalt men for being very muscular and confident. we ve lost values that truly matter like family  good neighbors  and strong communities or so media would like you to forget it.we need to have faith again. not that you have to believe in my religion and my God but faith in one s self  faith in others to do what s right  and faith that your life is important and you mean something. its become too ugly and rotten out there but its not the end of days  yet.
westerns are meant to be gritty  fun  and full of adventure. this is just further proof that no movie genre is beyond the touch of woke politics. its like an eye sore in modern movie. youre sitting there watching the film and the story is progressing and then there it is  like slamming on the brakes to have a seminar about dumb shit thats got nothing to do with anything.
westerns ended with unforgiven.
btw when youread that verse in context with the rest of the chapter   its about praising God even in the face of danger   if the danger is within you or within the world that exists around you . the implication here is that masculinity is dangerous .
first time I have seen your vids and I agree.. I cantell you are from texas like I am. lol
I wouldn t consider  the power of the dog  to be a western. the moment you said it took place in 1925  I knew it was complete and total crap. the west had been settled by then. you ve also got modern forms of transportation. unless they re on a ranch  no one is running around on horseback when they ve got cars and trains they can use. you didn t have the kind of struggle that you had in the latter part of the 19th century. also  every part of the west had become a state by then. so  the lawlessness that existed in the western territories was long gone.to me  a good western has a simple plot. its good guys vs. bad guys. its a formula that always works. some good westerns that Ive seen include true gritpale riderunforgiventhe good  the bad  and the uglya fist full of dollarsfor a few dollars morethe outlaw josey walesI also enjoyed the remakes of  true grit  and the  magnificent seven.  at first  I was kind of opposed to them. I think its ridiculous to remake great classics  but both films were very good.
to seriously paraphrase jordan peterson  masculinity is not toxic. strong  decisive  honest  has integrity  powerful are all benefits to a society and are not toxic. when men dont act masculine  thats when they become toxic  deceitful  indecisive  cowardly.
its on netflix. of course its woke
I heard that podcast. there was no wild tirade. there was no homophobia or sexism. he just said the movie was a piece of sh!t  an opinion he s entitled to and which many agree with.
high plains drifter is one of the greatest movies ever made. fight me. lol
I need a cap  make human great again
@sho the ninja of the ganja clan  I get sarcasm doesnt read well through text but you need to take a chill pill.
have you seen and God said to cain starring klaus kinski
@indian 2080s  yes. the great silence is kinskI s best western though.
its an adaptation of a book by thomas savage  it is not an critique perse on toxic masculinity as far as I understand. more about the fight against changes in ones life and how a narcissistic arrogant self image is poisonous to those around you.
cumberbatches character was also about a man not wanting to change his way of life  and he did struggle with it. having seen the movie that was my take at least. dunst was only background noise for me.
soooo its basically  brokeback mountain part 2   more broke  more woke.
benedict cumberbatch  used to be one of my favorite actors.  now his roles and quite frankly him ehhhh.  its amazing people leave money on the table.  I guess when you have so much it doesnt matter.
I did see this movie it was not so bad but I defiantly prefer tombstone  the good the bad and the ugly etc.
good timing!  just rewatched tombstone   hickock yesterday  and followed them up with power of the dog  - noped out 40  long  minutes in.  itseems masculinity   femininity are both under attack in the west - for reasons    think its time to replay rdr1  erase that memory  lol.
on 1883 it was both one of the better and worst western shows ever made  first 5 or 6 episodes were great then it went off the rails for a couple episodes worse than any show I ever saw  that is what you saw   we are talking worse than the game of thrones crash in the final season but then to its credit the last couple episodes really came back very well  weirdest thing I ever saw with a show  they just handled her love life like a complete psycho disaster. taylor sheridan is brilliant bringing back westerns but he does not have a clue about properly integrating romantic themes. fyI check out his show with kevin costner yellowstone and the movie wind river with jeremy renner and the olsen girl from mcu  both brilliant neo-westerns.
I live in the gay capital of the uk and have spent the last 50 years around the gay community... the vast majority of gay men you wouldnt even know.  most of them are very fit  hunky  guys who spend all their free time in gym.the camp gay man is a stereotype invented from 50 years of television celebrities who intentionally amp up their campness.
I prefer westerns like silverado and unforgiven. I wont be bothered with a broke back rehash.
there was great acting  great cinematography but by the end I was just like ughhhhh what a waste of time
Im confused  are you saying power of the dog is too woke   and which part is the wussifying exactly   curious to hear your thoughts after you watch it.
these people take that verse from psalms way out of context in order to profit and spread lie. psalm 22 is a song written by david about how the  woke  people of the world  in denying God  calling for one other to not lend aid to him on account of him remaining devoted to  jehovah. these people are the dog that the verse is referring to. and  yet even in this time of desperation and not seeing God s hand in support  he calls out that people in the generations to come will praise the name of  jehovah...
the power of the dog  what happens if the dog has rabies  I have read cujo
a woke woman director shoots a movie in new zealand claiming it looks like montana and has guys in only chaps running around half naked.
aww  kitty!  hI coltrane!   my masculinity aside .
go watch some john wayne movies. he did so many and most of em were great. pilgrim. start with red river.
just because you dont have a mustache doesnt mean that you cant get up off your knees and be a man.
for a few dollars more  the good  the bad  and the ugly  the outlaw josey wales  tombstone  young guns 1   2.. best westerns ever.
1883 is an awesome show
my favorite western is logan. might be the only western I like
1883 is awful
wind river is a great movie very impactful
the good the bad and the ugly is my all time fav!
@melonie mac go boom  a movie they could never remake. it would be butchered so bad.
I know what you mean  I have a very bossy 167lbs cane corso roman italian mastiff who requires deer meat to not pout at me.
Im one of the few people who still pay attention to the oscars. power of the dog is one of the worst best picture nominees Ive ever seen but its probably going to win this year. just shows how pointless the oscars are
sam elliot - gay  wtf !! he s been married to katherine ross  from butch cassidy and the sundance kid  for decades!!! this guy is one of my generation s icons! my ex-husband used to get mad at me for hating on roadhouse  d uh! sam elliot dies!! .
Im here melonie  I liked  I subscribed and smashed that bell!
the pink in that room ... is making my room pink. monitor brightness at half.
dear God we will trade you every woke western star for john wayne
boy howdy!  thats a sonic boom.
takes out her john wayne dvd s
in process of moving west to arizona myself. tombstone  az.
yellowstone is a good series
......
lol frankie go boom!
speaking of dog. check out the good movie  dog.
I didn t feel this movie was a western it was set in the 20s of montana also no gunslinging
good times create weak men and bad times and creat strong men
my favorite western movie is young guns thats the top favorite movie !
hm. I read through psalm 22  and I dont think it means what jane campion thinks it means  especially verses 12 - 21 .oh  and I have a picture of coltrane I ll post via link to you on twitter.  d
so its not a westen its a themed soap opera... well its worse its telenovela with a budget
who is the audience market for this stuff
let us be men.
did you se the size of that chicken
@tara reece  yeah thats a hilarious scene  hahaha !
notice how nobody ever talks about toxic feminity
rainbow cowboy  rainbow viking and rainbow maffia movies incoming. give me the movie brimstone instead anyday. on a side note  john travolta is a gay man with real toxic masculanity.
just the title of the film alone doesnt sound like a successful film.
for the algorithm!
I agree with you but film is amazing
with all these  must have at least one woman on the board or pay lolsumsofmoney in fines  laws thatspread like rabbits on cocaine ... paying one of the dudes to sexchange seems reasonable  wonder how they determined who needs to  volunteer .  p
you want to play a game that doesnt hold your hand... play morrowind...
almost all movies are woke now especially disney . disney is the original woke community .
I think of intoxication like potency. Im ever trying to increase the toxicity of my masculinity. toxic masculinity is intoxicating to toxically-feminine females.
they already made military commercials woke  now westerns get the same treatment  this is depressing. Im still an optimistic individual  but now slightly less-so.
yellowstone is a pretty great
I hate it when these soulless corporations who couldn t care less about what God wants culturally appropriate scripture for their own ends. they should stay in their lane.
I thought the movie looked interesting from the trailer but after this video I now know not to watch it. shame as I like the cast. watch the adam project. its actually good.
hey kitty meow
go boom
the power of the gay
booom
we need a new punk scene.  where are all the punks   where are any of the subcultures today   there is no more underground scenes  no interesting music culture  nothing cool anymore for young people.
dont say gay!!
I watched that movie  and the moment cumberbatch s character was made to look like a bad guy for making fun of the skinny waiter kid  I knew it was a horseshit movie.its absolutely unbelievable. he made an amusing remark about the guy  and now Im supposed to feel like he s a bad guy for it  later on he burnt one of the guy s flowers that he made from paper. and while thats not a nice thing to do  who gives a shit  make another one. why should he have to care about your paper flower
agree to disagree  the film wasn t even really a western
@evar jantz  ok
@evar jantz  did you like brokeback mountain  if bit why  do youreality thing there were not homosexual or psychos in cowboys. it is a western and it is a good movie. I am sorry but statistically it was true. and if you dont think the movie is good you dont understand nuance and dont know much about much about art .
then again. wouldn t itsuffice to say  I identify as something female  these days
that dirty black bag  is promising
just another movie to put on my  never will watch  list. I ll just wear my toxic masculinity hat proudly.
honey...I am ooold..boomer old...enjoying u as  real person...you go...as for men so for women...womb-an wokeism...male-ish woke-ism...here we are
so  let me get this straight. you wouldn t be into a tombstone remake with a black lesbian with the side of her head shaved as wyatt earp
difference between brokeback mountain and present day movies about gays is that brokeback wasn t done in a forced political way.
weak men harm women true masculine men dont harm women.
cumberbatch is not a man. he s an adult male pretender  but no man.
the power of the dog  sounds like a capeshitstory where a dog has superpowers
well... here s another film I wont see. do wanna see the batman though even if it has that crazy kravitz chick in it.
1883 was woke trash. she was a big strong wahmen did not need no man  the best warrior  out did all the men  it was sickening.
masculine men and women who want to be mothers. society needs both.
play red dead redemption 22222222 I wanna see what you d build your online character like
sam elliot loved brokeback mountain  sam elliott critics forgot how he enjoyed quintessential gay cowboy movie  brokeback mountain   calling it  a beautiful film
I have watched this film  sad  sad times  it was really bad and very slow. the story could have been told in 30-45 minutes not the 120minutes it took. worst film I watched last year. having said that I did not find it particularly woke  but then again 15minutes into it I started to scroll on my phone. I will never trust my wife again when she says  honey do you want to watch a western
the wokie men today are just jealous of orange man  they got what we warned them of. they got him  sad thing is  we all have to suffer too. lgb!
watching 1883 and have not seen one thing  woke . I dont think ppl even understand what that word means. matter of fact they dont
psalm 22 was written by david  when he was running for life. it is about anguish and the pain and suffering david was going through at that time in his life  it gives an impression of Jesus suffering on the cross  since Jesus uses some of the same words  but the article saying it is about Jesus dying on the cross is a little reductive and a stretch I think   I think they saw the first line and didn t look any further  I dont know it was written by david almost a 1000 years before Jesus so for the article to just say it is about Jesus on the cross seems to be missing the point
come to kentucky melonie  I ll teach you to hunt  whack  drag  gut  butcher a deer  and from there you can make ground venison or venison jerky.
if gay men and women hate real men. why is there always a husband and wife in their defining their relationships  marriages
sam elliott is still a democrat so he got what he paid for
why would trump say he lost. it would be a lie
it actually does describe Jesus  death so perfectly that I feel like it has to be some kind of prophecy. read the psalm again  and this time pay attention to some of the smaller details. look up what crucifixion does to the human body  especially the heart and the joints. notice that it talks specifically about the soldiers gambling for his clothes. there s even more in there  but thats all I can remember specifically off the top of my head.
so effeminate men are exactly like toxic women  that makes perfect sense.
@16 15. based!
toxic masculinity. does that mean real men  just curious.
this movie is so slow and strange I stoped watching before I even got halfway
Imiss old wildwest movies when people just shoot killing everybody  nowadays its everything woke  political. they demand representative characters  maan im so tired of this bs
boomers lol...love this channel but calling us boomers is cringey
I dont read these types of reviews that aren t. they re justifications for putting out crap movies. people who fall for this type of drivel have lost enough iq points that they could be classified as a jelly fish.
Jesus is Lord God bless
the movie was ok. but honestly  it didn t really feel like a  western  to me. much better movies this year. and... you thought sam elliot was gay  goodness.
you rang
isn t this movie about a gay dude just displaying toxic gayness while hiding he is gay  bullying is a typical lefty gay thing as far as I know.
hard times create strong men. strong men create good times. good times create soft men. soft men create hard times ... rinse and repeat...
trump s fault
what are westerns  they are about men being men.  how do you destroy the genre   from brokeback mountain to the power of the dog you make cowboys gay.
yet another movie denigrating men in order to make insufferable women feel better about themselves or get off on a degenerate fanfiction.at least it isn t a re-make of an old movie  I guess...  thats something  right
bring trump back! we need a legend back in the white house!
I thought it was one of the worst movies Ive ever seen. I turned it off and googled how it ended. just a very boring movie.
eat more meat and say no to soy and you get more masculine men!
let me add an addendum  toxic masculinity  what they want girly man  bro thats why I stick to anime.
lol one of my cousins said he was gay so I just believed it
