the one thing thatsurprised me more than anything about tomb raider when coming back to the games as an adult to finally play through and beat them all was how active the modding community is for those games. seriously.  there s thousands of custom levels available for download.
so awesome to see someone rabid about tomb raider  the future for lara seems very vague right now and love any update or news or even anything croft related. found your channel about a couple weeks ago  binge-watched your episodes  subscribed and really look forward to whatever you got coming next. I was only 16 when the first tomb raider came out  keep it coming  I cant get enough of tomb raider  past  present or future. keep booming!
this looks cool   I love that there are so many great tomb raider fan campaign mods.  can you make a video of your favorites   did you ever play the daggrr of xion remake demo   that was incredible and a great modern day take on the oldschool gameplay  wish they would finish it.
I d definitely play that game! Ive played so many fan mods translations that  give an entirely new experience playing games we love.
fans   bring back the classic costume and persona!  reality is often disappointing..    thanos
whoa. this is quite nostalgic for me. I love how everything looks like a replica of the first tomb raider I played as a kid. really simple  not overly done. this is great stuff
thank you for putting these videos out  and for inspiring others to do better with their lives. Ive had a very rocky relationship with the Lord these past few years and you ve got me to pick up the Bible once again. Im on the path towards healing  so thanks.
I was hoping you would cover the tr poll results. I hope cd is paying attention to what the fans want. this mod looks amazing!have you seen the fan remake preview of tr  aod from julian guba  freakraider   I know tr doesnt always need fancy graphics  but I would love to see aod done right with better controls. I think it had such a cool story.
this tomb raider game gives me a bit of a vibe like the streets of rage remake or the atarI 2600 homebrew scene  totally done out of love by fans. I still have my ps1 kicking around somewhere  and I would definitely give this a shot if I can get my hands on it. plus  any excuse to get nostalgia berries from that ps1 boot-up music.
sharing a little of the incredible work tr fans are doing with the classic engine. I know Im preaching to the choir with you mel thailand inspired  city of the Gods level preview - https   youtu.be jxexxdjsytq t 160tru pole climbing -  https   youtu.be 9_lcttkzmquthere s so much out there and the love being put into it all is really something else.
remember how in tr1 she had the ark of the covenant in her mansion the holy iconography fits and some of the areas look like they would fit a level in jerusalem beneath the temple mount.how cool would that be!  a tr1 prequel story of how she got the ark
this would be something we could grab the iso and play on a ps classic or a chipped ps1  or epsxe . and Im all for it. definitely subbing to him to keep up to date.
family issues aside  lara croft from tomb raider legend is my favorite.I really miss thatstrong bad ass personality!!
amen to what you said  melonie   about how we should be trying to be good. I had a sinful habit for most of my life that I thought I d never be able to break  but through many years God took me through the process of finding out how to fight it  and now Im winning my fight against it way more often than I stumble.
there are a good 8 or so vids of yours Ive been meaning to go back to and comment on  in a good way in all cases  for sure  but anyhow I just wanted to tell you your stuff s been great and Im overjoyed that you dont let these professional victims and basement-dwelling whiners get to you or discourage you  no joke  it inspires hope for the future of this civilization.  the only way that the societal stupidity with which we re faced goes away is if everyone finally says  nope  not budging  Ive a right to my beliefs and youre being an idiot  mr ms mx wokie! . I kinda got away from the topic of this video I know  lol  and I did love seeing such a cool project.  but I felt it was long overdue and had to tell you  be of good courage  and never let any of them shame you for not being morally and intellectually crashed.
since I started watching your videos Ive started to get curious about the original tomb raider games  Ive only played the remake trilogy up until now . Imanaged to hunt down the legend trilogy  playing through it now   but Im not sure which version of the first series of games to hunt down. is there a good hd remake fan-mod  like the one that they are making for silent hill 2   that I could hunt down  or a collection of the games for the pc consoles  Im legitimately curious what the  best way to experience them would be.
Im not sure where I exactly heard this from  but your verse and discussion of striving to be a good person reminded me of it  which goes something akin to  sainthood is not the avoidance of sin  but rather the struggle against it .  indeed  we are called in all ways to be holy not only for our own salvation but also so that   people may see the good that we do and give thanks to God   as it is written.  and  Lord in heaven  itsure does appear that way  with the impact you are having here with your channel.  I pray indeed may the Lord richly bless you in continuation of your good work  melonie  both with courage and in strength.
the game looks great! I love seeing you nerd out and fan girl over things  especially over classic tomb raider because you grin from ear to ear.
daft question  I was hoping to replay all the core tomb raider games sometime and wondered what you thought of this play order  I was thinking the survivor trilogy first  lara s younger days  followed by og tr 1   2  chronicles  aod  2006 reboot trilogy then tr3 and revelations  my head canon being that lara would be recounting what happened to her in egypt . or does it not really matter  thanks.also  very grateful for the  verses of the day   they are like short daily devotionals!
ever heard of the tomb raider 1 game boy advance fan port  some mad scientists got it to run on that hardware  and it looks pretty good. this new ps1 project looks fantastic. I hope the guy gets to finish it and doesnt get hit with a c d.
yeah but you didn t play any of those  you just downloaded the nood modz.
@themighty pen15  yea  I did play them. why would I waste my time with nudity mods
yes!!! I have tomb raider legend on ps2 and I also have tomb raider anniversary on ps2
amen you you  brother or sister. there are so many faiths out there  I embrace Christianity   my savior Jesus  but they all ask for us to do good work  for our creator s glory . good works isnt something mankind made  but a divine order- it has a purpose   with focus ...and I think it drives liberals crazy because you cant just change it to your liking. God bless us   give us all conviction! God love you  mel
the reboot trilogy does not align with the classic story whatsoever so it would be very jarring haha. I recommend playing them all in order personally  but it depends. the classics are more difficult and oldschool style of gameplay  my fav   legend  anniversary  and underworld have an amazing aesthetic but easied up the gameplay  and the reboot trilogy feels like uncharted with a woman who happens to have lara croft s name but doesnt act or look like her. all still good in their own way  but the classics are forever my all time fav
chronicles and aod are the unarguably the worst ones and I would recommend people skip them. only if youre a hardcore tr fan would I recommend someone play through them. chronicles is boring and samey  but aod is borderline unplayable. people have made better fan-levels than either of those games.I would recommend playing tr 1 - 4 in that order first  to give you a good baseline for what tomb raider  should  be.
@melonie mac go boom  true  the 90s games were the greatest ones. perhaps I ll leave them all until the end  best for last. adding this fan game to the list  of course.
@bud389  aye  the classics have a lot of love  thanks.
amen to all that. if more people took the time to listen to their hearts and practice their faith without fear  this world would be a much better place. but  its up to all of us to keep our faith and help others practice theirs as well  let them practice their religions and beliefs without someone saying  oh your culture is wrong or your faith in God is stupid. I say a prayer every night before I sleep and every morning before I get out of bed and start my day and I think by reconnecting with my faith  I have become more stronger and healthier for it. so  thank you  melonie. not just as my long time friend. but  as someone who is keeping the faith when so many continue to lose it. may God s love  wisdom and guidance always be with you. much love and respect to you  my friend.
I just found your channel  but I gotta say your heavier takes sold me.  keep crushing it.
I really appreciate the message in your verse of the day today.although the deck can seem stacked against us  we should never give up trying to be good. we are definitely not going to be perfect and our good works aren t going to be enough  eph 2 8-9 for it is by grace you have been saved  through faith and this is not from yourselves ...but that doesnt mean you stop trying.the haters out there would benefit from tuning in.
instead of save crystals  I think I d prefer manual saves  kinda like in the pc and mobile versions of the classic games. the only thing I d change is to limit the amount of saves per level. smaller levels would allow you to save 2 or 3 times  larger levels would let you save about 5 times. that way  you get to choose when you save  instead of running into some of the problems that were present in 4 and 5  but its still a decent challenge  and makes you think tactically.
glad to know Im not the only one still playing old ps1 games. Im playing fear effect 1 and then 2.
20-30 years and I still remember most thatstuff lol
this looks pretty cool.  I wonder how it will be released.  can psone play burned iso s if the game isn t meant to have copy protection on the black disk
7 44 if I remember right  when the ps2 generation came out  the crash bandicoot people said that what use to take them a week-month to make for the crash games were now doable in an afternoon. it wouldnt shock me if a game looking like this was a full game and not just a level  the hard part is not creating an environment that bit  its down to gameplay and traversal which is quite a bit harder to make worthwhile.
absolute perfection
the potential for a new old school tomb raider game awesome awesome! if Im being honest though  Im more pumped for the next elden ring stream... when is it !
you should do one of those long-form essay style videos of you playing classic tomb raider
day 16 of me commenting on all of your videos until g-fuel sponsors me.this looks so good!hey mel  can you make a group password for your elden fans  that way we all can see each other s notes and bloodstains  I think that d be cool since youre streaming it a lot lately
congrats on making it to the elite 8!
hey melonie. since youre enjoying elden ring so much and you mentioned you wanted to use you ps5 more  you should try returnal if you haven t yet. its getting a patch in a week with free content and co-op. its a great game.
her personality is just so awesome!
I was playing sony playstationone over the weekend  silent hill. I recently saw I got it for  12 in 2011  its now worth  240 so I said oh must play. the game is just a horrifying delight.
its really not difficult to make a decent tomb raider game on paper. its just that  they  dont want to do it. same thing happened to assassin s creed..every year that goes by in modern gaming  the more I find myself looking to old-school titles. retro is the way forward.
Im a big fan of tomb raider games since childhood. I will always love lara croft  I wish had a ps1 I only have ps2 and ps3 console.
I d be fine with save crystals coming back  as long as the easy option allowed auto save etc  that way it doesnt annihilate younger fans or non gamers. the save crystal mechanic in the 90s is what made me hate video games as a kid because I couldn t manage it back then.
I remember long long time ago I played a x-men fighting game on the ps1 Imiss those days .
first!!!
lmao I should ve waited to write my comment until I watched the whole video. just saw your potentially streaming tonight and if so  I ll be there!
if Im not mistaken  most models of ps3 are actually backwards compatible with most ps1  not ps2  games. of course  nothing compares with playing on original hardware  but that option is worth looking into for playing those games  if you weren t already aware
well my original playstation  it wasn t called  one  back then  from  1995 recently died on me  may it rest in pieces  so I guess I ll hope for a pc emulation. sure looks interresting.love your channel. go boom.
omg I want to play this it looks so great  also youre kitty is so cute!
Imay have missed itsince I am relatively new to your channel but I would like to hear your views on horizon forbidden west. really like your views.
the first tomb raider I played was 2 back on the ps1 so for me my fav lara outfit has to be with the hair tail thing. the first game she doesnt have that
reminded me of the blood born psx the ps1 downgrade that you can play for free  on pc so dope
I live the old tombraider games but Im not crazy about the ps1 era asctetics. give me a complete tombraider 1 remake with updated graphics  as with the resI evil remakes and Im all in. that would be epic!
save crystals is a terrible idea. that would be like opening a museum with a victorian theme and saying  ooh  we need the bubonic plague in here for authenticity!
hay melony.your vids inspired me to get the first and second tomb raider games for the ps1.Im gonna play them on my ps2  any tips for a newbie to the games
so as a kid idk how I acquired them but I had all 3 og tomb raiders for the ps1 and to this day I will argue that angelina jolie was perfect as lara croft but I digress I wasn t the biggest fan of tomb raider but I at least played it back in the   day and enough to know the jokes like having to sit there and turn to the side and jump just for her to jump the wrong way and die and also the butler creeped me out on I think tomb raider 3 where you can run around her mansion and he just follows you the whole time  his face just looked weird on my tv and it creeped me out and I would try to kill him but you couldnt.
is this legal   I will make it legal!
I just finished my tombraider hl2 replica of a real stainless steel hk usp match. now I need to build a second one
hey mel I just want to say that your co host cole train did a wonderful   fantastic great job of being your co host for today s streaming show on youtube  ok mel. anyway I also just want to say that I think that this new tomb raider video game for ps1 is going to be cool and neat and rad to play on ps1 and maybe hopefully on pc  ok mel. anyway I can not wait for it to come out for me to get it to see how I like it and how I will do by playing it too  ok mel. anyway I just want to tell you that and I want to say bout this topic  ok mel. anyway I hope you and your pets have a wonderful   great evening at home and have a good night too  ok mel.
wait  youre a fan of classic tomb raider  when did this happen !
I believe in you  you can get into the top 4  and win this contest!
your cat looks like my cat seren. best damn cat I have ever had
save points always annoy me in games. what if you have to put down the game in a hurry and aren t anywhere near a save point
I dont really get how people could confuse your message whether or not your soul goes to heaven. of course you aren t saying that what you do in this life doesnt matter  only that just being a good person isn t enough. which is a sad reflection on life as a whole actually  just being a good person is almost never enough.
does square enix not realize that tomb raider ports would probably make a great deal of money  sheesh.
meanwhile  more seriously  wonder if that goes with the tr1 multiplayer mod somehow...
coltraine   attention achieved  cold trains outta there
persevere with learning the controls. it ll be worth it when you get used to it
the senate has spoken.
@dying rose   I am the senate!
everytime I play tomb raider games I be so glad when I get to a checkpoint.
melonie you know this feels unreal right  Christian gamer girl reading Bible verses  such a rare find. Im so damn lucky to be honest
dont forget melonie  sony playstationone game discs can be played on all sony playstation 3 consoles and its hdmi. I have 2 set ups  one is my classic set up  and modern set up which that needs updating. my snes  nes  sony playstationone  nintendo gamecube  n64  sega mega drive  sega saturn are all connected on a 26  sony trinitron pvm-crt with 480p progressive scan resolution capabilities to accommodate my gamecube hooked through the nintendo power proprietary component cable enabling 480p progressive scan resolution. its the best monitor to play classic consoles on.I dont even have 4k yet  let alone 4k oled from lg or sony. I still have my sony bravia hdtv 1080p  I have a 32   42  and 45  all sony bravia 10800 hdtv. they still work great and the price of 4k oled I ll wait till my hdtvs die. on those hdtvs I have a sony playstation 3  4  nintendo wiI u  nintendo switch  analogue super nt  mega sg. never did xbox. if you can afford it  melonie I recommend adapting 2 gaming rooms or set ups  1 is for classic gaming  other is for modern gaming. the sony trinitron pvm-crt monitors really are worth it if you still have your classic consoles  cartridges and discs.
where did you get thatsmall scar from
they should port it to the game boy advance tomb raider engine that the mod community made.
I still have my old ps2.. which is backward compatible with ps1. I wonder if I can play it on that.
psalm 119 65-72 is one of my favorite passages.
I have to wonder if you know anything about trle   people make custom levels online in the classic style of tomb raider using 4 5 and they also have a next gen trle engine some people use too. you can download other peoples levels and play them.
shoutout to coletrain hijacking the channel. its his channel now mel  p all jokes aside  im glad the fans are taking back their favorite ip. square needs to take notes on how to curate a well established ip. make save crystals great again.
speaking of representation  marvel forgot that blade exists.
you should check out the cinemax show banshee with antony starr
grats on the gfuel comp!
came for the problematic gamer takes. stayed for the Bible verse of the day.for the next androgynous laura croft video you have to do read song of solomon 8 8 - we have a young sister  and her breasts are not yet grown. what shall we do for our sister for the day she is spoken for  God bless
I rescued seven cats from the streets of mexico. and two of them super love me and always want to be rubbing on my legs or in my lap. so thats a sign that cat sure does love love ya!booooom!
bring back the shorts leeeeeets gooooooooo!
for the jedI who s comment youread. through passion  I gain strength.through strength  I gain power.through power  I gain victory.through victory  my chains are brokenthe force shall free me.
good luck with the quarterfinals.
me  use the word strive - its got a better nuance than  try !3 seconds latermm   ... strive... me  it comes down to one s  heart  - if one believes the gospel and wants to follow Jesus then as the saying goes  your heart will break for what breaks his  and by extension you ll want to strive to be  good  like him despite our failings.not everyone who says they re a Christian are sincere which is why so many fall short of this.
that tail game though lol
see  Im not as nerding as you are melonie when it comes to sony playstationone tomb raider  however I am for silent hill. still I ll fight you and anyone of the comments  the best sony playstationone game is k namI s castlevania symphony of the night  I find new things ever playthrough. but sotn is a 2d hand animated sprites in 32 bit. as far as 3d playstationone games go  I prefer silent hill to all of them tho I do enjoy resident evil 3 nemesis. silent hill is the scariest of survival horror  and its a very unique and creepy world. late playstation game  1999.
good stuff
yes  I have streamed quite a lot of trle levels and even voiced lara in some of them when I was a teenager haha. I loooove the trle community
@melonie mac go boom  oh good! not allot of people know about it!
he exist in the multiverse. he comes from the boomerverse.
he kills vampires and anything else that preys upon humanity  fights a corrupt government  drives a bitchin  set of wheels  and doesnt pay taxes.the daywalker is a proper hero  dammit.
also luke cage. and bishop  from x-force. and  kind of a deep cut  night thrasher. and my favorite black comic hero  cloak from cloak   dagger. there have been solid black marvel heroes in comics  created back in simpler times when it wasn t forced  and wasn t for social credits. when all this race grievance culture blew up  they should ve said  we ve been representing just fine  thanks   and left it at that. but nope... they just had to alienate half their fanbase  just for fun. and money  of course
psalm 119 is all about striving to do as God wishes us to do  james 2 14-26 is the reflection of that if you have faith it will show in your actions. God bless you and give you strength to continue being a light in the cesspool of the internet. also  I could use more elden ring streams
exactly grace is not an excuse sin rather it is a better motivator to do better. the law has no ability to save only reveals what needs to be. it is grace that allows us to overcome our own sinful desires. and by daily fellowship with God we not only gain a greater measure of his grace but in turn become better representatives of what life inside the kingdom of God looks like.
happy st patrick s day! melanie mac go boomer. lol
the next tomb raider just needs to be  reboot lara meets classic lara at the at the himalayas where classic lara  originally crashed and learned her survival skills. classic lara kills her and becomes tomb raider and thats how classic lara came into existence. she steals the reboot lara s identity  life  and assets  and becomes the tomb raider purely for sport and for personal thrill and gain. I think that would truly salvage any dissent with the original fans that the reboot caused.
pop filter when  you make my subwoofer go boom!
nothing beats classic tomb raider level design. it makes me so sad that crystal dynamics started to chase the uncharted fanfare with the survivor reboot. its nothing exciting to repeat same game design the other studio has already created. darrell gallagher was so obsessed with what sony s ps studios in santa monica area achieved with their narrative driven cinematic games.you have josh from whatculture gaming who brings up that tomb raider reboot didn t have the same culture fanfare that tomb raider used to hit. for him square enix has been ups and downs for the past few years. sqex are always chronically disappointed with their games from western subsidiary. nothing hits their sales expectations and they send them out to die with little to none marketing. and they let hitman and ioI go because it didn t have any value to them anymore. just see what hitman 3 is able to do now without sqex.there is no doubt they have mismanaged their western subsidiary. they bought out eidos interactive in 2009 because eidos was in financial trouble and have been since 2003. eidos closed ion storm in 2005. core design was sold off to rebellion in 2006. sqex was not the right company to manage eidos in the right direction. you need a stronger leadership and management because eidos was a pain to save when the publisher itself was already mismanaged for many years. sqex has only invested money into games without bringing any culture into their western subsidiary. they dont care about the products.and you wonder if crystal dynamics and eidos montreal will ever expand to make classic tomb raider  bring back gex  give deus ex a better treatment  eidos opens a studio in austin to make thief good  crystal dynamics expands to let a team revive legacy of kain. they need to bring culture into their resources.I will always respect core design for what they did with tomb raider and same thing should apply to thief  looking glass studio   deus ex  ion storm   gex  and legacy of kain. respect your classics and make new ips when youre a familiar with the roots. game design can make or break your game. and for me eidos was never a publisher that had games with super cinematic direction for their games with generic art style.
you have to do a tic tok viral crazy video  I know its old  but why not do the ice water challenge in a white t-shirt... huh ... are you sure1 ... ok... sorry  youre not allowed to do that  apparently frosk has to do it to save her g4 career.
you can emulate it on pc if you know how to.
as Christians we strive for perfection Jesus Christ as our example but we will never reach it here on earth.
go boom
the graphics look awful  but tomb raider itself is like the dark souls of games
I believe in being a good person and Im fine with people having belief in there Gods. it does trigger me a bit when I hear the Christian stuff  because Ive been associated with people that are so strick in their beliefs  they say that believing in paganism  buddism  muslim  or other Christian religions  other than theirs   is evil and we need to be converted. mostly orthordox or seventh day eventists  and in australia we have them activily knocking on our doors trying to convert us  that really annoys me  and I have to politely tell them to go away.when you look at the history of the religion and all of the evil that the religious organisation  Christian and others  in the past  it is hard to accept that organisation that runs the religion actually follows the intent of the belief system  and is more about oposing those that dont follow there belief system  converting people and taking money from them. it feels to me that the people who believe in there Gods are more pure than the religious organisations.
so yesterday was my birthday  Im old    I showered my 12 yo son you r videos he liked your game knowledge  but he  did not understand when I told him about the computer stuff  commodore 64  .and how cool it was making a balloon go across the screen  please make a video of old stuff. thanksmatt
