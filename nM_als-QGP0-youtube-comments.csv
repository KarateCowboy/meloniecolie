so thankful she was able to open the door for ladies like sigourney weaver and linda hamilton.
she also invented having blonde hair and two eyes. I literally never saw women with that combination before brave and stunning jlaw.she s such an innovator. the ultimate pioneer.
you know. Im glad we finally got confirmation. I  for one  am grateful to jennifer for inventing women. they are pretty neat sometimes
when jennifer lawrence said  get away from her you bitch  to the alien queen in aliens  it gave me goosebumps.
aliens  sigourney weaver will always be my number one female action star. she not only was a boss badass  but she also held her femininity. she was reeling from the loss of her daughter from a prolonged cryo-sleep. she also showed genuine care and motherly instincts for newt.
the fact that actors can just say the wildest things in interviews and the interviewer wont even question it  is hilarious to me. I d love to see an actor abuse this power to just completely clown on an interviewer.
we have reached the peak of insanity. jennifer lawrence  hold my brain.
its really astounding thatshe  as a fellow hollywood actress  rescinds acknowledgement of sigourney weaver s existence in this self pat interview.sigourney came first as a mainstream theatrical female bad ass  take serious  relatable action star  who quite remarkably didn t even need to represent what was typical of hollywood s  glamour girl  looks  to earn the respect  admiration and love of audiences around the world.   jennifer has playfoam for brains.
also jennifer lawrence is the first woman ever to understand algebra and to drive a car.
long kiss goodnight    la femme nikita    fifth element    red sonja   lara croft movies.  list goes on and on.  one of my favs that never gets mentioned is gina davis in  long kiss goodnight .  love that movie  even had samuel jackson in it  and nobody remebers it.
wow she is such a great woman!  I owe her my life!  how self absorbed can someone be   apparently she is.
jennifer lawrence not only inspired women like linda hamilton to be action stars  she also inspired actreses outside of america to become action heroines like michelle yeoh! you go  girl!
actors out of touch with reality  more like at war with reality.
I think that I need to send her a thank you card. she is a true hero who needs to be recognized. sadly  I wont be able to send jennifer lawrence a thank you card until she invents thank you cards.
I just want to point out that thanks to jennifer  sigourney weaver was actually nominated for a best actress oscar for her work in  aliens.  I think thats still the only sci-fI film acting nomination ever.
best thing about ripley in aliens is thatshe wasn t trying to out  big strong man  the space marines in that movie. she was kicking ass because she d connected with newt on a purely maternal level and was in full  mama bear  mode trying to protect her cub from the big nasty aliens.  and sarah connor too. she was trying to save her son and the future of the whole world and not trying to be a man or out man any man. and that goes for all of the og female action heroes. they were fully fleshed out human beings that people could relate to first and only became heroic because the situation warranted it. its only this new generation of absolute mary sue s that have lost all of their femininity  humanity  and have become emotionless  self hating man hating  characters who can do anything that they want to or try to even if its their very first attempt at doing it that fail to connect with audiences because no on can relate to them on any level. man or woman.
kate beckinsale is one of my favorite action heros since Ive been an adult male and its not because of the tight outfitshe has way more talent and brains than jennifer will ever have.
as a straight up  80s baby I can honestly say life was so much better before social media... nowadays everyone s narcissistic  scared  and will try every excuse to not have to take responsibility for their own obvious actions and shortcomings...
Im old enough to remember the 1970s black-sploitation films.   the first female action star was pam grier who played foxy brown in the movie foxy brown way back in 1974.edit  you can see the trailer here  https   www.youtube.com watch v smjcorshtsc
there s another quote from jennifer lawrence thatseems relevant. I never feel very smart because I dropped out of middle school.
I forgot about terminator!!!
and pam grier  and uma thurman  and lucy liu  and cameron diaz  and drew barimore  and charlize theron  and milla jovovich  and angelina jolie  and bridget fonda  and geena davis  and zoe saldana  and jodie foster  and meryl streep  and sandra bullock  and halle berry  and rachel mcadams  and diane lane  and ashley judd  and keira knightley  and kate beckinsale  and...
and kate beckinsale  angelina jolie and milla jovovich.
I really appreciated her performance in metropolis. also  I have to add thatshe s holding up very well for someone in her hundred-and-twenties.
and gina davis... playing an ass kicking pirate.
@seafarer64  omg - I forgot about gina davis!!!!  she was 10x the action star in the long kiss goodnight than lawrence could ever hope to be.
geena davies - long kiss goodnight  excellent flick
@me myself i  yes my guy  kick ass movie.
legit 2 of my childhood idols. sigourney weaver and linda hamilton  strong  caring about others above themselves  intelligent  focused and so freaking charismatic. what the hell gives anyone the right to write them off  I would have a heart attack meeting either of these trailblazers. but I d probably just walk away from jen.
lmao
considering she is naturally a brunette
@allennium falcon   haha haha shes smoking something it must be good
@spartan300   blond is a memory upgrade... and it failed!
@spartan300  most blondes are lol.
if it weren t for jlaw y all wouln t own electricity in your houses
yas queen
damn al gore.  she invented the internet as well imho!
but what is a woman
@stankey poosea  I ll have to get back to you on that one
@madmasterporkey  its not like we are all a biologists  like jennifer is.
@dan dare  fun fact  jennifer lawrence invented biologists.
the first man   woman created by God were adam   jennifer lawrence.
they were only recently invented  so we dont know yet lol.
no she thinks no human beings existed before she was born
@crash daddy  roflmao
inventing women is tight!
@st 1804  how
@andrew becerra  I dont know.
@andrew becerra  I dont know Im ashamed. one of the most awesome female lead characters.
@upstomp  yeah  and also cynthia rothrock is one of the og s was kicking ass long before she was born and is like her grandma s age now
jamie lee curtis  true lies . the  halloween  series is horror thriller  which is kinda action  but same category as alien and terminator.
@seafarer64   cutthroat island
not to mention all of them fantastic people  leading in cult classics.
mrs doutfire....
dont forget she opened the door for linda carter. carrie fisher    pam grier. thank you jennifer
just wanna point out that ripley from alien isn t a action movie its a science fiction movie or a creature feature. when it 1st came out and even tell pretty much recently its never been considered an action movie. so by technical standard you guys keep throwing alien with ripley and its not considered action it was considered scifI or horror. so you guys are very wrong anyways going on social media and bashing people especially when you say that youre some kind of person who believes in God thatshould mean you follow the rules of God and God isn t really too good with the whole trashing other human beings youre supposed to forgive and forget and turn the other cheek and instead you just bark like the dog you are. also terminator since you said that too sarah connor was not considered the lead character arnold schwarzenegger. so once again youre also wrong thats not the lead character kate beckinsale was not the lead character in underworld by the way if you actually check in the credits they actually have the main character as the head vampire. make sure you get your fax right before you talk
@truth facts  I am atheist. fine then foxy brown 1974. also in terminator kyle reese was only there to protect sarah connor. he even dies close to the end. he isn t even the one that kills the terminator. the story is  100 about sarah connor.
@upstomp  I was about to type all these awesome female action star names ...u beat me to it ...niiiiiice!!
@m862 msar  facts
@upstomp  and barbara stanwyck and marylin monroe and bette davis and ingrid bergman...even in the decades most infamous for their sexism  women had leading roles in movies.
apparently jennifer lawrence also invented time travel considered alien came out decades ago
the worst thing is thatshe is showing herself as someone who redeemed women  when she was shown in various interviews saying thatshe was more than close friends with harvey weinstein and  he was the best in hollywood. because of that man was created the movement  me to  the movie industry is giving more prominence to women because of thatscandal  as compensation
dont forget chlo  grace moretz  who at the age of 13 was the female lead of the 2010 adtion movie called kickass
sharon stone - basic instinct. going a little suspense there.
agreed   or when jennifer lawrence was in the asylum in terminator 2 getting all yoked out.
no  ur wrong! it was jennifer lawrence who gave birth to the alien queen first! lol
she was great too when launching her shakraam on ar s  fighting him with her friend gabrielle  which she was playing too  and hercules and yolas !
hey  you guys forgot when the alien queen  who was also jennifer hissed back at  jennifer when she said  get away from her you bitch! .
she also played a great red sonia and even had the mighty scharzenegger as a sidekick!!luckily she invented colour film too or we may have had grey sonia.
@bemused kidney
@kjpdavies
when she stared blankly at the camera and I said  wow such emotion .
I think when I was a kid the first action girl film was barbarrella with jane fonda and then I think it was goldie hawn in the sugarland express.
get away from her  you bitch!  is one of the greatest moments in cinematic history.
plus sw did it in alien ...a classic movie  not hunger games twoddle
exactly  alien gave sigourney weaver a lead role but it wasn t damaged by woke bullshit
ik jlaw def wasn t the first but tbf aliens wouldn t fall into the action genre  its sci-fi... if we re being technically accurate.
@john buck  yeah youreally believed ripley could take charge of thatship. without belittling those she was in charge of and all that nonsense empowered women say todau
@greasy guido  literally aliens is a sci-fI action movie
@greasy guido  and hunger games definitely isn t really an action movie either
@alexandro corona  lmao fair point
in this case the interviewer is similarly deluded actress viola davis. Im pretty sure she made comments in a similar vein just a few months ago when she was promoting her latest film  woman king   something to the effect of that her role as a black female action lead was somehow breaking new ground.
thats called a politician
@aliradicali  even worse  it was that if you didn t go and watch the movie  you were supporting the narrative that black women cant lead movies in hollywood. never mind the fact she made a movie lionizing one of the most prolific slave trading societies in the world.
or when she fought off michael myers in the closet in halloween 1978
or when she finally killed bill
@whitney pyant  yep
@james webb
hopefully you saw the babylon bee article on this topic   sigourney weaver thanks jennifer lawrence for paving the way for female action heroes
she was badass but I dont think there are more movies of her with these type of roles.
she would probably say aliens is sci-fI and not action lol
@kyle macdowell  lolol
remember when movies used to portray motherhood as one of the highest of virtues  action movie moms were absolutely not to be fucked with.good times.
let s also not forget linda hamilton as sarah conner in the terminator movies  doesnt get much more badass than these two women!
@luke smith  right. its a sci-fI horror action movie. hunger games is a distopian sci-fI action movie.
@greasy guido  fotflmao!! so pick one of the other hundreds of film. Imean  look at chinese media as well  many female names in main roles in action movies. total bs.
@brian worden  there you have it  exactly. aliens is way more action than the science part of sci-fi
yeah... but only in aliens she was really great  because the movie was great  after that it went downhill fast. aliens 3 was very bad already  it was in a weird way absolutely boring   but the forth installment was a clown show  one of worst movies I have ever seen.
there was another to quote yoda. sara conner and im sure there s more just cant think right now
barbarella supergirl

understand your point  but I think aliens is just overrated. to me it was just a female rambo out in space.
not as good as jennifer  lawrence. not a ground-breaker!!
@john buck  exactly
that is like saying jamie lee curtis because she played laurie strode  that dont really count. kill bill  uma thurman was the first true female action lead.
@not this time  why doesnt laurie strode count
whoever trusting celebrities needs a check up as well.
Im genuinely starting to believe movies stars dont have brains.
what brain
@alex  exactly. that is the point.
well when you sleep your way to top...
hands are still empty
@ugo strange   ohhhhhh shi
also many other actresses played lead or major roles in action movies before hunger games. pam grier was the first female action lead  as far as I know. ripley  weaver  was the first well-written woman character as an action lead. women played major roles in movies as early as the 1930 s  not only dainty housewives but also more powerful figures in society. in a few classic movies  30 s-70 s  the major woman character even kills the male lead.
@null conflict   100  all of this.
@null conflict  I dont think ripley in alien is a great example of a well-written female protagonist. afaik  all of the roles were written gender neutral and they simply cast whoever gave the best performance. hat tip to whoever cast jennifer lawrence  but I think ripley in the first film comes off as distinctly un-feminine  and a bit autistic  . consider how she seems determined to leave her crewmembers outside on the planet because of quarantine protocol  while the rest of the human crew is hysterical because their crewmate is outside  apparently dying. ripley in aliens feel a lot more like a female protagonist  because at that point she was written as one.for my money  I prefer sarah connor in t1 2 as a great early example of a strong female action hero  because the narrative deals far more directly with issues like motherhood  the conflict between being tough and nurturing  etc.
pam grier and even jane fonda.
@aliradicali  thats an interesting observation about ripley being a bit autistic. it wasn t thatshe showed signs of autism  she was just a  by the book  person. which that in itself is interesting because if anyone would ve bene the by the book person it would ve been ash and well...we see how ash turned out.  events of alien changed ripley to how she s portrayed in aliens. un-feminine...considering the what the movie  and everything  I wouldn t have expected her to be feminine or look much feminine. if anyone looked unfeminine it was lambert. but sigourney weaver comes off as feminine in alien  she s just a little more  hard-looking  because of the role. but maybe I look at it differently then you do with women today in action roles have to look very feminine as well as actually looking it vs back in the day.
she s just so amazingly stunning and brave and also amazing
I doubt she does either of those things.
you know a long time ago women used the be computers
she can divide by 0 and taught chuck norris tang soo do.
of course she understands algebra she discovered it
wasn t she also the first woman to be online
@michael fink  I doubt you understand jokes
@blacklives orblackvotes  best joke I have is my sex life
@james goodman  hahahahah  nice one!
I remember well. I saw it at the theater. the scene where sam jackson sings the song about the keys and the car is so funny.
never seen her do either  so I ll with hold  judgement for now.
sadly the first to crash a car too...
that is woke hollywood for you these days  everyone is a diva .
she was racist to us peruvians assuming namor was
not just that  she inspired real life women as well  like hatchepsuth  joan of arc and catherine the great... all thanks to jennifer!
more brain than jlaw is not a very high difficulty
and can shoot guns without flinching
there were 3 underworld films starring kate before 2012 and a 4th that year.clearly  jlaw time travels and self inserts.
when did you transition
Im not old enough to recall those films. but from an early age I fell in love with asian cinema and thanks to dvd s I was able to enough many females in action leads. I canthink of several michelle being one of them hell you can go back further and mention lily lI who was fantastic in her action roles not only as a supporting cast member but the staring role in several  .
if youre counting global cinema  lady snowblood  which was a huge influence on kill bill  came out in 1973. there was also the female prisoner scorpion series  which started in 1972.
@lokI trickster g  yes I kinda remind that film.. puts me in mind of lone wolf and cub. I prefer the much flashier kung fu fighting which is why Imentioned lily li
man  pam grier was a hottie. I remember watching those films back in the day.
wong.....mary poppins
I loved foxy brown.  so glad that jennifer opened the door for pam as a female lead actress.
never seen it  but the trailer looks good.
ah  that explains a lot
I just cant wrap my head around how she doesnt even think of the movies before hunger games.
thanks  for identifying another of those takes that tries to convince us that   this didn t happen before we thought of it.  one of my students recently asserted that her generation was the first to marry solely for love.
by the way  I love sigourney weaver s reaction to this  interview   where she thanked jennifer lawrence for leading the way for her  when she played the leading role in alien in 1979  when j.l. herself was born in 1990... also  no male ever identified with a woman before  especially when it was captain kathreen janeway from  voyager  or lara croft from tomb raider  oh wait...
congratulations to melanie on being the first female on youtube!
cant remember her name but even the female character in the original nightmare on elm street was pretty badass. she faced her fears and even went into the dream world to confront freddie kruger. sure the end wasn t great for her but she still did it and wasn t sanctimonious about it.
she is just so stunning  brave  and inspirational.  she was up against such odds knowing that it wasn t going to work.  Im retired and would like to thank most of women bosses I had over my lifetime.  the last of which proved thatshe was just as greedy as her male counterparts.  my first professional one was fantastic.
dont really know how this will come out but I ll try. the reason so many people love the older action women is because of character arc and story. you take someone who has limitations and isn t better than men in attitude and strength and they grow out of necessity to overcome challenges and go beyond what we believed they were capable of because of the circumstances in which they found themselves. women in particular exemplify this in a well written story and men appreciate the transformation and fortitude.thats why ripley is perhaps the best action movie heroine of all time and sarah conner falls closely behind. many successful movies starred women because they told the story well. these women didn t hate men or outdid them when paired. they grew and rose up because of the challenges they faced and became legends.jl wasn t very smart in this video and I hope she gives other women their due in the future. ngl I also liked the hunger games so she really didn t need to go there. she either has a break from reality or has been told so many times thatshe did pioneer this thatshe actually believes it.
jennifer lawrence doesnt talk about her first period she talks about the first period.
I agree. its really sad to see how people try and erase other films like this. movies like alien  the terminator  and la femme nikita are three of my favorite films and they have been making female lead action movies for years. a good example is in anime and manga where females have been the leads in action based stories for decades. great video!
watching  linda hamiltons  transformation  from  t1 waitress    to t2  badass  was  just amazing  for me it was one of the best parts of the movie.
congratulations to jennifer lawrence for this monumental achievement! ripley would be proud of her.
I have not laughed so hard in a loooong time! ths is gold!
I heard that xena warrior princess was put on hold until the director could watch hunger games  at which point they went back in time and green lit the franchise and encouraged the alien movie to change ripley to a woman. so brave. so stunning. she invented female action heroes and time travel.
without hunger games  we wouldn t have lara croft so grateful thank you jennifer!!!
it is impressive thatshe can know so little about the work she is involved in and still earn money doing so.
wow . ..... and to think  for a minute there we didn t even know what a  woman    was. glad she is here now to clear this up.
I laughed so hard when I heard the interview. how dare she say she s the first women in an action movie.. did she live in a hole all her life  didn t she have a tv or went to the movies  hahaha
I heard this and I was like really   youre an actress and you are expected to know something about the history of cinema.  everyone who heard this immediatedly named female action stars from the last 30 years.  its actually hilarious she s being serious.
why are we coming down so hard on jennifer lawrence   she freed the slaves  she invented math  and the only reason the world currently has colors is because she willed it.  we owe her a great deal.
so bold! so strong! so brave! so fierce! so stunning!  she was the first to be all of this!! her  leaks  kinda  show that maybe she kneeled her way up the ladder  but anywho...she takes herself way too seriously. as you said  she has zero cognizance of all those women that paved her path!
I dont think she knows or cares about movies she hasn t starred in. you might think that hollywood actors would know a lot about cinema  watch a ton of movies  have a professional interest in the topic  etc. but apparently thats not the case for most of them.
dude  dont u know that by now  jlaw invented hollywood...only 10 years ago...apparently.
she was the first movie star didn t you know
y know I kinda find it funny though that I never actually saw hunger games
@stick the landing  just watch battle royale instead. it is superior in every way.hunger games stole its interesting premise from a better ip  mixed it up with generic teen dystopian fiction tropes and then let it all out like a wet fart.the story goes nowhere  the premise is completely wasted and the worldbuilding is shit.
thats funny  considering how shallow  selfish    materialistic the modern generation is.
@brian valencia  for real
so are we to assume her parents didn t have a stable relationship
I dont know if I would laugh or cry if I heard that from a young person.
@revolvingworld  it was an arranged marriage  silly. you seem to forget that  before 2022 everyone was betrothed by the age of eight for financial or dynastic reasons.
@raylan givens  I did try though it was a fool s errand. she already knows it all.
oh she did ! haha please give us the link
heather langenkamp. to be fair  jlaw said action  that is horror and robert england was really the star.if we include horror  jaime lee curtis in halloween.marilyn burns from texas chainsaw massacre.and on and on...
looool
the long kiss goodnight  was an enjoyable one too.
sadly not that many film s to note   - trinity from the matrix aka the rabbit
haha thank you so much!
@melonie mac go boom  please continue to always be yourself. never change for anyone   and calling it right now  the 17th. you ll hit 100k on the 17th. let s see if Im right. if not... oops  but Im rootin  for ya  melonie!
I wouldn t be shocked if jl spent more time looking at herself in the mirror than watching a movie screen or tv.you might assume that movie stars would be passionate about cinema  but apparently an awful lot of hollywood actors dont care about their craft at all  its just a means to fame and fortune to them.
most of them did. a hole made of people telling her how great she is her whole life.
I read that as invented meth which would have explained a lot.
@nobody of consequence  a connoisseur  perhaps  but not the inventory.
how did viola davis just sit there nodding and not call her out  like viola knows  she s seen the 80s
when she wonthe match of the century and shouted out   yo  adrian! I did it!  I nearly choked up a cup full of tears. holy cow!
when I saw when she played the lead of underworld at 13  I cried tears of joy.
just to add to the list of names  michelle yeoh in tomorrow never dies in 1997  also mira sorvino in the replacement killers in 1998. cynthia rothrock was a martial arts movie star in the late 80s and 90s.
can we all just take a moment to show appreciation for jennifer lawrence   we now have so many wonderful women thanks to her
deep condolence to her parents  all their time and sacrifice for having this 1 brain cell jennifer lawrence as their child.
I guess linda carter  wonder woman 1975  and  lindsay wagner   bionic woman 1976  didn t get the memo. of course there a multitude of others  the reason this happens is that they start feeding on each other trying to show whos more in touch with the cause or the pain or whatever they are talking about. it happens all the time they are just bullshitting each other. best wishes mel.
if she was the first woman  I can just hear adam s response in the garden of eden hearing her speak for the first time   pass
here are some fun random facts I found out about jennifer lawrence  feel free to add any if you know them    she wrote and did the chorus for the hitsong  somebody s watching me  by rockwell in 1984  she stormed the beaches of normandy pre d day to scout ahead for the us invasion forces  she discovered and patented both the ac and dc for delivering electricity  she was an important vote in getting the 19th amendment ratified  she played the lute along side nero as rome burned  she perfected the equation e mc 2  einstein originally had it has e c 2 m. she said it was cuter her way
she is so brave for being the first. this is so powerful.  melonie you crack me up. and jennifer is delusional . great video melonie. good to see you. you look good. take care. have fun today.
she was also the first woman to ever give birth.  she actually gave birth to herself.
I give jennifer my best sarcastic golf clap for all she did for humanity.
I was curious to see who was really the first female lead action movie star. it looks like it was pam grier from the 1973 blaxpoitation film coffy  if we are looking at the official action movie genre.but if we go back to movies with action elements then it appears to be evalyn knapp in the perils of pauline  a 1933 film serial.
she s the bestest ever at literally everything. just ask her  she ll tell ya about it!
if only their iqs matched their egos.
its 1979 - a space tanker is flying through space - third in command is warrant officer ellen ripley - throughout the film  we see ripley demonstrate intelligence  endurance  courage  determination  compassion - through an application of all of these qualities  she defeats a terrifying nemesis - with every metric that can be applied  she is a hero on a quest - not once did she have to sacrifice her identity as a  woman  to achieve her goal - I admired and identified with ellen ripley - Im male  and in 1979 was 14 years old.hollywood needs to wake up and realize that males and females relate not to the exact representation they see on screen  but to the qualities the characters demonstrate ... unfortunately  we live in a time where hollywood films are populated with characters who have no qualities at all - so  they are not heroes  they are not on quests  the hero grows on a quest   they teach us nothing  and it is impossible for people to identify with them  or even like them.it also helps thatsigourney weaver is a fabulous actor - can hollywood please go back to giving roles to actors who are actually good at acting
all she had to say was something along the lines as   it was an honor to follow in the footsteps of all the female action heroes that came before me.  but no  she had to say that and make a fool of herself.
wow I vividly remember rewatching the first 3 underworld movies with lead kate beckinsale ad nauseum while growing up and the resident evil movies with mila jovovich buuuut that must have all been a fever dream
Im so thankful to jennifer lawrence  because she allowed you to have your own channel  the first time a woman was allowed to speak
she better get a patent for it asap or at least a trademark
movie star is a stretch. I like me some rothrock  but her films were mostly straight to video  but the point stands.
well  technically those were tv shows and not movies.  but yes  and both characters would kick the snot out of katniss everdeen.
charlie s angels had 3 women leads
or  how many rerolls do I have
@the ultimate fox  or   God  did you take my broken rib for this
@grayfoxiii  adam  God can I please have my rib back
she is literally the 1st woman to eat the apple of sin. makes sense.
- neil armstrong was supposed to say  its one small step for a man  one giant leap for jennifer lawrence  but he flubbed his line.
she was also the founding member of the band ac dc and wrote  produced  sang  and played every instrument of their debut album.
she s eve s mother  invented shotokan  founded the cobra kaI dojo and invented gravity. on her lunch break no less!!!!
she invented chuck norris.
she invented and subsequently mastered half of all known martial arts
she invented tampons and told the men at d-day that they could use them to plug bullet holes. thats big brain activity right there
after shooting  the tomb raider   angelina jolie pulled her face mask off and revealed thatshe was actually jennifer lawrence  the first woman  the only actress in za warudo
@marshall  nevermind that  as we all know he was the first man to step on the moon but she was already there waiting for him
lol
1974 - pam grier in foxy brown - so not only 38 years earlier  but also a black female action lead!  angelina jolie stared in 5 action movies before 2012  such as lara croft  tomb raider in 2001and salt in 2010.  sigourney weaver starred in 4 alien movies  all before 2012.  nikita 1990 and the american remake of it  point of no return  in 1993.   demImoore in g.i. jane  1997 .  milla jovovich in 5 resident evil movies on or before 2012 plus ultra violet in 2006.  the list goes on and on and on...  lawrence should be shamed for trying to steal that away from many far better and more deserving women.
charlies angels  wonder woman and the bionic woman from the 70s spring to mind and barbarella starring jane fonda from the 60s. she was on about western cinema and Im sure there s been many other movies with female action lead leads from around the world.
wow... imagine getting a lead role in a film for teens and bragging about it for the rest of your life. this woman is truly a legend.
she s 32  and working in the film industry since her teens  and she apparently knows jack sh!t about the history of film.now she s blaming it on being intimidated by her highly accomplished interviewer.
people never made movies before jennifer lawrence. wonder how her genius mind conjured up the idea of becoming an actress. truly  inspirational!
as a man that identifies as a lesbian apache helicopter the most represented I felt in a movie was blackhawk down that was such a stunning and brave helicopter that gave its life for thatscene. so sad lmao
breaking news  jennifer lawrence has more experience with harvey weinstein s joystick  then forming congregant sentences.
the worst part is thatshe was using her first female lead in an action movie comment to falsely indict men or at least hollowood as being unable to watch movies with a female lead before she did it.
I am so grateful as a man  thatshe allows us to exist  so we could admire and adore her
odin - the all-fatherjennifer lawrence - the all-motherhow do feel about being made from such a groundbreaking person  melonie
I think charlize theron doing arrested development was the best thing she has done ever.
jennifer lawrence also invented water. and since it is a bit of a hassle that itsometime is wet too  she went at the same time and was the first one to use ice.
Im pretty sure thatsigourney weaver and linda hamilton have her beat by a few decades  if we are being technical fay wray in king kong was the first female action star. lol
cheng pei-peI  known by many as the queen of kung fu  is the first-ever female action hero. the chinese actress appeared in a number of martial arts movies while working in hong kong in the 1960s and 1970s  ultimately starring in two of the most influential kung fu films ever made  come drink with me and crouching tiger  hidden dragonits good to see jennifer lawrence did her homework before spouting off.
selene in underworld is one of my favorites   and let us not forget agent dana scully in the x files movies as well as the tv series.
you nailed it lady boom while jennifer is existing in some alternate universe.
bridget nielsen in red sonja fighting against arnold schwarzenegger  cynthia rothrock in a lot of martial arts movies back in the 80 s  obviously those came out after jennifer set the world straight.  thank you jennifer for letting women be in action movies lol .  peace and love y all
everyone remembers aliens but dont forget buffy. and of course xena on tv.jlaw would make a great press secretary. her ability to not know history or lie about it would fit right in.
milla jovovich starred in the resident evil movies as the main action hero in 2001  and made six of those movies.kate beckinsale started her underworld movie series in 2003  doing four all together  starring as the main action hero.
I was working as a short order cook and had an idea on how to make grabbing our to-go boxes a little easier. I turned to the cook beside me and said   hey  what if we xyz the to-go boxes  ... the  cook immediately hollered over at the owner and said   I just had an idea  what if we xyz the to go boxes  ... the owner said   yeah do it . I then asked him   how did you think of that  ... he said   I dont know  it just came to me... people are crazy.
who is that interviewer anyway
@screw you guys  Im going home  viola davis. who nodded  affirmed  and encouraged what jennifer was saying.
she s dodging accountability
where s kratos when we need him
they made alien and terminator 2 before jennifer lawrence was born.
dont forget milla was in 5th element
@shane douglas  affirmative  but she was not the main star and lead of that particular movie  bruce willis was.
lately  Ive been really enjoying your videos. subscriber count is almost at 100k. well done  melonie!
she doesnt look old enough to have started in 1975-1979  wonder woman.  lynda carter
the line in anemia from tool about actresses like this is 100  accurate.
off the top of my head the earliest female action hero in a major feature film is maureen o hara in  the sons of the three musketeers  in 1952 - one counts blanche sweet as the eponymous  judith of bethulia  in 1914  she decapitated an assyrian general  but the guy was drunk at the time so it was not exactly a fair fight. anyone know of any earlier contenders
I love how you laughed so much you cried! we re right there with ya.
I know thatshe isn t the sharpest tool in the box  but on the other hand for at least 40 years we have been receiving quality content in all of the forms of media and it keeps piling up! there s not enough time to be aware of it existing  let alone consume it! I have a huge pile of books  manga  movies  tv shows  video games and anime that is sitting there   ...menacingly!   in the corner  waiting its turn. unlike jennifer  I dont speak about it  unless Im already somewhat familiar with whatever it is.so while I dont fault jl for not having seen alien s  or  the  terminator or things like that  I still haven t read ass of ursula k. leguin s  eathsea  books  for instance   I do fault her for having a strong opinion on a subject she knows fuck-all about.
also brigitte nielsen in red sonja. diana rigg as mrs peel in the avengers 1960 s tv show. peel is a strong heroine  she is rarely defeated in fights and is capable of rescuing steed if he is in trouble. she is a master of martial arts and a formidable fencer.
. . . in fact movies weren t even invented until 2006.  - jennifer lawrence
recently just found your channel. love your content! keep up the good work!!
jennifer lawrence has always been known to make crazy comments like this during interviews. someone needs to tell her that youre supposed to drink after the interview is over not before.
Im amazed there was no mention of tomb raider in this video!then again lara croft didn t exist until jennifer lawrence wished it into existence. so she does deserve credit for it.
what would 1940s serials like zorro s black whip  action movie serial with a female lead  do to these women s view of reality.  thanks melonie.  enjoying your channel.
jennifer lawrence taking time out of her busy day to show us all why celebrity opinions are better than ours!
breaking   power fantasies  with no story or supporting cast is the gold standard of storytelling.
I love thatshe s getting roasted for this  it is probably one of the most brain dead takes we have ever heard
thank you jennifer lawrence for inventing sliced bread.
brigitte nielsen in red sonya  sigourney weaver in aliens  lucy lawless in xena  etc etc etc.
your reaction is the closest to mine that Ive seen. just so baffling and hilarious. it doesnt even seem like reality.
people working in the field of quantum physics are also actively studying jennifer lawrence... as her very existence might be the key to truly understanding  retrocausality
there was a time when I didn t know what kind of person jennifer lawrence was  and I was happy
calamity jane maybe
maureen o hara was awesome. she was considered  one of the guys  by actors like john wayne for God s sake.
wasn t jennifer the first woman to walk and chew gum at the same time ...absolutely amazing!
I also felt so inspired when jennifer lawrence invented conductor  the color blue  the greek alphabet and my left shin.
I d take one melonie  over ten thousand jlaws.  just sayin .   keep rockin  it  mel.  youre a beauty in every possible way.
that jujukaI joke almost went over my head... Im ashamed.
make 90 s movies great again
jennifer lawrence  Im the first female action star. michelle yeoh  have a seat  sweety. we need to talk.
one of the characters thatspeaks to me and makes me feel represented is merlin from the adventures of merlin  and he is nothing like me. he s a white wizard male in a fantasy land...not a single thing matches but he s one of my fav characters ever.
long kiss goodnight was one of my favourite movies as a kid  she was badass
yo underworld kate beckinsale movie was awesome!  how could jenn not have seen that movie!
1 16the character I relate to the most in any series Ive ever watched is a pink cat lady called princess carolyn... but according to the only female in the world  there s no way a brown cisgendered male like me would ever feel related to a wo... wo... sorry... woman  I almost died writing that word
I need to thank jennifer lawrence for being alive. idk why but I somehow know she is responsible for my existence
that intro proved to me for two minutes that coke cantravel in my mouth  up my throat  and out my nostrils along with mucus. and that my keyboard is also waterproof.
she deserves everything she gets.
also this reminds me when cw charmed tried saying they out did og charmed and discredited og charmed as not feminine enough.
shows you just how far celebrities are from reality.
she was the first woman to lift up the sword of omens and scream hoooooooo
I was with my dad about this interview and told me about some silent films with female leads. they ve been around for a long time.
when I was like...5 my aunt was visiting and told us she was pregnant with my cousin. and I remember  very distinctly saying   Im going to be an uncle!  and everyone laughing at me and going   no...your a cousin. I feel like publications thatsay stuff like  this is the first x female in y role ever!  when there like 3 or 4  decades late  its a little bit like me being woefully mistaken about my familial relationships. except I was 5 and they are being paid to write...so...no idea what there excuse is.
this video made me crack up laughing. from the thumbnail to the sarcastic comments  this vid is gold! thanks for the laughs! sigourney weaver taking on the mother alien epic boss fight!
my brain is oatmeal. Ive never had to use it  ya dig  Ive gotten a free ride because of my looks  and boy  is that painfully obvious at the present moment.  had she just come right out and said it  it couldn t have been any funnier.
Im just happy you caught on when you did because I haven t seen anyone else in the comments recognize my joke in that
@melonie mac go boom  well  to be fair. I didn t know you watched anime. I dont really use socials  so if you ve talked about it on there  thats why. so  perhaps your viewers primarily dont either. lmao
jennifer lawrence auditions for the role of eve
hey a new video. Im glad youre talking about this. you look great melonie
it gets way better when you consider who she s speaking to.  thats pam grier.  she was foxy brown.  that movie came out in 1974.
I have no idea if lawrence is lying through her teeth to pad her credentials  or if she s legitimately that ignorant. but yeah  the woke people do this all the time  constantly erasing the past to make themselves look like trailblazers. Im sure we still remember black panther being labeled as the first black superhero  even though blade came out 20 years prior  you also had stuff like the damon wayans superhero comedy blankman  if that counts.
you know that phrase about  reinventing the wheel    well  no one could do that as well as jennifer lawrence  who originally invented the wheel centuries ago.  she also coined the phrase  I cannot tell a lie   which would later be used by george washington.
this interview was like some comedic skit in a satirical film.  wtf.
jennifer lawrence is insane. she s lost it. she s gone  real gone
stunning and brave.  I clapped!
youre killin it melonie
I like listening to jennifer s 5th symphony  sometimes known as beethoven s 5th  because a man stole it from her. sigh
the countdown to 100k is on!! I bet by the 17th you ll hit it! let s goooo  melonie!!
jennifer lawrence really is the woman of all time.
remember when jennifer invented the wheel  and showed us men what s what  good times.
I reckon she has achieved a lot due to nepotism  or a similar means. she had enough power to refuse the blue make up to play mystique. there s no way she s gotten there without an in.
all of a sudden  parts of your body is how yourelate and can be entertained  no longer ... you know... emotions  situations  and experiences.
jennifer lawrence just reached a new level of crazy lol.
respect for kill bill  terminator 1 2  alien  salt  tomb raider  crouching tiger hidden dragon  mulan  animated  and any movie before 2012 with awesome female action star leads who couldn t have been made without jennifer lawrence. sad I couldn t relate as a man to these amazing films about people  women  who had to overcome a situation or problems  or characters and stories that where entertaining  likable  relatable.
every 60 seconds in africa  a minute passes  - jennifer lawrence.
jennifer lawrence gave rosa parks her seat on the bus
Im a middle aged white man  always loved sigourney weaver  sanaa latham from alien v predator  then jyn erso from star wars rogue one. they seemed like natural heroes to me. girl heroes are great. I didn t realise this was an issue
is it really a surprise at this point Imean come on we all knew this was going to happen at some point.
damn  I remember during the american civil war  jl screamed at all the racist  misogynistic men. thats how the confederates lost the war .
good thing that jennifer lawrence invented time travel so those movies could be made
she was also rosa parks.  the first actor to do multiple roles as well  man thank God for her
stunning and brave
I would take red sonja over hunger games any day!!!
I guess I just imagined alien  terminator  nikita  underworld  alias  dark angel  charlie s angels and so many more... oh wow  other incredible news are coming in  samuel l. jackson will star in his second movie soon  yeah!
your such a legend I look forward to seeing your videos after seeing your views on religion. I feel I cantrust you
I also hear she is the first woman to give birth. before her everyone was like na it cant happen
sigourney weaver wants a word. linda hamilton wants a word. cynthia rothrock wants a word.
I d love to see a  thank you  video from sigourney and linda.
she is truly great and powerful
are there even people in the industry at this point who aren t this delusional !
hey melonie! I was looking forward to this one . have a great weekend!
rhona mitra in doomsday was a fun movie as well.
they want to keep us down  says the millionaire who has acted since her teens with nearly 2 decades of absolute privilege.
its time that you announce to the world that you are the first woman to be successful on youtube. how else are young women going to know the struggle and how it was done
congratulations melonie mac  on being the first female youtuber
alien  terminator  the net  ultraviolet  resident evil  underworld series  buffy  point of no return  double jeopardy  mr and mrs smith  just to name the ones I can remember. then again  I dont actually know anyone who  identified as   most probable reason is that I do not have a personality disorder and most certainly none of them looked at lawrence and  yuh  thats so me . but I have heard them say growing up  if I were a woman  I would want to be like them   even male movie action heroes   if I were to build up my body  I d love to look like x   not  oh  that is just so me!
google  did you mean counter-productive also  so many awesome older female leads besides the ones you named.laurie strode is one of my favorites.
it wouldn t work. so  how did itsuddenly start being able to work for hunger games
I guess we finally know what is a woman  lol
I laughed when you said jujutsu kaisen  I was just thinking of that literal seconds before you said it because of aoI todo
brave of her to open an opportunity for gina davis to star in a movie with samuel jackson about a wife who remembers shes an assassin .
hI  1st time here. I clicked on the video because I figured it was about that video and I wanted to laugh again  haha. I pretty much commented the same thing on a twitter post for it by another actor who wrote something like  no women in lead action role before  are you all high   lmao and there is people defending her who cant even listen to the interview properly and change her phrasing to make it ok. I swear gen z...edit  someone should remake scenes of all previous action movies with female leads with jennifer lawrence s head in place
uma thurman and kate beckinsale as well
@dubbcee1000  right !
finally!
@melonie mac go boom  yeah Ive been wondering that one.  even matt walsh has been asking
hImelonie  please pardonthe unrelated post. I recently stumbled upon simpcast  51. as a result  I have even more respect and admiration for the both of you and brittany ventI  posting same comment .there was an adult topic discussed  no  not the bottle game  heh  and you both clearly had the moral high ground. yes  that is partly an opinion statement  however  there were some gruesome and sick realities that one individual did not acknowledge very much  if at all. while Imay not have caught every word  that person emphatically stated it was a good thing and wouldn t budge on considering the behavior that the industry  within itself  attracts  encourages and promotes. thus I was disappointed. I agree with brittany  you watch that with a partner  you are both as good as a c---hold. when we cant agree on objective reality  then we start believing math is a social construct  among other things. its ladies like you that make men want to be more alpha. peace.
there were like 1200 female action stars before she was 9 kate beckinsale in leather still gets my engine running.
when women aren t the main character they were beating up men as secondary characters. and there were tons of tv shows where women beat up men left and right. xena warrior princess was worshipped by feminist homosexuals. buffy was explicitly made as feminist propaganda  they said it openly. charmed  three sisters beating the male demons and other men. btw  I do archery  and there s a reason women dont compete with the men - they are much worse. a 20-something woman has the grip strength of a 65-year-old man. they have 40  less body strength. you need to do weightlifting to handle a heavy  stiff competition-level bow  ordinary people have trouble just pulling the string. yet katniss does it like its nothing. it is typical in hollywood to show women handling bows with ease - easier to dupe people into thinking thats possible than them handling a sword.
I still cannot forget when jenny law brought about women s emancipation and the right to vote decades before she was born ! now thats how awesome she is
I think a lot of it comes down to the classic stars that understood just keep working keep auditioning getting roles like katherine hepburn and betty davis etc. who understood that there are hundreds of beautiful girls in california those that are consistently working will get those big contracts.  whether it is in anime or live action j lo sounds all sour grapes and butt hurt her window of being the beauty queen is closing so she has to reinvent herself and keep going after different roles.  makes you appreciate actresses like jamie lee curtis who get it that hollywood ebbs and flows hot one minute ice cold the next.  happens to the biggest stars in the business.  look at tom hanks over exposure how many movies has he been in 10 or 11 during the last 2 years.  you can burn the audience out on your movies.  whereas kurt russel and denzel washington space out there films much better.
dont forget chlo  grace moretz who at the age of 13 was the female lead of the 2010 action movie called kickass
ya know.  its a good laugh.  but for real - we are seeing a window into the mindset of current year entertainment thought processes
as meh as the movie was red sonya is the earliest one I canthink of mind you for action movies. 1985 Im sure there s ones before that  but would be wayyyy before my memory the first alien movie was 1979  but in fairness I dont see it as an action movie but horror sci-fi. the first movie that I recall that they had to do  we have woman!  was ghostbusters 2016 and look how great that turned out  yes thats sarcasm!
even though itsays 3.6k likes...  I am the very first person to ever like this video.
get away from her you beeeeeepppp.....  so sigourny weaver s line only exists in a parallel universe   must be a new mandela effect.
the old underworld movies with kate beckinsale were pretty awesome.
I remember jennifer lawrence in  gone with the wind  when she scream  I will never be hunger again!
hahahaha  Ive been waiting for this particular reaction!!! get her mel!!
she invented youtube!!
investing in crypto now should be in every wise individuals list  in some months time you ll be ecstatic with the decision you made today
can we create a series of jennifer lawrence jokes like chuck norriss I ll start jennifer lawrence is so amazing she gave birth to herself...
I liked her as mystique in the x-men prequels.
no  no - she invented the internet!
jennifer lawrence is having a picnic  minus a few sandwiches  one day in a peaceful meadow by a stream. another blonde arrives across the stream from her and yells  yoo-hoo! how do I get to the other side ! with a confused look jennifer replies  you are on the other side  silly!
pam grier was staring in action movies way longer than before jennifer lawrence was born
yesss!  haha thank you!
making money is an action. keeping money is a behavior   but  growing money is wisdom  I heard this from someone

@brokerharold
thanks for his info I ll get to him right away
wow  Ive seen a lot of recommendation about harold  is he really that good.
bots!!
I totally was rooting for the alien in alien and aliens because I couldn t identify with  sigourney weaver as the hero. I absolutely wanted the humans to die and the alien to win because there wasn t a male protagonist struggling against it.
horror-movies  especially slashers  did it first and best  its always the final girl that kills the bad guy and its never about beeing a guy or a girl
speaking facts... I dont remember seeing blade for the first time when I was like 9 and dont remember people saying   guess what  we have a comic book movie and its a vampire... wait and he is black!  it was just a good damn movie...  I am literally the same age as jennifer lawrence and this is annoying  but she is the first... the first to be overwhelming wrong about this subject .
this is what happens when a generation has nothing to rebel against  so they rebel against reality itself.
say it ain t so joe! so genuine as a rising star. holly-weird has got to her.
I related to angelina jolie in tome raider as a kid  she was not the first action hero but at the time she was special. no idea why..to be fair angelina jolie in hackers was my highlight  in film you can look at the early 1900 s for examples of women action heroes in film. never mind all the 80 s action films.
hey!!! great content and awesome channel... keep up the good work!!!
I way looked up to my mother  she traveled the world  was a business owner  and was wealthy. her ending just wasn t a happy one  unfortunately...
fun fact the actual first woman action movie lead  was 100 years before that.she also lied ability her getting paid less than her co-stars. passengers was basically her last  big  role and she was paid more than chris pratt .so yeah
she will never live this down. that is actually quite impressive if you think about it  she managed to piss off all men and all women with one statement you know thats thats something.
2 44 even the interviewer looks like she cant believe she s saying those things with  a straight face.
I never open my mouth in shock from stupidity but this video actually shocked me of how far out of touch she truly is
1967.  the viking queen   played by carita. if you check out the trailer you ll see her mow down dozens of roman legionaries with her spiked chariot. thats action!
this is what happens when you drop out of middle school to enter the hollywood bubble at the impressionable age of 14.
the thing that blows me away is the interviewer just sits there with a straight face and listens to this and doesnt burst out laughing or calls her out. this is how brainwashed these women have been from feminism telling them they are eternal victims
her ig fan club put out a post that was really rich saying she made a mistake and we choose love over hate  insert belly laugh
jennifer was awesome in kill bill as the lead.
the role was in monster  and charlize absolutely crushed it.
the movie at the end is  monster  the story about serial killer aileen wuornos. Christina riccI plays her girlfriend.
I cant believe she d never seen underworld in 2003.
just the first woman to figure out what to do with a period during that time of the month all women should thank her Imean she should get a standing ovulation for this!
alien...rieply. from what I understand the role was writen. men and women had auditioned for ripley.  but when sigourney read for the part  they had found ripley.
that intro has me dying
apparently jennifer lawrence was never raised by her mother because a normal person would say that their mother was their hero
at this juncture a wise move would be to just own up and say sorry - that is unlikely to occur.
remember when she was actually pretty cool  she was new to hollywood  and came across like one of us  who snuck into the party.now she s one of them. she s a product of their poisonous habit of not firing people or ditching bad products. the industry is filled with folks who fon t draw a crowd worth a lick  but continue to get work  because hollywood likes them  and doesnt recognize the fans as being more important.lawrence figured that out at some point  and hasn t stopped mouthing off ever since  because she knows as long as hollywood likes her  she ll never be out of a job. no matter how many times she deepthroats her own foot.
she never complained on harvey s casting couch  thats for sure.
the best performance she ever have us was when her cloud photos were  leaked ..
in her defense if you believe something to be true it isn t a lie   but ignorance is bliss right
!
jennifer lawrence is so amazing she actually taught God how to act...
I get the sense she d probably say that alien was an ensemble cast  and terminator 1 and 2 were both dual-led by hamilton and beihn  then by hamilton and arnold.  while she was the only lead in her movie.  or something.  anything to justify her position  really.
she also invented the couch interview.
I d love to write up a list of female characters that I as a guy can identify with. but that would take until Christmas.
hillarious  maybe jennifer has never seen any other movies before 2012.
this is the greatest channel Ive ever discovered  Ive never hitsubscribe faster iml holy crap
cant tell you nhow much I love you mekonie  keep up the good work!
when she said  its jlaw time!  and started jlawing all over the place.
before jlaw women had never been nominated or won academy awards. so stunning. so brave. trailblazer
can someone compile a list of such movies before 2012
tomb raider. underworld. resident evil. there are so many other examples that cant be rationalised away easily.I dont think this was a statement with some sort of clever pedantic argument behind it. I think she was fed lines like that during the promotion of hunger games and I think she s dumb narcissistic enough to have believed them.
I would say t2 was dual led.
her birthdate is known universally as  anno zero !!
such willful ignorance is astounding.  either willful ignorance on both their parts or they re such effing liars that they deserve zero respect.
maybe she can blow her way into reality like she did an oscar.
itseems like lead women characters in action movies are ridiculously overconfident these days.sigourney and linda s characters we re actually  scared  a good bit of the time in aliens and terminator.  which is how normal humans would react .showing emotions not only made them seem more realistic and interesting  it made me want to root for them more when they actually worked through their fears  and  conquered  their adversaries because they were strong women  and no one made a big deal about them being women!yep  some of my favorite women in action.
thank you jennifer   uma thurman
melonie youre a boss!
sigourney weaver  was the first I remember. when she duct taped a pulse rifle to a flamethrower  I felt like I had to stand up and applaud. lmfao.
if she thinks that than I can say I invented the microwave!
it would probably make jennifer lawrence s head explode to discover that in 1979 ripley in alien was originally cast as a man. the fact ripley became iconic regardless  should tell you something.
for jennifer there is no women s history month  its just jennifer lawrence month.
I know other people beat me to it rightfully so but sigourney weaver cannot be compared to when it comes to this  jessica alba as well was in many action movies  michelle rodriguez as well and I dont think a movie has to be lead by one person  you can have a few or more major characters
studio execs told her  it wouldn t work  were adapting a book to film that has a female lead but once you translate female from words to flesh-   before they could finish j law interjected saying  enough!  I will just have to show them all!   and made 3 completely chitty movies.
so glad she opened the doors for other women to be born
none of these women ever existed  ellen ripley  alien sarah connor  terminator kara zor-el  supergirl  natalie  dylan   alex  charlie s angels 2000 the bride  kill bill selene  underworld alice  resident evil lara croft  tomb raider violet  ultraviolet aeon flux   on flux elektra  elektra selina kyle  catwoman evelyn salt  salt mallory kane  haywire furiosa  mad max fury road lorraine broughton  atomic blonde the major  ghost in the shell diana prince  wonder woman alita  alita battle angel princess leia  star wars lucy  lucy lizbeth salander  the girl with the dragon tattoo fox  wanted trinity  the matrix baby doll  sucker punch yu shu lien  crotching tiger  hidden dragon hit girl  kick-ass letty ortiz  the fast and the furious leeloo  the fifth element sergeant rita vrataskI  edge of tomorrow natasha romanov  black widow the mcu nope. none of them ever existed at all.
reminded me with simu luI in shang chI  like he was the first asian action superhero.   never heard of bruce lee or jackie chan before
I can name 3 with just 1 series from 1976 - charlie s angels
jennifer lawrence  the first woman to wear pants. before her only men could wear pants no woman has broken that barrier.thanks to her dedication  devotion and sacrifices. women can wear capris which of course jennifer lawrence invented. she is a role model for young girls and she has changed the world for generations to come because of jennifer lawrence s contribution to society. if you doubt that just ask her.also  read about how jennifer lawrence is the first woman to drink water from a glass  now women dont have to go thirsty ever again.
so what s angelina jolie  chop liver  that was her thing  she was the action star - her and tom cruise. tomb raider  the cradle of life  mr   mrs smith  salt. did you forget about those movies jen
while its fun to laugh at j. law  its really variety to blame  as the clip was shared from their twitter acct  they would go on to delete the tweet after the backlash . the real question is  why  out of an entire interview  do they choose the clip that makes her look that painfully uninformed
this woman acts in them  but has never watched a movie in her life
thank goodness jennifer came along and led the way for all women for all time. Im sure she went back in time and told shakespeare to write macbeth  in fact  she probably ghost wrote it. she s just that great!although it does seem like her career went downhill with harvey. just saying.
fantastic video melonie.
pam grier was an action star before alien in the 1970 s
haha the title made me instatnly lose my coffee on my keyboard. thank you for the giggles. boys  usually cannot identify with a badly written character in a cringy  badly scripted and directed  mostly ripped off others  story  designed only to state a political message in the detriment of itself...
the  first  action led movie female was interviewed by the  first  woman king. what can you expect of this interview
mel is among the last few sensible women
kill bill is my favorite movie. beatrix kiddo is one of the best female leads in history.
damn jennifer didn t see alien s  sigourney weaver was amazing in that
mel putting shade on jen.
hey  at least jennifer lawrence didn t fall when she said this.
and melonie mac is the first live action gamer in history - Imean what other nonsense can people like jlaw come up with.
preach girlfriend
I loved jennifer as brad pitt s wife in mr.   mrs. smith
the act as if they re the first  thats what gets me. thats what really boils my juices.
I believe jennifer lawrence also invented the internet with al gore.
thats not out of touch  that is severe narcissism.  laurence doesnt care if the caca she spews is true as long as it benefits her.
Imean this is exactly why moved on to anime.
Im not sure if Im watching melonie mac or actually jennifer lawrence. Im so confused as surely jennifer lawrence is every woman..she was the first and only female youtuber..
curious about the earbuds and decision to use them!
so this entire time jennifer lawrence was the bride in kill bill instead of uma.
I always knew she was exceptional.
I didn t know you had eyelids melanie. looking great. God bless you
she s also the first woman to put shoes on both legs  before her  women used to just jump around.
iconic movie roles prior to 2015 long kiss goodnight  geena davis alien  sigourney weaver lara croft mrmrssmith salt  the jolie resident evil series  jovovich la femme nikita  anne parillaud run lola run  frankie potente terminator  linda hamilton underworld series  kate beckinsale mad max fury road  2015  theron kill bill  uma et al. the matrix  trinity was a big deal! played by carrie-anne moss man  just off the top of my head and just the ones that left an impression on me growing up. I think lawrence was sitting across from viola davis and could not help but to weave her weird narrative of oppression.  her narcissism was in full swing and she lost control.
the same was in rings of power. the first woman dwarf  d
for a good girl you sure have a biting sense of humor. remind me not to get on your bad side.
narcissim is the way!!   you are hilarious.
well  yes of course! been this way  ever since the great reboot of the entire world in the 2010 s... didn t you know    our entire continuity has been reset! so  in thatsense  she  is the first!
jennifer lawrence thinks they actually time travelled to film the x men movies.   probably
haiyo miyazakI film where all the main characters are female. yet everybody loves those films and can relate as well.
you can go back to hitchcock black and white movies from the 30s to see them leading in thriller   action mysteries.  it kind of bothers me that people dont even realize this and seem to think like sigourney weaver was the first. which I understand. we cant get to old or foreign for references otherwise most of people wont get it but you can literally prove this was a thing from the beginning of cinema. not just years before jennifer lawrence
forget Christopher columbus  jennifer lawrence discovered america!
charlie s angels  tomb raider  resident evil  underworld  aeon flux  million dollar baby  haywire . . . and those are just handful of female led action films between 2000 and 2011  never mind the decades prior  with the real heavy hitters .
easnt mary poppins  dorothy in the wizard of oz  and orphan annie lead roles.  I also remember michelle yeoh being an early action star in kung fu flicks
she was upset about women being payed unfairly in hollywood and how she felt underappreciated when  lo and behold  she was one of the highest payed actresses in history for her role as katp  s neverclean and was payed more than chris prat in that other movie that nobody really remembers.
lol that interview was hardcore cringe.the jujutsu kaisen thing made me lose it
shes only seen 3 movies in her life time the hunger games trilogy
I think jennifer s biggest contribution is securing the right to  vote  for women  well that and curing cancer.
the new biggest meme to now exist!
gary looked it up.lawrence only missed by literally 100 years
well she is exceptional in one respect. just not the good kind of exceptional.
franka potente not frankie.
its as if she s arguing  ripley  sarah conner  valeria  conan the barbarian   etc. we re all played by men or at the very least didn t exist.growing up  weaver  ripley  was the  dont f with me you alien bass-turd or Ima shove a grenade up your butt  bad ass. there was not one single girl I knew growing up who wasn t rocking ripley as we played. all the boys were aliens and ripley was tearing through the lot of us.movies today are no where as good as the 80-90 s. cg is nothing when the story and acting you get with it is crap.hollywood lost its flare for entertainment and sarah conner and ripley were the best female action roles ever.
hunger games was not an action movie  it was a drama series.
come on  guys. she only missed being the first major female action star by 33 years. it could happen to anyone
jennifer lawrence was mystique in the x-men prequels.
boys cant identify with a female lead.  the whole franchise of tomb raider begs to differ. not to mention decades of movies and tv shows with female action heroes with a mostly male audience. and the fact the other woman just noded and agreed with it blows my mind.
1979 alien- sigourney weaver1991 terminator 2- linda hamilton 2000 charlie s angels- cameron diaz  drew barrymore  lucy liu2001 lara croft tomb raider- angelina jolie2002 resident evil- milla jovovich2003 kill bill volume 1- uma thurman2003 underworld- kate beckinsale2004 catwoman- halle berrydo I need to keep going
I guess milla jovovich doesnt exist in jen s universe
I agree with everything said  but its a shame because I actually think she is a good actress. like  in passenger or dont look up. the x-men are ok aswell but passenger was a good sci-fImovie I loved it.
the most dangerous person is the person who can lie to themselves.
I guess I ll rip down the Christmas tree and put up a shrine for my true creator
dont you know  disa was the first female dwarf!  jennifer lawrence also invented everything first!
jennifer lawrence only watches jennifer lawrence movies because they are awesome  in her mind
we used to be an all male species that reproduced like the asarI from mass effect. then jennifer lawerence came and invented women.
how big-headed are you jlaw  yes
I think jlaw also never watched any horrors movies when the term  final girl  was invented and usually the last survivor is a girl
thank you  jennifer lawrence  for inventing my own mother. otherwise  I would not have been born.
insert leo d whistle meme  pam grier  sigorney weaver  tanya roberts  angelina jolie  mila jovovich  uma thurman  and also the fictional character motoko kusanagi.
I dont think she was even the first female action star of that year in 2012. underworld awakening came out a few months before hunger games.
didn t she make more than chris pratt in the movie she did with him  some movie about them on some spaceship  I could be wrong but I think she did.
disney  our black panther is the first ever black superhero film  ignoring meteor man  blade  spawn  hancock  etc. also  disney  our shang-chI is the first ever asian action film  ignoring bruce lee  jackie chan  jet lee  etc. films
at this point I believe its a valid question to ask whether jennifer lawrence has ever said anything intelligent
if youreally want to stump her  ask her to define  woman  on twitter
so  in jennifer lawrence s head eowyn  leia  ripley  sarah connor  jenette vasquez  april o neil  karaI  samus aran  sonya blade  kitana  buffy  dana scully  xena  gabrielle  lara croft  the bride  among many others dont exist. good to know.

everyone talking about alien but what about our warrior princess xena  she needs love too
she caught in a pickle talking about the pay gap too because it was revealed she got paid more than chris pratt for the movie they were in.
jennifer should have a look at this list.pam grier-foxy brown  1974  sigourney weaver-alien 1979  linda hamilton-the terminator 1984  brigitte nielsen-red sonja 1985  bridget fonda- point of no return 1993  sharon stone-the quick and the dead 1995  lorI petty-tank girl 1995  jennifer lawrence was only 5yo by this time. but I digress. pamela anderson-barb wire 1996  geena davis-the long kiss goodnight 1996  demImoore-g.i. jane 1997  milla jovovich-the fifth element 1997  cameron diaz  drew barrymore  and lucy liu- charlie s angels 2000  sandra bullock-miss congeniality 2000  angelina jolie-lara croft  tomb raider 2001  milla jovovich-resident evil 2002  kate beckinsale-underworld 2003  uma thurman- kill bill 2003  jennifer garner-electra 2005  charlize theron-aeon flux 2005  milla jovovich-ultraviolet 2006  angelina jolie-wanted 2008  angelina jolie-salt 2010   saoirse ronan-hanna 2011 but before all those wannabes  way back at the dawn of humanity in 2012 was spawned the original. thats right ladies and gentlemen. defying time itself  the first female action hero  katniss the great.this is in no way a complete list. and I didn t include all the sequels or huge franchises that came out of this list.
the narcissism is strong in jennifer lawrence.
I wish these so called journalists would bring up why this is bullshit  but of course everyone s so worried about access that they just never dispute anything  even something so obviously wrong as this. what a time to be alive....
jennifer lawrence invented time and gravity. gasp! she s a God! we would be lost without her. we must bow to her. all hail jennifer queen of all entertaining and stuff! real talk  I think she s a @    @!
who says americans dont do sarcasm excellent!
the 6 year old me looking up to sarah connor as the most bad ass hero ever disagrees with jennifer lawrence.
really bad thing is the movie she s speaking about hasn t aged that well. does anyone remember the hunger games with the same reverence given to alien aliens  the terminator 1 2  I  m old so I remember linda carter being the lead on a show called wonder woman ..... does she know about this show  there was also the bionic woman.  and airwolf ...nothing to do with women really but the theme is probably going through your head now  lol.
the interviewer could have asked her opinion on the alien movies and terminator. really  I never even thought about the gender and or race while trying to be entertained via cinema and gaming. the  woke  movement to me is just adding problems and issues instead of what ever it is they are trying to accomplish. I am a man  naturally I am wired differently than a woman  which itshould be. I need my woman to be strong  no doubt  but it ok to need me to hold her during tough times  I look into her eyes and confidently let her know its going to be ok.... she looks in mine to let me know she believes in me. dont be me  be everything that I am not. I wouldn t be mad if my lady didn t get in between me and danger  when instinctively l would take bullets  and any man dating my sister s  nieces  or cousins better have the same mentality.
nice one  melonie
this is what happens when you give a generation of kids participation trophys
I watched sarah jennifer connelly save her little brother toby from the goblin king david bowie from certain doom...my first female protagonist and luved it... david s pants could have been less revealing...
the last good movie that I remember her doing was the passenger  but crisp rat carried that movie.
guess she never heard of kill bill... 10 years before the hunger games. she really said that with a straight face. not only have we been doing that in the west with ladies like cynthia rothrock  the east has had some pretty awesome lady action stars too. like the legendary angela mao ying and the badass shihomI etsuko. if you cant find women kicking ass in movies  youre either just not looking or you have the ability to look people in the eye and lie without remorse. lawrence makes me sick.
odd because aliens and terminator 2 are 2 of my favorite movies and Im pretty sure both movies had awesome tough women in them.  or maybe Im remembering wrong.
not to mention the countless hong kong  martial arts films with a female lead going back decades!!!
I only included films where the actress gets top billing  sorry terminator franchise .
and they re still two of the best female action characters in movie history.
she also took credit for inventing the wheel.
she can reinvent herself.  why reinvent herself when she can reinvent everything and everyone else first  its just common sense  really. she was so good at it her actions went backwards in time to allow other  but still lesser  of course  female lead movies to exist.
I was born the same year as her four months older then her. she and I are the same age and even I know there are women in action movies before her. this is sad that a woman in her young 30s is that ignorant  egotistic  and idiotic.
the fnt chat on friday dec. 8th was lit with comments about what jennifer was first at. she was the first man who became a woman.
everybody wants to be the first. I remember when black panther came out. it was the first black super hero movie and they just pretended that blade didn t come out 20 years before.edit. can we add aeon flux to the list of female led movies. I love that one.
she does realize that the movies are based on a successful book series
imagine being so full of yourself and stoic with the satisfaction of your superiority  that yourefuse to even imagine the efforts of anyone else before you  the people who have paved the way for you  and then bring up the oppression of and rejection of women in hollywood to a black woman. regardless of how you feel  you have to see the irony in that.
how could she not know about previous movies before her where was she living on an amish farm community another thing she invented for the record btw  lol
its not beyond the realms of possibility that jennifer lawrence has never watched an action film thatshe didn t star in  so her delusion is not so unbelievable.
and the irony of  hasn t viola davis been kickin ass in her roles for many decades
I loved jenny the vampire slayer
Im just waiting for brie larson to come out as the first female action hero with captain marvel so that brie and jennifer can finally have their celebrity deathmatch...
Im a man and even Im a little peeved about this. some of my favorite movies had a female lead.
I love how the hunger games are movies about a fictional degenerate society suppressing working people made by a real degenerate society. sometimes I think many actresses didn t get the message of the movies.
and I guess those people also forget the fantastic metroid series... you know samus!
in her defense she was probably drinking before the interview
I liked and looked up to the ninja turtles when I was a kid  even though Imyself was not a turtle. ninja  maybe a wannabe haha. mutant  well thats debatable haha. its crazy  I thought I had to be a turtle in order to be inspired by them  weird
I think jennifer has never seen a movie she hasn t starrer
someone finally invented women! well hot damn  I love women! thanks  jennifer lawrence! jennifer needs to watch more movies  preferably ones with women in action roles. like aliens  t2  kill bill  and crouching tiger  hidden dragon. she has the time  her career is in a funk.you cant just stand in a forest and call yourself a trailblazer.
so this will be the new chuck norris contender
lol so true!
I was surprised viola didn t call her out. but then again she cant attack her own in-group.
I had never even seen a woman until jennifer lawrence got her first acting role.
wouldn t even considered hunger games an action movie. Imean  I guess. its more of that teen drama sort of movie like twilight and maze runner.
c mon baby  think about it  youre going to be the first female lead in an action movie all you have to do is...  - harvey weinstein  probably.
so it was revealed to me the truth in the beginning there was only jennifer lawrence and after she created the universe and everything that exists she left it to God to manage and so great was her goodness and humility thatshe allowed him to assume the authorship of creation.
as a man  I am unable to identify with a female lead in any video game or movie  which is a shame because I would love to have played the tomb raider games and watched movies like alien and terminator. oh wait  the tomb raider games and these two movie franchises are in my top favorite games and movies of all time. the only explanation must be that Im a woman trapped in a man s body.
give her a break after all  she invented the sun
no body talks about buffy  living in the 90s that tv show was huge and it had a female lead.
well then I better toss out my underworld and resident evil movie collection...
what s even worse in my opinion is the reaction of viola davis  and nobody seems to be talking about it. she agreed  100 . so that means she also thinks that. hollywood is sooo disconnected from reality  by itself its not that bad since they make fictional entertainment but if you dont know anything about reality  stop preaching to normal people. no matter how you look at this statement  all aspects and possibilities are bad.
I saw a video recently from fizz fop1 that touches on this subject  it was recently interesting!!!
I heard jennifer lawrance cantrace her reincarnation back to eve... lol
just wow! the arrogance levels are insane!
thatsickens me to the core because I loved even riply and if we need to go on the black front blade the modern world needs to grow up
I guess ripley from the  alien  franchise does not count  not lara croft  as you mentioned  not even samus aran from metroid. lelu from  5th element   la femme nakita  lesbeth from  the girl with the dragon tattoo  series  the bionic woman from the 70 s  charlies angels from the 70 s  jackie brown are some other female led shows movies that come to mind  that I guess do not matter.... all of which were before this losers time...
tomb raider  alien  terminator  supergirl  electra  catwoman  and so many more movies had female leads.  I hate it when actors fail to see anything that was before them.  in fact  I bet without those other leads  they never would have gotten in a movie like hunger games.
I tell my kids about when jennifer was the first woman to cross the atlantic in a plane.
the furies  1950   female protagonist  anny get your gun 1950 calamity jane 1953  western biopic action   granted   johnny guitar 1954 cat balou  1965   just 2 of a bunch of female lead westerns.  barbarella. 1968  female lead in a scI fI action movie.  a plethora of co-leads  like rooster cogburn  heck true grit could be argued as a female lead  though imho is an ensemble cast.
drinker s chat yesterday was filled with hundreds of memes on this lol
way to go jennifer  reinforcing stereotypes ... dumb blondes...   lol
sigourney weaver and linda hamilton were among the best action leads back then  period.  male or female.  jennifer lawrence is a milquetoast actor that I wouldn t have known existed had she not been so brash and arrogant.
damn movies like aliens  terminator 2  kill bill   and mulan never happen guys
you are so gorgeous  melonie.
what about sigourney weaver in the aliens franchise
I d say well over 50  of all action thriller horror movies released by major studios and streaming services in the past 10-15 years are female-led. just try browsing prime  netflix  hulu  etc...
one of the things I really hate is the projection feminists always do on male capacity to relate to female characters. for gamers males use any kind of character they like while the greatest chunk of women only play female characters.you watch a fighting game tournament and aside of low tier characters you have nearly the whole roster then you watch a female only tekken tournament and half the matches are xiaoyu vs xiaoyu. there s a meme in lol about female only teams being crap cause they cant find good junglers and top laners cause those positions are dominated by male characters and if they find a jungler she s surely an elise main you cant even make it up!!its not our problem a great chunk of women are unable to relate to male characters we already play everything there are more male cammys than female ryus
she is insane
j law is truly the bestest ever!!!
didn t everyone identify with ripley in aliens
if jlaw invented women  she should admit that dylonn  barbie pouch  mulvania and grant  him into a sorority   sikes! were her failed prototypes
Im a guy  Im a big fan  and respect the chick from alien  and the samus aran.....both have ridley in it....so...it was meant to be.  this jeneffer love-hueit lopez jezzibel lawrence is crazy  out of her mind.
before hunger games  no one has ever made a woman the lead in an action film  alien  kill bill  underworld  the fifth element  charlie s angels  tomb raider  la femme nikita  terminator  and many many more. how could someone be in hollywood without knowing hollywood s past
Ive forgotten about hunger games. lawrence wouldn t be on my mind when it comes to female action stars.
ok without u even putting ur video out  when I heard this the first thing I thought of was wait... laura croft and wonder woman..... these ppl are mind blowing
I dont even think of the hunger games as an action movie more of a suspense genre.  evidently j lo has never seen any horror movies as well where the female lead is a trademark  or any of the fantasy movies where there are a lot of female leads.  just reaffirms thatshe lives in a bubble and doesnt know shit about past film history not exactly a usc film major is she.  even going farther back to katherine hepburn and vivian liegh.  no princess leia  sarah conner  ripley  red sonja  rita in edge of tomorrow  anne lewis in robocop.
how some other action star women such as  jaclyn smith  farrah fawcett kate jackson of classic charlie s angel s.  cameron diaz  drew barrymore  lucy liu  charlie s angel s 2000. sigourney weaver of the alien franchise  and ghost busters  linda hamiltan of the terminator franchise  milla jovovich of resident evil franchise and joan of ark  ingrid bergman  a swedish actress from way back who also played joan of ark  angelina jolee in tomb raider  demmee moore in g.i.jane  carrie fisher in star wars  gal gadet who plays the modern day wonder woman  lynda carter in the 1970 s wonder woman  uma therman in kill bill  lindsay wagner who starred in the 1976 show bionic woman  michelle ryan in 2007 bionic woman. so no ms. lawrence  your not the first.
you know what she s first at though  being the first hollywood starlet who got all of their holes inside and out caught in 4k and spread all over the internet
it would have been epic if sigourney weaver just tweeted her   hello   . I would have loved that.
uma thurman got every guy on the planet swinging samuraI swords!
the only thing bigger and more glorious than her ego is holy gigan.
it is absolutely insane viola davis nods along with it not even realizing jen just sh t on all females and even black female action leads from 5 decades ago with pam grier.   does davis not even understand her own side of thatstory  lmfao
nah  sigourney is on the woke train right along with her.
@seraphswitness  oh  thatsucks. it could have been so funny!
14 seconds in and I had to hit the like button!
and now you understand why a growing number of men are choosing sex dolls over real women. I know if I had a choice to date jennifer lawrence  or any hollywoke actress  or a sex doll  I would choose the doll.
hollywood lives in its own little bubble
I no longer can play the walking dead games  because I cant feel for clementine because she s a girl  and Im a dude. so she s no longer s tier  she s f now!!! on a serious note  you dont have to relate to a character in order to find them to be a great character. like nobody could relate to clementine because she s in an apocalyptic world and has to grow up at a young age in order to survive. not only that  but she also had to look out for a baby when she was 11  because she was friends with the babies mother  but she died a couple hours after giving birth . kratos kills Gods out of revenge  and then travels somewhere different to get a restart.... relatable right! !  some of the best characters out there you cant relate to  but that doesnt stop them from being great and heartfelt. only being able to like characters that you can relate to  only shows the lack of compassion in ones own character  and a haughty spirit. but relatable characters can be good as well.
being from louisville we are pretty proud of jennifer lawrence but  this wasn t one of her better moments.
wow  Im 19 days older than the world s first woman. I guess the egg did come before the chicken
so to her credit  jlaw was great in both silver linings playbook and american hustle. but in that one interview  she made me never want to rewatch hunger games  ever  and I am so glad she did not get the role of carol danvers captain marvelle.
not gonna lie it reminds me that take of that female dwarf in the rings of power   first female dwarf to ever appear on screen   and it clearly wasnt.
mel is not only smarter then lawrence  she is better looking too.
you dont watch movies to  identify with  the lead  necessarily. you watch it for the story. but I suppose if youre completely obsessed with gender identity then you watch it to hope to see yourself on the screen.  but then  maybe if they made movies with stories that compelled and entertained  then you wouldn t have the only thing in them be to have each person watching maybe identify with the lead s  and why you now have to have every single possible gender and race represented and shoved at the audience like they re trying to force down cod liver oil.its also telling that these folks always feel they have to announce their lofted role  even if it doesnt exist and mostly when it does not.  I was the first  there were none before me and now Im so proud  stunning  and brave this just reminds me of the saying that a real king never has to tell you they are.  this is why they have to constantly signal how important they were  since they really never were very important. youre an actor  or actress or athlete  you get paid to do what children do for free in and after school.
cutthroat island 1995 and long kiss goodnight 1996 geena davis two of my favourite movies. does that mean Im not a man.
modern actors live in a bobble in a cave like hermits   probably dont dress themselves or speak without a team of consultants   managers tells them what to do. old actors at least had a bit or street cred from their early lives to relate to. also the old actors usually made sure to take the  pretend to be nice   thank everyone -course that at least made them seem neutral polite. these modern  im a victim  mumbling about being opressed as if we where in the dark middel ages. then again maybe jennifer is hearing voices like joan of arc  that would explain her bravery.
okay okay  funs over... some one is gonna have to tell her. what do we do  draw straws  rock paper scissors lizard spock
just like the men do if the woman took roles that are actually well written they will get the praise
why could only women identify with both men and women  that makes zero sense. as a man  I in fact did identify with lara croft  being a loner and interested in exploration and history . that was way before I had even heard of jennifer lawrence by the way. what s funny is that when the tomb raider 2013 reboot came out I actually thought  okay  now lara has a bow  thank you hunger games
we were told... .  who told her this !  lol.   are there some people like that  both men and women   sure.  but I assume I am not alone in being able to identify with a very wide variety of characters regardless of sex  color  shape etc.   maybe thats just more common with is sci-fI and fantasy fans lol
all hail jlaw  first woman ever  Goddess of all women on earth. amen... uh... awomen.
that thumbnail though
the ultimate female action lead for me was sarah conner in t2.  strong  damaged  ruthless  violent  and 100  devoted to protecting her son.  fuck humanity.  its her son she s trying to protect.  the rest of humanity should just be thankful that they ll be saved in the process.
this is at least very slightly better than when the same bullshit came up with black panther  as this does at least appear to have been the first time anyone had put this specific woman in the lead of an action movie.
its why talk shows just aren t interesting anymore. most actors have nothing to say  just inanities. look at talk shows and interviews from the 60 s and 70 s  actors had personalities and could hold an intelligent conversation. now all they can do is promote there latest project and spout nonsense like jennifer.
drew barrymore  in firestarter.  thanks jennifer!  p
I dont understand her comment about being able to identify with characters. Imight like or dislike characters but gender  ethnicity or looks has nothing to do with it. and I hardly ever identify with a character.I also cant understand what she is trying to say when backtracking on her claim. in a statement to thr  jennifer clarified that her remark  came out wrong  and what she actually meant was how  good it feels  to be a feminine force in a male-dominated genre  cited from the daily mail.the academy award winner said   thats certainly not what Imeant to say at all. I know that I am not the only woman who has ever led an action film. she continued   what Imeant to emphasize was how good it feels. and Imeant that with viola  davis    to blow past these old myths that you hear about   about the chatter that you would hear around that kind of thing. the 32-year-old concluded   but it was my blunder and it came out wrong. I had nerves talking to a living legend. jennifer s blunder occurred in a sit-down with fellow oscar winner viola davis as part of variety s actors on actors series.
ah wait   she wants to be the new chuck norris ....
the patriarchy has covered this up  but before hunger games women weren t even allowed in movies at all  making jennifer lawrence the first woman ever to appear on screen. if you dont believe this then you think brittany grinier isn t the most important athlete in the history of sports.
wow  jennifer has not done much movie watching if she thinks there were no female action leads prior to hunger games. how egocentric can one be ! Im just going to throw one obvious but by no means the first  resident evil  2002. milla would like a word  or a fist to the face with her  Im sure.
kate beckinsale underworld she played vampires versus werewolves she was the female lead 1 2 and 4
I feel like she was regurgitating some agenda driven factoids someone else fed to her to promote their erroneous point of view in some sad form of belief perseverance or cognitive bias.
x-men first class  c mon youre forgetting her stuff too
jlaw s supporters are still trying to gaslight what she said through semantics. she was flat out wrong. period.
I was never terribly impressed by her acting and thought she was hugely miscast in hunger games. not because of her acting per se  but because her pie face and apple cheeks did nothing to convince me thatshe was an emaciated scavenger. it would be a minor nitpick except everything else in the story  her character and motivation  the worldbuilding  everything hinges on selling the idea of a dystopian world where the outer districts are kept starving and impoverished.if they couldn t find an actress with cheekbones  couldn t they at least have tried to use makeup to make her look a little bit gaunt  cgI even
whoever wrote jennifer lawrence s script for this interview really should have done some research first.
if Im being honest I dont look up to any woman. women do not have the attributes that I aspire for so why would I look up to them  however  I do admire great and inspiring women. women can still teach me things. but I know from first hand experience being raised by a  strong independent woman  that boys should not look up to women. boys should care for and respect their mothers  but no boy should aspire to be like their mom. my mom has all the attitude and more than most feminist and she doesnt even believe in that feminist crap. but all that tough girl bravado thatshe had couldn t hide the fact thatshe was overly emotional and continually made bad choices at my expense.
she was al gore s muse  prompting him to invent the internet because of her.
thats the difference  mel  you are a woman. lawrence is an adult pretender child. she also misses her  close relationship  with weinstein.
love all you johnny come latelys chiming in on such nonsense. this goes to show you people are not aware of how much this is going on as plenty of actresses have been chiming in with similar claims  even actresses from top gun maverick. the  anti-sjw  darling ana de armas also spewed such things about women not being given lead roles.
the thing she was best at was being  friends  with harvey wienstien.
Imight be wrong  I think miss pac-man was the first lady to helm her own video game. lol!  the og had nice gams too!
weird way to find out I have the same birthday as the first female action movie lead
the sarcasm is strong with this one...
mike even reacted to this
adam regrets losing a rib seeing it produce jennifer lawrence.
ms. lawrence could say she invented the internet  that worked great for mr. gore.
damn  jennifer lawrence invented women  I say give that woman the nobel prize for architecture  just dont tell sigourney weaver  linda hamilton  kate beckinsale  mila jovovich  angelina jolie  jamie lee curtis  lucy lawless  sarah michelle gellar  uma thurman . .  jennifer  try not to dislocate your shoulder trying to pat yourself on the back.
I guess she never heard of catwoman.
the funiest butter babe on the internet!
wanna know something crazy  a recent video interview with sigourney weaver  and she praised jennifer lawrence for her  standing up.  jl basically just dumped on actresses like sw! so what the heck kind of stunt is this
you gots ta clone yourself and put em in a movie to relate to that character
variety should know better.  interviewer could ve clarified she s the first teenage focused female action lead in some time.  but they let it run  then threw her under the bus by publishing it.pretty wild kind of pr grab.
nobody wants women in movies ...
I thought gary and wyatt invented woman in weird science
Ive actually never met a woman before until I saw jennifer lawrence. I thought they were a mith.
so ripley  sarah connor  and selene never happened  please. I am a man and I am a big fan of all three ladies. if I had a daughter I would have her watch those three ladies as role models.
gI jane  geena davis action movie  I think it bombed though   alien  tomb raider  jolie   charlize theron  mentioning her because she s the greatest
and sifu s wife  simu  invented asians. without shawn chI we never would have seen one.

I heard that   jennifer lawrence is close to being blackballed out of hollywood. maybe her statement is proof of that
this is not very reasonable imho. she really is saying odd things...3 13 I dont know many people and less women than men to go  its good I wasn t drinking water  and pfft!! and lol.and you did it again. that was really fun!
before I was born  the world didn t even exist.
wise men speak because they have something to say  fools speak because they have to say something   plato.
these people just want hand out. they always go on and on about how there are not enough women in this  in that  then why dont they build one. build up the place that you want it to be  why do they keep demanding us to do it for them
but maybe they weren t women... Im just assuming because they were assigned women at birth... what a bigot I am.
we named our daughter ripley because she is a badass and one of my my favorite characters...and Im a straight white guy.
she is also the first to have photos leaked online...
has she never heard of lynda carter  Imean I know her wonder woman was a tv show but... really
Im pretty sure that melonie is the first female youtuber ever
little known fact  she also starred in the Bible!
she can backtrack all she wants  but my video is already up  too!
she s the first person to use ax  by   m in real life
Im the first human that breats  its like I invented breating
she stated  we were told..  meaning she isnt or hasnt been thinking for herself and she may not know much about her own industry....
lara croft  wonder woman  black widow  etc. and Im only going into the past 15 or so years.
instant regret in her part !  she needs a star in a reboot of clueless -  the reality series
she cant be serious!  right!  she cant be
Ive heard she was thr first person to ever get registered on video.
south park has become reality.
jennifer lawrence invented the nike swoosh.
in 1916 helen holmes was the first female action-movie hero.
I dont think she s lying   I think she s really believing in this bs   I dont know if it makes it any better - in fact I think it makes it even more worse - but at least it doesnt make her a lier
jennifer lawrence invented you  God bless her!
didn t they invent movies for her
sigourney weaver alien  alien 2  linda hamilton  terminator  terminator 2  fern gully samantha mathis. samus aran  metroid metroidvania spinoffs. demImoore in gI jane prior to the slap heard  round the world. michelle pfeiffer as catwoman in batman returns. lots of great female roles from movies  gaming  animation. before  during  and after her limelight premier. just a checker flag toss up to remember the name.
so that explains how  while more vg than movie  but icons like samus  chun-lI  tifa and others got to be. its all thanks to jennifer lawrence  lol.
clarice starling  megan turner  sarah connor  ellen ripley  salt  red sonja  lara croft  underworld  cam aaaaan!!
like her role in hunger games... but Lordy she took the role too serious after getting stung by a jabberwocky.
I guess they didn t know about alien or terminator or gI jane in kentucky. she s from kentucky
I think there s 8 alien movies   and if Im not mistaken  just 1 of them didn t have a woman lead.
I guess chlo  grace in kickass never happened.
this is nothing new. hollywood celebrities have always been off mentally and saying stupid things. the only thing thats different now is that we have social media and we hear of it right away.
didn t angelina jolee play tomb raider in like 2001  or was that j law traveling back in time and I just got them confused.
let s just forget thatsupergirl made it to the big screen 18 years before spider-man.
I swear she said this to get attention. there s no way she s that oblivious and ignorant
im a man and terminator and sarah conner was my favourite films and action heroin ever in my childhood but I guess those times took place in another universe to jennifer lawrence
I never watched hunger game. I only know her as the actress who botched mystique. she didn t even bother studying the source material.
I guess sarah conner from the terminator series doesnt exist huh
didn t black widow come out just last year
I guess sigourney weaver linda hamilton milla jovovich uma thurman angelina jolie charlize theron sandra bullock michelle yeoh and scarlett johansson aren t action stars to jennifer lawrence!
she was recently in dont look up with dicaprio. I think she is still relevant. what she needs is to revert the brain wash.
1990  first woman born.me  born 1988
jennifer lawrence is a time traveller.  fuck  who knew!
sigourney weaver   ripley from alien   was bad ass  in that movie I guess she wasn t born before jennifer lawrence   haha . kate beckinsale in underworld   lynda carter in wonder woman   milla jovovich in fifth element  lucy liu in kill bill even uma thurman   kristanna loken in terminator 3   sarah michelle gellar in buffy  1997  ... all of these were better than jennifer lawrence  and before she even was in a action movie .I liked jennifer lawrence  but after her talk in this interview  she has lost respect  she s so woke .
so she is the one to break the glass ceiling in hollywood in the 2000 s wow  thats sarcasm
so this invention may initially look easy on the eyes but it makes too much noise.would also like it if jennifer released a slimmer version with a manual snooze button.
her daddy got her the part.
dont forget sarah conor back in terminator
I knew segourney weaver never existed!
I love melanie mac. she s basically thequartering but hot
honestly Im most offended thatshe thinks hunger games is an action movie...
these people do not get tired making fun of themselves do they. you can only be naive and ignorant up to a point  but with these people nah  the sky is the limit.
Imay be wrong but wasn t it also her when passengers came out decrying how little women in hollywood were paid despite being the films biggest earning star by quite a good margin
6 50 - most important part
she waa in touch when she was in kentucky and winters bone. she has been out of touch since passenger s.
I doubt seriously if that was an original thought with her. she was most likely parroting what someone else told her while simping to flatter her.
ayyyy I caught that jjk reference
she s never watched a movie before clearly.
sigourney weaver and linda hamilton have just stolen the concept of being cool women from lawrence. she s such an innovator.
I dont know how she thought this or who told her this or maybe she s never seen another action heroin in the last I dont know 40 decades
have y all heard the good news  jennifer lawrence invented the y chromosome
delusional  barbarella  1968 jane fonda   aliens series  sigourney w.   haywire  gina c.   tomb raider series  angelina j.   aeon flux  charlize t.   underworld series  kate b.   kill bill  uma t. ... just to name a few lead female action stars off the top of my head.
if she did she messed up badly
there were silent era perils of pauline and there was another   iis the harrows of hanna or  some thing like that
time travel is real!
I have heard a rumor jl also invented boobs so men who aren t into behinds can enjoy something.
I think the interviewer is just as equal to blame for this fail. why did she not say something
pam grier was a black female action star lead back in the early 70s!!
according to nerdrotic she is only 100ish years off
she is mother earth after all...
jennifer lawrence is chuck norris  mom!
lol dude cindy f ing crawford was the lead in an action movie hahaha
maybe she means 1st female action hero that did 0  of her own stunts
kill bill was cool  classic
kate beckinsale in underworld one of my old time fav female lead action movie.among many other amazing female lead actors. way before jennifer lawrence.
lol jennifer is probably a flat earther and thinks you fall off the edge.
honestly she s jumped the shark so much already  her best bet is to keep jumping. take it to abject absurdity.
tv series the bionic woman 76-78 and wonder woman 75-79  I guess lindsay wagner and lynda carter were men according to jennifer lawrence since she was the first female lead.  what the hell is going on here
this is new  hollywood which started 2012.
she actually believes that  alternate reality bubble at its finest.  and hunger games is an action movie
alien trilogy  red sonja  tomb raider jolie movie  nikita  charlie s angels  kill bill....
anyone mention cynthia rothrock. kung fu queen hotness.
that movie was called  monster
melonie mac taking no prisoners
let s go back to 1951   a little know film called  the african queen   jlaw doesnt hold a candle to katherine hepburn as an actor and that film has quite a bit of action  for the time .
3 52 thats her job and she s not hot enough to be bad at it
hunger games didn t have that much action in it
I thought jl was much older!
jennifer lawrence was the general in charge of d-day. thank you  jennifer  for freeing europe!
I wonder if she was on the goofy grass when she came up with this.I heard she partakes.
cynthia rothrock exists.
ellen ripley is twice the man that jennifer lawrence is
in france our aritocracy was in this kind of delusion in 1789 .
you were the best one she made  boomstress.
red sonja  terminator 2  she  sheena  ffs!
glass ceilings just came down all at once.
sarah connor and ripley we re never a thing  now please turn your attention towards this pen light!
there was no women in lead of action movie shocked face of milla jovovich  kate backinsale  angelina jolie etc.
the fact that a veteran actress of action mocked her by using history and math. beauty truly is stupid when arrogance is applied with make up
jennifer lawrence invented women.simo liu invented asians.what a time to be alive!
jennifer really hunger games is one of my fave franchises but you just sound like the usual hollywood person
do westerns count as action movies  because I canthink of a couple off the top of my head  annie oakley  barbara stanwyck   hannie caulder  raquel welch
u know I get jlaw  shes as u said born in 1990  missed alien  aliens etc and probably was too young to watch I dont know catwoman or charlies angels or even xena and dark angel  no wait that is 2002  12year old  weird  she should know better then  at least this  or tombraider with jolie  man  I dont know  anyway  maybe she lived under a rock through her childhood or locked in a basement  probably cant say for sure  but saying this outright so convinced its true  is like  I dont know what is like  but its a bit bold and stupid.but viola davis is older then even me and older to know better and again  unless she lived under a rock or locked somewhere with no connection to the outside world she mustve heard at least about some movies like terminator 2  or well alien s  or alien 3 or 4 etc  or bunch of other movies  if not seen them  then kinda take notice at some point and whos the lead character etc.all im saying u can kinda lets say forget the stupidity of jlaw but davis  no way  she right then mustve known its full of crap what j saying. but she just nodded and agreed vocally so I think both should be under pressure  not just jlaw. but anyway j was the one who said the stupid thing so the main attention is aimed towards her  so gl getting rid of this  might stay with as long as chuck norris memes did.
when she talked to adam sandler and described her fans as annoying when they came up to her I stop caring about her.
summer glau
if we count musicals  betty hutton also played annie oakley and doris day played calamity jane  and did so much stunt work thatshe suffered massive burnout after filming . and frankly  I think doris day was far more of a badass than lawrence could ever be.
@reid mason  yeah  I stopped at musicals... although Im aware of the duplicate stories
may be she was actually the first to start the  go woke  go broke  movement.
Im sorry but who tf has talked about the hunger game movies  I literally forgot about them the year they came out
jennifer lawrence  a woman made up of many parts. unfortunately  one of those parts is a mind with a very selective memory.
if what jennifer is saying is true then Im captain james t. kirk
I dont understand  she s a damn actress  she perfectly knows there are hundreds of action movies with female leads  who is trying to convince  everyone knows that.
also buffy was a big thing
believe all women !
I guess fuck tank girl  aeon flux  ultraviolet  resident evil then.. also  she wants to compare her pay to rdj  the man who kicked off and led one of the most successful movie franchises to date  pretty funny  given she was handed a significant marvel role and tapped out before the end of the second movie and phoned it in after that.
she said she is worried about coming off as not intelligent because she quitschool at middle school   paraphrasing .  jennifer    look for the orange     above the npc  and turn in  quest complete.
it is a silly thing to say. I get that there is more to the whole interview  sure but.. wow. someone didn t do their homework. and you dont have to see every movie that exists but eeeh  ! it helps to have seen the classics.
we all knew jenlaw was an idiot but till lately Imistakenly thought davis was at least not brain dead but new movie and this interview have awoken me .
wow! she s literally the first female lead in an action movie. my question though was hunger games really all that loaded with action . more of a love storyshe destroyed her legacy with this interview. but probably making a public woke statement like this. so she ll get scooped up in the next hollywood pile of trash. these celebes that go on drought always do this.
ripley and sarah conner were strong badass woman but also the films explored their motherhood with sarah and john and nute and ripley they were soft when they needed to be  but woman today in films have to be fully strong and if they show weakness its canceleled
and dont forget sydney poitiers in from sir with love in the 60s. like wtf!!!
so I guess coffy never happened.
the only thing jlaw was  first  of was 2014 s fappening celebrity iphone nudie leaks going public  dshe certainly cut that ribbon there.
oh ya.  I forgot about  how jennifer lawrence invented women.
how d viola davis keep a straight face though
she has to be joking  right
I dont have to identify with the lead character to enjoy the movie...its called plot...
hey cute melonie  so jennifer the first strong and independent  heroe right  ok lets  meke her happy or we just telling her the truth.
let s see -- does it take more than 3mins to think of 10 older movies with female leads ...double jeopardy  1999  ashley juddgia  1998  angelina joliemighty joe young  1998  charlize therontrue lies  1994  jamie lee curtisred sonja  1985  brigitte nielsenterminator  1984  linda hamiltonoverboard  1987  goldie hawnalien  1979  sigourney weaverstar wars  1977  carrie fishercleopatra  1963  elizabeth taylor
does this mean we now have a definition for  woman
agreed  she is embarrassing to women. the fact thatshe was the highest paid female actress in the world at one time  and has such a limited knowledge of film is very sad. also  ofcourse its boys fault for her false claim. smh
I posted a pic from the suffragette movement with the caption  jennifer lawrence campaigning to get women the vote.
so what we re saying now is the definition of a woman is jennifer lawrence harvey weinstein is would be so proud
yeah we allllllllll know it isn t true... but will anyone call her out on it to her face
gI jane  replacement killers was the interviewer laughing at her !
ultraviolet  2006    aeon flux  2005
then what was sigourney weaver and why not have such a crush on  her
yes. but al gore invented jennifer lawrence.
hollywood has been dwarfed by jlaws ego.
her trying to step back into  the light has really brought back some perspective. she clearly has not been relevant since hunger games that has mostly to do with her acting skills.. they are simply middle of the road at best. and that makes you wonder.. was harvey weinstein speaking truthfully when he said he fucked her. Im starting to think so cause her movies following hunger games are forgettable.
what about the tomb raider movies with angelina jolie  not the best movies  but she s a female lead in an action movie xd
uma thurman in kill bill  I had her poster on my wall..she was absolutely badass  and I totally understood her charachter  these blanket false statements designed to just create animosity and resentment are just getting ridiculous..I really whish actors would just shut up now
shout out to barbara stanwyck.
lydia carter  as wonder women 1972
stunning  if she s your type  yes. brave  to go against reality   common sense on camera  yes. inspirational  for woke feminists  yes. Im glad you didn t mention  intelligent  because I d have to say no to that.
wasn t she planning to retire about now  I was sure I saw headlines about it a year ago. why pull this stunt if you want to make a graceful exit also  I canthink of three angels who would like a word with ms. lawrence
lol  the title of this video
I thought j-law was down to earth. wtf happened
the interviewer s smile kind of says  youre an idiot  but she says nothing. is this deliberate to let jennifer look dumb or is she just bad at her job.
melonie mac go boom!!!
shout out to michelle yeoh !!!
mizzzzz lawrence invented the electric car by insisting that her female electric magnetism is all that was needed
I proudly invented misogyny.
jl looks like the hottest girl in every 200 population midwestern cow town
lara croft  beatrix kiddo  lightning from final fantasy xiiI  samus from metroid  chun lI street fighter 2  ellen ripley alien  samantha cain long kiss goodnight.
someone should show her intervew to kate beckinsale  milla jovovich  uma thurman and sigourney weaver. Im sure they will appreaciate being marginalized by women who claim to support female empowernment.
hunger games wasn t even the first female lead acting blockbuster that year. underworld awakening came out in january  hunger games came out in march.
does she actually believe what she s saying
cocaine s a hell of a drug.
dumb and dumber and tropic thunder were supposed to be comedies  not documentaries.
wasn t that chick in the exocist kicking ass out of those 2 priests and the whole catholic church until that one priest threw everything he had at her
the sad part is I really liked her  she seemed not cray cray. guess she s just as broken and an attention who.e as the rest of them. shame.
she s just mad thatshe isn t the top female actress anymore  she isn t getting roles like she used to and she isn t the talk in hollyweird  she s mad her buddy harvey isn t in power anymore
jeniferzoolanderlawrence
I am so glad jennifer finally got around to inventing women. was a real sausage fest here before she did the necessary work.
jennifer lawrence invented women  if true  that would explain a great many things.
and viola davis just sits there nodding along  whasupwitdat
pam grier may be upset.
my thanks button isn t working. any one else having this issue
you dont have a pobox for fan gifts
kill bill 1 2  cant touch it j-law
that happes when you drink all of the coolaid  d
I really wish viola davis would go away ...if that woman slips on a banana peel she ll whine about vitamin c
on top of all that bs she s spewing her only role was in a movie which was a blatant remake of a japanese movie battle royale.
geena davis  the long kiss goodnight.
melanie mac
Im pretty sure viola davis was the first black woman in an action movie when the woman king was released. glass ceilings!
mythical mysogyny
she doesnt watch movies. she s clueless about her industry
so ripley  sigourney weaver  or sarah connor  linda hamilton  or lara croft  angelina jolie  dont count
women put her there..the women who were infatuated with her now what
jl really needs a break from delusional world and come back to reality!
I saw something on this earlier today and Ive lost a lot of respect for jennifer lawrence.
I feel like she was probably taking the piss with this. people are so easily triggered now.
also you should do a give away at 100k subs
wow jennifer lawrence is trippin    she ain t even all that...
thanks to harvey weinstein. she forgot to mention that.
well I guess aliens and tomb raiders among many more dont count lol   well thank God for the day she was born lmfao
I say stop picking on jennifer  God knows what she had to do to get the roles in her life  and God knows what drugs she s been taking just to wash the stink off  this interview is an obvious cry for help
I guess sarah connor and ripley we re both men
lets see women in action rolls when I was a kid in the early 70 s. wonder woman - isis female Goddess  foxy brown aka pam grier charlies angels  I can go on for hours.
jl   boys cannot identfy with a female lead of course  boys always hated ripley  sarah connor  xena  lara croft  jill valentine  claire redfield  bayonetta.
when you give these a-hle media platform  what do you expect
I can debunk her statement easily. hally berry  catwoman action   milla jovovich  resident evil series action  survivor  horror   anjelina jolie  tomb raider series action  adventure   etc........
this is why I never really listen to actors. they are not living in my world.
linda carter wears jlaw pajamas
at least she can define what a women is noe
1982 mrs. pac-man
they have good crack in hollywood  you cant really blame her
Im the first caucasian man that ever picked his nose. see  I can play that game too.
cough  ellen ripley  cough
no female action stars  damn  I didn t know jennifer lawrence could perform time traveling gender reassignment surgery.  I hope she at least gave sigourney weaver a massive set of steel balls in trade for making her the male lead of the aliens franchise.
Im just shocked she didn t say she was the first white woman to have a black friend as well.
women.....in my movie! !
im glad she did that now more ppl kno how deluded hollywoke people are eventho it may not help much since the ppl are mentally closed to this shit just still
wow  the original wahman.astonishing.
you stop being able to identify with a movie lead from the moment we push in your face that this lead in question is male or female. as much as some people would want it  we are not gender fluid  and heroism  courage  determination  human qualities have no gender. but when a boy see a movie who explain to him that the female lead is super strong and super courgeous because she s a women and that it makes her better than the men around her  of course he cannot identify.did anybody see alien   we all thrilled for replay  we she the movie was not telling me that replay is better than the male in the movie thats why she stay alive longer. if it was that  I would have certainly said fuck that and watch predator  yeah.bah anyway  hollywood is affected by a cancer of the mind right now and I just hope that it die by itself with low income so that we can go back to a healthier perspective
so helen slater as supergirl in 1984  and barbarella in 1968 werent women  what about red sonya  xena  and many others
kate beckinsale should thanks jennifer lawrance  because without her  she would never been able to be action star with those underworld movies.
is it possible jlaw is telling the truth because she is secretly a shape shifter who starred as all the women in all the movies
am I the only one who thinks j la is being ironic
o was going to say aliens but someone said itso  ok wonder woman ...bionic woman  terminator  supergirl the original movie.
femme fatale was another action female movie.
alice resident evil  selene underworld
charlize theron movie was monster.
hope 2 c u live on twitch soon
Im pretty sure she s just saying this cause she never seen other movies. like no one in the world sees every movie that came out there just no point into it just like reading every book. no point cause people need to exercise or do other hobbes. but I one word on this. alien and aliens movies.
maybe she said that because she s desperate for her career now that harvey is out. not saying its the right move. not saying its a smart move. but desperate people do the craziest shit.
joan of arc 1948 played by ingrid bergman. free on youtube. maybe jennifer should watch it. she might learn something about religious tolerance and acting.
long kiss goodnight  tomb raider  alien  to name only a handful
lol she shot at other kids with arrows and cgI  meanwhile sigourney weaver  the queen  was slaying aliens with real fx  11 years before she was even a thought in her parents mind. there are plenty of female lead action stars. rdj commands the room when he walks in. she doesnt even compare.
she s not the sharpest knife in the drawer
speaking of women - melonie mac is a fine specimen of one.
somewhere femshep is not approving this message.or kassandra in ac odyssey.or samus aran.or...
what about demImoore  g.i. jane    ........oh no will smith is going to biatch slap me
under world  alien  kill bill  red sonja  buffy  terminator  resident evil  lara croft  le fem nakita   all female led
melonie love the tears but she is losing her mind if jennifer thinks she was the first women tomb raider aliens sharon stone Im glad you love underworld Im waiting for the next one to come out is jennifer turning into a mary sue or what happen in the xmen is going to her head now
are those movies even considered action movies  aren t they more dystopian sci-fI drama
definitely not the first lol  nor the best. really sad if she actually believes that
dragon slayer !
underworld awakening  resident retribution  snow white and hunstman was released in 2012 same year the first hunger games. jennifer sounded stupid without a script.
I never ever idneitify with any leads ever. I dunno what that even means. blame it on my alexithymia I guess. I just was be taken out of my world watching stuff. I guess I identify best with the joker.  oooh edgeLord.... okay whatevs.
ok God... shame... I really liked her
if she doesnt want to sound like a middle school dropout  then she shouldn t talk at all.
jennifer lawrence is now eve that does not need adam. if so she s thw first woman to eat the apple of sin. lol
alien  resident evil  salt  atomic blonde  terminator  carrie  cujo  tomb raider  indian jones  she was a lead also   electra  should I keep going  lol   destroyed! halloween for crying out loud.
alien. enough said.
ripley and sarah connor baddest chicks ever
she mentions the hunger game movies like they were such a big deal they weren t even that good I was so distort I think I used that word right and then when she was in the x-men movies she was terrible
best youtube title ever
good vid siski
not a movie but buffy
sarah connor is from the future so she doesnt count
you video didn t pop up on my subscription  I saw itsomewhere else 8 hours later
passengers was good.
buffy the vampire slayer started off as a movie.
@thatnoobnextdoor  good point  forgot about that.tanks.
who s jennifer lawrence
let me hit that melanie
in 2012  jennifer lawrence invented women. in 2016  bernie sanders came out and said what we are all thinking. his wise words were  the american people are tired of women!
hehe-he she invented women.
I thought we are not supposed to be able to know what a woman is
I dont understand most people anymore.
boom!!!
anne parillaud  nikita 1990.
its hollywood is anyone really surprised...
yeah jennifer lawrence got original movie thatshe starred in in 2012 which is a ripoff of battle royale a japanese movie literally identical plot so battle royal is way better than the hunger games
no men can identify with a female lead  my ass. just thatstatement alone  good God. I know she s referring to someone saying that to her  but how far removed do you need to be to tell someone that. prime example  me. I was very sick as a kid  and my mom was overprotective in addition. so I spent my early years trapped inside. little mermaid was one of my favorite movies because  yeah  dude  I wanted to be where the God damn people were!
she genuinely believes the propaganda
alien and aliensfatal beauty  1987  whoopI goldberg  I guess they did have black women back then!
she is right. kill bill does not exist. aliens does not exist. neither does colombiana  haywire  underworld  resident evil  wanted  death proof  etc. jennifer really is the first one xd
cynthia rothrock
barbarella...... tomb raider...... resident evil.... supergirl.....
who is she
jennifer lawrence is drunk or something. sigourney weaver never existed huh....figment of our imagination I guess
she should apologise to the real icons of film. she constantly puts out this idiocracy
cynthia rothrock aka lady dragon.
woo ow   heelvsbabyface
shes like the rest of them  that was fame do to ya.
wow
these are power plays for matriarchies  and segregationists  and revenge for people in the me2 and blm movements is the big difference.  jennifer lawrence was trying to retcon her shit into these movements  is the real undertone and take away from this interview.
this has to be the dumbest statement made by any actor let alone by jennifer lawrence. and then you got viola davis over here just going  uh huh  in total agreement with her dumb statement. just sad lol.
jlaw was the first to morb
is this anything new brie larson said basically the same thing thatshe was the first strong female role model its just two lady not thinking   kind of full of themselves
she is the first woman to be woman
I was so waiting for you to destroy her
j-low needs to define what a woman is first.
I understand your logic. all those  women  who were leads in action movies over the 5-6 decades weren t actually women  so therefore she is obviously the first woman to be an action star.....what  what do you mean some of those actresses had children
jennifer clownence wishes she was like kate beckinsale.
kill bill  terminator  alien  xena  buffy  underworld. maybe you could say  the harry potter movies do count. mulan. the mulan movie from 2009 had a small budget  below 7 million dollar. they made over 300 million dollar. nearly as much as the first twilight movie. twilight was 2008 - 2012. it was everywhere. most successful movie at the time  with strong  female lead. all the vampire stuff was around that time. 2008 - 2012. and it was huge. hysteric teenage girls everywhere. so  how is it possible to not know movies or shows like that  she is 32. she should know them. I am from germany  born 1995 and know all of them. impossible to not know any movie with a strong female lead. so she has to be ignorant to not count this women as strong  female characters. true narcissist. and being rich  32 years old  you cant blame the drop out of middle school for that. if its about education  she had enough time and money for teachers. but it isn t even about that. she should have had far more time to warch all of that. she is actress. the problem here is her being ignorant  not her lack of education
alians  alians vs predator  tomb raider  house of the flying daggers
marry meeeeeeee!!!!!!
will smith spanked chris rock on the face  jennifer lawrence spanked all the previous female action movie stars before her!!!
silence of the lambs  1991  anyone
red sonja
huh
spicy take
jennifer is a bot
quiet  melonie  you only exist because of jennifer  Im weinstein s pal  lawrence.  lara croft only exist because jennifer  Im ditzy and let harvey groped me  lawrence licensed women  when ps1 graphics were invented.
I hate how jennifer is getting all the blame for this. Imean come on... she is a woman so she only knows what men tell her. so this is really the fault of all men.  hint  dont take this literally
put these two bubble heads in a conversation what could possibly go wrong
this is the same chick thatsaid that donald trump was responsible for hurricanes. I think we cantake it with a grain of salt.
wooow  no wonder she has not done something relevant in a long time.
wait a min. I get it now. she is trying to re-invent herself cause to be pretty and attractive is outlawed in h.wood. so she is laying down revisionist groundwork to claim that anything before her role was a  thirst trap .  yeah ok. I see you.
j-law filmed parts of hg near me. I used to think it was cool georgia was becoming the  hollywood  of the south  now not so much.
the delusion is overwhelming
so the books got it wrong this whole time. its adam and jennifer  not adam and eve.
remember when jennifer lawerence killed bill  she did the five finger feminist fist technique!
before God created eve from the rib of adam  adam was made from the rib of jennifer lawrence.
but they still cant define what a woman is except the governor of n.y. she figured it out
shed make a good supergirl
move over sarah connor
annihilation
train go boom
drugs
celebrities  and I am not saying women  should be seen not heard I swear
welcome to 2022
she needs to go back to middle school
shame shame shame
uyh well  the avergers ........emma peele as very acton action
nobody want s women in movies  and here I am still hoping for neill blomkamp s alien 5 to see ripley again
yeah total lack of respect for the ones who came before....
guess lynda carter was secretly a man when she played wonder woman in the 70s. who knew.

these people are so arrogant.totaly spies was a 3 female lead cartoon in europe and north africa. and boys along side girls loved that cartoon.
really  little sister I didn t know human beings were  invented .
I dont like melonie mac because Im not melonie mac.
isn t some kind of a joke
never seeing her movies again. that list is getting lengthy for the actresses and actors I wont see in any movie again.
everybody needs to stop blaming jennifer lawrence for what she said its not her fault that harvey weinstein casting couched her brains out!
she also gave birth to Jesus
pans labrynth
this is the first sarcastic comment on youtube. youre welcome.
pam grier  foxy brown 1974
because no other woman ever existed anywhere before jennifer lawrence made a fool of herself. I am sorry but linda hamilton in terminator was like....my first ever girl crush. those muscles!!! angelina as lara   how about uma thurman in kill bill   no      I hate this storyline that you have to totally relate to a character to like them....behave! but  if 1990.....I was born in 1985....does that make me not a woman    oh no!!!!!!
where you keep pausing it looked like they were smelling shit air.
its like the crappier their product gets  the more insufferable hollywood becomes. I ll put up with a staggering amount of obnoxiousness if youre gonna make platoon or shawshank redemption  but if youre giving me dont worry darling and some amy shumer vehicle pos  Im not inclined to tolerate much.
I never knew she took the rip of man and create woman  jennifer Christ
if women were so great  how come there wasn t a women 2
actually  brie larson was the first woman and she ll be suing jlaw for this false assertion.
a man does not need to identify with a female action lead to enjoy a film led by one.
typical hollywood ditz... its hilarious how many people are quick to open their mouth nowadays when they didn t do the full research on the topic or information they re discussing... like the amount of virtue signaling that came out her mouth was literally making me cringe so bad I had to fast forward through the rest...
if out of touch had a face it d be jennifer lawrence. to be honest I was never a fan of hers as an actress this doesnt help.
metroid proves her wrong
the only good thing thatshe did was hunger games  and hunger games  published 2008  movie 2012  was plagiarized from battle royale  published 1999  movie 2000 . even in thatshe was not the first.
alien! hello
inspired by jennifer lawrence....first!  Im first posting a comment here! woohoo! eat it ya bunch of first deniers! me me me me me... starts spinning in a circle on the floor like homer simpson
viola davis is just sitting there agreeing with all that crap  jennifer lyinrence is saiyng  im not a fan of any of them
she s the worst smh. Im not just being a hater. she was great in american hustle  great movie! great writing  acting  etc definitely worth finding time to watch . however  her social takes are vomit inducing. but we d all be lost without her so thank you Goddess jlaw.
jennifer needs to watch some movies. she clearly does not watch any old movies. the first female lead action hero was done over 100 years ago  helen holmes  in 1915   just to be clear. also note jennifer lawrence never finished school. she has no concept of reality outside her narrow world view and bubble. itshows and viola davis doesnt say a single thing  how did variety not go wait girl hold up....
people still watch terminator movies  alien movies  and films like the long kiss goodnight and only a few die hard fans still watch or discuss the hunger games. because it wasn t very good and the lead actress was not very charismatic or interesting she was just playing a character pushed into being a figurehead  and used politically like when jennifer lawrence shilled for harvey.
anyone forget resident evil
this is what happens in a feminist brain  jlaw sees herself as groundbreaking  when she s been cliche at best.
the sexism is rife... I loved the alien movies  run lola run  kill bill  underworld... but I guess thats toxic in some roundabout way.
so who the hell was that  leading woman  in the all the underworld movies ..........now let me think..........oh yeah yeah yeah  kate beckinsale!!! ok so who gonna tell her  hahahahaha! and another ha.
yep we have regressed in these times jennifer lawrence you have been nothing but a disappointment

no  no  no.  frankenstein created woman.  peter cushing.
what has hollywood done to the mockingjay  she was good in   dont look up   but this is too much. granted pretty girls have life on easy mode. that was just cringe.
the hell is up with this excessive need to claim you were first
I know everybody is getting on jennifer lawrence she s 32 years old born in 1990 she still should have saw a lot of these movies thatshe claimed never existed before her with the actress sigourney weaver a little hamilton gina davis just way more than that thatshe never saw but she probably did but she had knowledge herself as the only one  what kills me is you got a woman here thatshe s talking to the viola davis who s in her 50s that literally saw a lot of these movies that jennifer lawrence just did not acknowledge at all and agreeing with her on this woke bullshit
God damn wamen gettin  in my akshun movees. grrrr how will I ever relate  lol I guess the 80 s never existed...
sadly I have
look at the comments on you r peach video
rip  ripley.  sigourney weaver did it better!
but  what is a woman  how does she know  she s  even a woman
didn t the 60 year old woman thatshes talking to make a pro slavery  movie
its because no one gets called out on their bs anymore.  you can say any ridiculous thing as long as you throw in some lefty talking points and no one will point out your nonsense for fear of being labeled a nazi.
why should we identify with fictional characters talk to real people  watch documentaries if you want to identify with someone.
maby the first girl en a kids action film bluuu dont care jennifer aint no woman in 2012.
jlaw and charlize theron...I realize Im probably alone but I wouldn t even kiss either one on the mouth lol. they re both just gross.
and all these female lead male bashing movies are also not make money ...wonder why
what is a woman
1996 the long kiss goodnight geena davis
cause the alien franchise never existed.
whoah  did dhe just diss the power puff girls series  that catwoman movie  that geena davis pirate movie  star crash and faster pussycat kill kill  this kid has no sesnse of history!
not sure who s more cringe between her and brie larson. didn t the latter claim she was the first female super hero casted  Im pretty sure she did lol.
even woke people cannot woke right
okay.. soo I seem to be in the minority because I never liked lawrence..neither her  personality   abrasive and arrogant  nor her acting chops which felt extremely wooden to me..somehow everybody else likes her.Im glad reality finally caught up with my first impression.
alien anybody
jennifer lawrence certainly reaffirmed the dumb blonde trope. sorry to all the smart blondes out there.
never a women leads   non of us never watched mary poppins or the wizard of oz then.
I am calling bs on boys men can not identify with a female lead.of course there are things that it would be impossible for me to identify with  when it comes to female characters. but there are still aspects of a female character in movies and tv show I can identify with.Imean if a character who is a woman  struggle to find a job or something like that  I can identify with that as a man.you can identify with anybody no matter race or gender. but yes of course its easier for me to identify with a man  but that does not mean its impossible for me to identify with a woman.but who knows  maybe I am just strange. also I apologize for my awful spelling and grammar.
female lead action movies have been a thing since the 70 s. she hasent revolutionized a damn thing. men went to go see her movie  so did i. among many other female lead movies before her s. underworld  alein  terminator . these actresses live in delusion  or its just become   the thing  to say u were the first woman in a   insert genre  peace of entertainment. they tried to say the same thing with captain marvel. im sick of hearing.   oh this was the first female lead film!  men never accept female lead actors!  women have been on the big screen in various  lead roles for more than 40 years now.
I always thought women were a hoax. glad to be wrong.
I cannot watch this  liked  commented  out
I dont get this need to  identify  with a character I dont  identify  with tony stark in any form shape or size  but I still like iron man same with many other characters I like.I like j from men in black  I also dont  identify  with a former cop from america who encounters aliens. this  identify  term is stupidly overused.
shes been the worst part of every film she has ever been a part of.
we need more melone s and less jennifer s
delusional
jennifer lawrence makes polarizing statements in order to stay relevant.she s a harvey-girl and hasn t gotten any good offers since hunger games. she married a jew and threw a bastard. now she wants to get back into the game. thats it
how about 1954 the cattle queen of montana  plenty of movies have had women action leads. how about thelma and louise  sorry  dim bulb actors should just keep playing other people and shut their pie hole.
sigourney weaver
what a joke. there s an endless list.
is jennifer lawrence an sjw
women are intellectual property of jennifer lawrence  gay people are ellen degeneres  and trans people are optimus prime s
it is rumoured that jennifer lawrence s acting could cure cancer.. too bad she cant act.
sorry  but thats some capital level of self-importance and denial of reality
lol  Im pretty sure it was God. its like written in the Bible and two its science!
boys cant identify with a female lead.  thanks for trying to invalidate my enthusiasm for favorite characters such as buffy summers and lara croft. sorry  not gonna work. keep your toxic opinions to yourself  ms. lawrence.
making this video with black fingernails... how dare you culturally appropriate!
salt
star wars ..ha!....alien  ...wat dat!.... terminator ....serminator!.... kill bill .... non-existent!....
so isn t her mom a woman
embarrassing its not very humble  even the tone of her voice  she s not very likeable and now even less.and cinema has been among us since we remember  and 47 years of watching from classical stuff to modern rubbish... ok not  action  movies only. drama and more  awesome lead female characters.and not only hollywood. there are many different lead female actresses! or were...
funny. I thought God invented women.
I thought she was overrated. also her mystique was mediocre
jennifer lawrence please woman!  cynthia rothrock!!!!   I liked you jennifer but your starting to piss me off lady!
first comment!
jennifer lawrence invented mankind  you guys didn t know that    like how so totally super duper bigoted of you.
why is everyone making a big deal out of this who freaking cares  btw she s rich  beautiful and famous.what are you 94k subs on yt wow
geena davis isn t a woman bridget fonda isn t a woman so many others before 2012. decades.jlaw big dumb.
hunger games sucked!
you didn t even exist till today. and the first thing you do is mock her. tsk tsk
and hunger games is a pathetic rip off of battle royale. and hg movies were garbage.
why you crying
it was a joke lol
just like the woke movement
she may be rich  beautiful and famous  but she s also behaving stupid  ignorant and arrogant. and I like some of the films she s been in. I think people are just bemused and flabbergasted at her comments  thatshe could be so unaware of the history of her industry. its hard to imagine she could have no awareness of all the other strong female leads over the last 50 or 60 years. I feel for her  Im sure we ve all said dumb things at one time or another  but we dont have all the world laughing at us. Im sending love and goodwill to her.
was a joke lol
@melonie mac go boom  you mean youre grifting.remember when you lied about hating survivor  rise of the tomb raider and shadow of the tomb raider
