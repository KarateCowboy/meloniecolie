the dumbest thing ever is coming out and saying what a characters sexual orientation is in a game where that bit of information isn t even needed.
fans   fix their broken game where hackers run ramped and hold people hostage dbd devs   no I dont think I will player count dropsdbd devs   maybe its because there s no gay characters
imagine only being able to identify or appreciate a character based solely on their sexual proclivities.
only in this day and age would you find a group of people offended by not getting murdered equally in a video game.
this company is extremely woke even before this.  not surprising.
when things get forced they never end well.
that one person saying  we won. get over it.  is being needlessly antagonistic.
honestly  my whole take on the alphabet mafia goes hand in hand with john 8 7. I will not demonize someone for a sin they struggle with as a sinner for I am also a sinner who struggles daily. however  not demonizing a person for their sin and celebrating it are 2 completely different things. I will not celebrate the abc mafia or gay characters. this also doesnt mean that I instantly dislike gay characters either lol see nolan ross from the show revenge. dude is one of my favorite characters in all of fiction.all of that aside  retroactively changing characters for woke points is always lazy and pathetic.
the fact that they made a huge announcement about a fictional character being gay says everything about the way things are in america today. no amount of groveling is ever enough for those people.
its like that kid in high school who forgot to check off a requirement for an essay   oh  and also  gay guy. thank you for playing our game. good Lord.
hImelonie.  Ive spent way too many hours playing this game but I dont know if Im going to play it anymore.  they also have the gay charm in the game that never expires while every other charm does.
what makes this funny for me is that  unless you ve seen the twitter post where they confirmed it  you ll never actually know david was actually gayvid all along. they stuck the in-game confirmation in a side menu within a side menu. even funnier is you have to complete challenges to unlock more of the story where its confirmed.surely with all the effort they went through to confirm david s sexual orientation  they could have just made a new character.
when these companies virtue-signal  just walk away.
imagine making a game where you did not have to introduce such a character for woke points but the actual story revolved around them oh wait that would take actual effort
I am a parent and also a gran father to my 23 year old daughter and five-year-old grandson. I raised my daughter with old school traits and values the same way I was raised minus all the negative things that happened to me growing up with my stepfather which was abuse. Im proud to say that I raised a good child who grew up to be a good person who s also a good mom to my grandson and is doing a beautiful job! I only had one child and decided I only wanted one kid due to the fact that it does take a lot of responsibility and energy out of your life the good thing is we had her when I was young so the good thing about that is you have the energy to be able to maintain and keep up with the young ones!
its insane because their game has the most diverse cast of killers and survivors with amazing backstories.there s literally no need to shoehorn this
the best update ever to the game! it added so much more content and made the game so much better. xd
chucky s on the sidelines going   I got set aside for this  also  melonie  are you aunt boom now
hello melonie congrats for you your family getting a nephew.I seen 1 ofyour cats decided to walk in while you had started doing your video.thankyou for bringing these topics out I wanted wish you to have relaxing weekend takecare melonie
sounds like he got dumbledored.
@kugrox  iirc  they already did.  a bunch of websites were running the story that killers were tunnelling the black characters in the game. this woulda been a year or longer ago though
honestly
lol I said the same thing! the hacking issue is never going to be addressed because... well it would require behavior to do some actual work. fun fact  both the report and block functions are useless as well. they only look at reports submitted via their website and the block function only blocks that person from contacting you  you ll still match with them.
cant tell you how many people I saw on twitter saying  Im a david main now  or  I love him even more now . why  because he s gay ! thats the dumbest shit Ive ever heard. this game has gone to shit fast in the 6 years Ive been playing.
when you center your personality  worldview and general behavior about something that involves sex  thats is mostly what s gonna be occupying most of your headspace. Im not at all surprised
... youre talking about all the straight people who throw fits whenever a character is introduced as gay or bI  right  .......... riiiight...
@icewolvz  it could include that  but the vast majority of straight players do not really care if a character happens to be gay bI lesbian  only that they are intriguing and well-written. it is usually  the community  or sjws that push identity politics which results in tokenism. rather than sexuality being a background feature of the character it is the defining trait for  acceptability.
being gay doesnt mean someone is in  sexual proclivity . anyone can be celibate. assuming every gay person is sexual is a bit odd.
but... but... they got mad when the gay couple got killed in halloween movie  wasn t it
so canthey die be killed in games movies or not
@hikarI no yumi  freedo!! there is no doing right by these ppl.
@hikarI no yumi  lmaoo not the joke y all really are dense
@hikarI no yumi  in this day and age no. but for halloween kills I dont why people got mad about that. micheal myers kills whoever  it doesnt matter who they are
sir  this is a wendy s.
@lilmovieperp  no  its a commentary channel where religion is discussed  if you have a problem  leave
those ugly charms are in almost every match Im in  love politics in my videogames
hImelonie. so proud of you. I just saw that crystal dynamics was acquired. look forward to hearing your beautiful voice about it.
the goal of a horror game is to get your character to survive not explore their sexuality. jason or michael in the other room do not care about what parts of the human anatomy you like. they will dismember you equally.
there s already a gay character. you cant even try to tell me that trickster is straight
hahahahaha the cat is the best. itsteals the show being all cool and cute! your channel keeps getting better and better.
congratulations with the birth of your nephew! they grow up so fast.
Jesus always has a smart reply ready for the pharisees.
its the best when youread the long Bible verses!  keep up the good Lord s work  melonie!
im here to stay. you cannot tell me what I cannot gay.
tbh I really dont care if the character I play in dbd is gay because Im running from a killer that tries too kill me but I really hate that they took an existing character and changed it.
I  3 this channel so much mel!!!
to be fair the dwight-david kissing in the locker artwork exists for a while  so maybe they wanted to give fans what they wanted..  but yeah  lazy af  dbd is known for making lazy choices xd
uh...they do realize dbd is a survival horror game  where you have to escape the killer before he kills you all  right why is  diversity   inclusion  and  representation  so important to these people  instead of great storytelling and or characterization
I feel kinda bad about this  but  sexual immortality  is really funny to me.
dead by daylight  we have a pretty diverse character selection.peter dinklage  hold my beer!stevie wonder  where s my beer!stephen hawking    slurp   beep! boop! beep!
isn t dead by daylight a horror survival party game  like there s no story  why should we care about  representation  if theres no story. this is literally brownie points like apex and overwatch
will they penalize the person playing the killer in dead by daylight for  ending  the gay character  claiming it to be a  hate crime  by trying to  end  all of the other characters equally
goes back to the same thing  they could always start a new game with these woke characters  but no. the left cant leave us alone until we all think act talk like they do.
this was dead to me when it took out the leather face stuff now I  know Imade the right call.
they only chose king  because his perks are the most demanded meta perks in the game  making him popular. this is literally solider 76 from overwatch all over again.
are they that desperate  did sbmm kill off their playerbase that much
loonies man  loonies
I do not even remember the character in question without searching him up. out of all the characters  his is the most forgettable. being a homosexual does not make him any less so. I like the killer through. she is fairly cool and has her own theme.
because representation is ontologically good unless done wrong
better question is  why do think representation and a good story are mutually exclusive
@evan ellis  because it is.they choose to pair with lackluster story.
@john heusler jr   this media is bad because it has representation  is no better than saying  this media is good because it has representation  this is also different from saying  this medias representation is good
dont say beep bop beep you ll get cancelled like they tried with gina lol
yep exactly like they did with the claudette leatherface issue. leatherface could earn meg jake claudette dwight faces but they took them away because some drama farmers  without evidence  claimed racists were targeting them with the claudette mask. no proof or corroboration but boom bhvr took them from us  achievements weren t easy to get either . this will no doubt be a repeat of that because their skin is so thin.
probably
they will also go after anyone not choosing to use that character.
@kyle bardwell  yup  and thats exactly the reason this game is on the decline.
that would be my only reason for playing!
lol good one
thats because we re correct and you aren t
pretty much yeah
what is the 2 for  also yes  its all for woke points.
it is uncanny how relevant this is in the mordern day with so many people virtue signaling like crazy and cancel culture canceling each other
it really seems like a cop-out for virtue signaling point. why not just create an original gay character
I will defunetly not be paying for this game
who want s to go back to the 1930 s with me   stay forever
anyone ever see those older videos of melonie from about 12 years ago  long before she went carnivore  she seems so much stronger and more vibrant now. she s like steve rogers after he got injected with the super soldier serum
thats an interesting shirt! cant believe dead by daylight would do this....
david king  more like david queen  amirite
I got fiddy bucks saying killers are gonna focus kill all gay david king characters from the get go! serious talk though  people watch and play horror games for the kills  not for their sexuality.
melonie! the topic is literally the definition of late and gay!!!!
from what Ive read the problem is not that they added a gay character. the problem is that a key feature of one of the killer was altered to codify said character once they killed them.am I wrong
its entirely possible that the character was already written as gay and  you know  it was just never brought up because it was an incidental part of the character. then  someone somewhere in marketing noticed this and said   why didn t we use this to pander!   and now here we are. its these sorts of opportunists and profiteers who are chiefly responsible for preventing characters from simply being gay  or whatever  without any fanfare or signaling or whatever else. as long as there is money to be made by pandering to partisan politics  vultures are always going to pick a side and pander to itso they can soak up whatever they can from our dying  culture .
ok  wheres my Christian character
the idea that this is worthy of announcement is hilariously tone deaf and silly lol
this is about pandering towards a group of ppl that barely even cares. Im glad ppl are making it known more and more that the virtual signaling is exhausting
genuine questions. in a game where your purpose is to openly kill people or play as a potential victim do they really think this will go over well with how immature some gamers are
Ive been waiting for the xenomorph to finally get into the game since release  instead they re pushing for woke stuff
rainbow bright was quite a dark show at times.
ok back when I played dbd and this character was revealed a good portion of them community was making trans jokes saying she looked liked a transgender deathslinger  a old man killer with the same length of hair  and the devs where shutting down threads and banning people. at first I thought they where offended now itseems that they where mad people figured out their dumbass  twist  from the get go
ladies and gentlemen dont forget that mother s day is this upcoming may  its may 8thdo with this information as you wish
does your profile pic mean anti-lgbtq
@lead   paprika  absolutely
I would like to go to the an even further ago time where people lived on farms and all they thought about was survival  not  hmm  should I change my gender.  lol. people who whine about their sexuality need to be slapped. there are more pressing problems in life to worry about.
I would prefer 1830s myself
@somebody87  sounds good.
do it for the lolz. watch twitter throw yet another hissy fit
youre basically right
thats the least problematic part of tokenism tho
handsome jack lol
the 2 is for people that express all numbers in base 2 exclusively. its ironic because the symbol 2 doesnt exist in their universe.
and this is why I support indie developers like farm 51 ww3 and other military shooters .
yo!!!! is that a rainbow brite tank top!!! that is awesome took me back to the past 80 s cartoons!!!
what s the significance of the  2  in lgbtqia2   I was confused last month when I learned they added the  ia   part  but I looked it up. I cant keep up anymore  next month they re gonna start adding in like     or something. I know a fair few gay   trans people and they re all cool  legit people. completely different than these weirdo unhinged internet folk or those activists you see at universities and stuff.news flash  not every single intellectual property needs to become rainbow rangers. there is a place for diversity   inclusion  I dont have a problem with that. but stop doing it just for the sake of doing it or hijacking things and  reimagining  them. itshouldn t be about checking boxes. tell a compelling narrative  create new ips  etc. at this point its almost to the level of the old  token black guy  from back in the day.also  anyone else remember the burger king kids club
they j.k. rowling ed it
Imean  if they wanna  gay representation  so badly  the best way would be to add undead jeffrey dahmer as the new killer. he does extra damage on male characters.
yes heaven forbid they give us an original cool gay character! Im 100  against changing any character in any medium because youre damn right mel it is low effort and insulting! they dont give a crap  they just want those sweet woke points. also on another note what the heck is the acronym  what the heck is 2   sorry for all the questions
the leatherface  issue  also is ridiculous
people are so creatively bankrupt they can only make existing characters into whatever they need in order to score some points. they are unable to create something new
over on reddit there is a good portion of players that called it lazy as well
you d be even more insulted if you knew more about dbd. they come out with new characters every few months. some are licensed  so they cant change the lore there  but there have been eleven original characters to release since david  and another is right around the corner with the anniversary patch. why not call any of them gay  why even talk about the sexuality of pixels in the first place  Im pretty sure there are no lore lines about any of the other characters  sexualities. but  gay  so gotta pander.
create an idea for 1 gay and lesbian chr and give them some duggestive qualities to them. we dont need an expressly gay lesbian chr. if it is suggestible thatsaid chrs are like this  then for one to interpret them as such gives an equilibrium on both same sex and not same sex s side.give gamers least of all  the platform to determine for themselves who or is not x. even if its an uneven split  the gamers can decide for them selves and so everyone gets what they want  its really thatsimple.give the people this and you eill make your money  while providing the people the what they want!
it would have been cool if they added lafayette! now that was one badass gay character.
as an almost since release dbd player  yeah  they suck hahahaha. this was just too much.  yeah  our players need to know what our characters fck in a  killer-survivor game! but obviously!
dont act like people will be less mad if it was a new character lol
why not make one of the killers gay  seems to me this is just going to lead to people specifically hunting down that character in the game to troll.
are you going to come out with a lgbtq character pack  no. we are going to treat our characters like military surplus and slap and  like new  stamp on it. also anything after the q doesnt matter since q is an umbrella term for basically anything other than straight or lgbt.
just make it feel natural. is that too much to ask we dont need a neon sparkling sign constantly above the character s head saying their orientation.
goes to show that they suck as compelling writers that they must add gay characters and make their entire existence as a character to only be gay  while placing any characteristics or personality  if they are even written with a personality  as either second to being gay  or nonexistent.   sorry for run on sentence  the best correction for such a situation is to write the character first  then make the character  happen to be gay    because gay people are people first  before being gay.
lol how long will this acronym get
I just call them the alphabet gang
@araujo jhonatan  facts. Im using that from now on.
@nemesis the slasher   good question point. I d probably be like  yeah  nah  we got this. we dont need your help. um  can you please stop  youre making us all look bad.  but thats just me looking in from the outside.I could ask a few people actually. one of my best friends has a sibling that transitioned about a decade ago. as the older brother  he was a miserable basement dwelling asshole that hated everyone  as the older sister  she s as pleasant as can be. another friend has a younger brother that recently got married to a much cooler dude than he is. my friend s brother is like the most stereotypical effeminate gay guy in pop culture. he d probably err on the side of the internet freaks but I think his husband is on the rational side of things from what I gather.I dont think I d feel comfortable asking the various former coworkers or other people Ive met about this stuff though  but you ve definitely piqued my curiosity about what their perspective is on this stuff.
thats how the modern entertainment complex is. putting politics into media has ruined art. not sure how we can come back from this irreversible  damage to art
@timothy g.  saying a character is gay is not political.
true honestly
the more letters numbers they add  the less serious I take the lgbtq2 eieio.
I find it funny that people call themselves  queer  but complain if they are called  strange . literally the same thing. if I was a homosexual or whatever  I would not call myself  queer  or whatever and pretend Im apart of some community. I d practically be the same as I am now. you get people who seem to act a certain way because of their sexuality and itseems silly.
glad I haven t touched the game in a year   sad I bought 2 dlcs. its not a horror game anymore  for what little horror there was   its a platform for their political stuff wrapped around a broken game they refuse to fix but will continue pumping out dlcs.the sooner it dies out the better. justiceforleatherface
when we  as humanity  realize that doesnt matter that which race  gender  religion  sexual preferences people belong to and treat everyone really equally we will level up and enter the next phase of our kind. itshouldn t matter who you are. we should come together in bigger scale and find the things that unify us  not divide. we should seek emotional similarities  not physical. we should come together in feelings. I should feel sad  happy  angry or proud for the people characters when I see them in a story scene or reality. you cant just tell me that  hey! this is a muslim super hero girl and she yeah she s muslim  here you go and enjoy your muslim content.  it is a discrimination in my eyes. if I dont know her motives  her attidute toward others  that if she has a good heart or not why would I care  I really dont care what her religion is. I only need to know thatshe is a good person or not. thatshould be the only line thatseperate us. there are only two kinds of people. good or bad. there is not even a remote need of representation in every place. as a muslim  I dont need to see a look alike in single every work of western media. I have the basic notion of empathy. I can relate to anyone and their stories. this is what makes us human. I personally choose to follow western media and I like the way it was. luke is my fucking hero. I fucking love batfleck. superman is my idol. I love hideo kojima to death  ik he s japanese but he makes great western style games  nolan is a God in my eyes. I love the og blade  ripley  bilbo baggins  django  pam  jim  oscar and stanley. the only similarities for me that they all have good hearts. it turned it into something soulless  a meaningless race. this pointless agenda of attention seekers shouldn t even be a major topic.
1 20 they should rearrange the letters so it can be pronounced  lib2gaq .
so... if you happen to kill that player first are you homophobic
hehe you should have a video with gothix
they pulled a soldier 76. 1. take the most badass  manly character in the game. 2. say he s gay.3. profit from idiots.
unfortunately many believe that messiah abolished the torah. but as we know the laws he was referring to was the traditions that were cooked up when they were in babylon
they pulled a soldier 76.
the developers are trash anyway  dbd is extremely unbalanced and they do a terrible job of maintaining their older dlc content. not to mention it has the most toxic playerbase Ive ever seen lol
love the hair
there s numbers now Im a member of the lgbtqna community  and I have trouble with all the things they keep adding  hell even the way I write the letters is a in joke to myself as the qna double for queer nonbinary ace  and questions and answersat any rate  I dont really see any reason for a horror game about monsters chasing people to murder needs to declare any of their characters as lgbtqna  as I when I play a game I just pick a character that resembles me a bit and pretend their trans  I dont need them to tell me a character is trans nor do I ask for them to make a trans character  just make a game thats fun to play
what s the point in just putting the label  gay  on something randomly when its not even relevant. if Im gonna make a story and Imade two guys and in the middle of writing decide I want romance them Im just gonna do it like I would do it with straight characters. if Imake a guy and girl character and in the middle of writing want to put them together I dont sit around thinking about how big of a deal Im gonna make out that these characters are straight  Im probably not even gonna mention it. so why should I if they were gay. I dont even see it as relevant to point out their sexual orientation because maybe later on I ll want to put the  straight  guy with a guy or the  gay  guy with a girl if the previous relationship ended in the story. I dont mind if they say made this david king character gay cause they made this other guy character later on and just thought they were cute together but that doesnt seem to be what s happening.
cause running around in a circle needs to be gay.
since the gay community wont call bhvr out for this lazy virtue signal  I guess its a good call on their part since there s no downside. I think all groups that want representation should be more cautious about celebrating insincere actions like this because the praise is unearned.
whenever I hear that alphabet soup I just want to claw my eyes out and bite out my own carotid artery honestly queer or lgbt is all you will ever get out of me anymore letters and I cant take them seriously.
as part of the lgbtq  community  is it insulting  nah. not at all. could it have been done better  yeah  sure  but media people gonna do what they do and try to make a big deal out of it.Im at least happy its david and not someone more stereotypically considered to have gay traits.  but was it necessary to know anyone s sexuality in a game like this  nah  not really.
two spirit is a religious thing. Im religious so I can appreciate that. however  they ve tipped their hand  belief in more than two genders is a religious belief. they can have their religious beliefs. but forcing them on others and the pronouns that come with is unacceptable bigotry
itseems reductive to that entire community. they are being tokenized as a community.
so with the change to the character being gay  is it now an issue if that character gets killed first  am I a phobe of some sort because the person behind that character sucks at playing  I dont care about character sexuality at all  as long as its not hamfisting it  see paranorman as a fantastic example of doing a gay character  however making a multiplayer only game having canonically  gay characters now just poses the problem of harassment enforcement even when there was no harassment.
they cant even fix issues we ve been begging for fixes to since there was only like 4 killers... of course they d shoe horn more woke trash into the game.. its effortless  .
agreed  as someone who started playing this game in january 2017 and recently coming back to the game because of a mate who wanted to  stopped playing what feels like a bit before 2020   this game really started going downhill after bhvr bought off starbreeze. as you said  they push their political agenda  push dlcs like there s no tomorrow without addressing any real issues in the game.too bad that I haven t been able to fill the void of this game with something else  there was nothing like the old dead by daylight in my opinion.
when will people accept that things wont die if we feed them  us talking about it is giving them money as consumers are the product not the creation. thats politics for ya
@timothy g.  isn t that just the unfortunate truth.
politics hath ruined humanity. its a game of who s the bigger victim  on both sides
I get people throw that term around but no.. clearly not lol
there s a difference because they actually made a great story and did so experiencing his both manly and sexuality showing his toxic masculinity caused him to suffer
yeah its not good period
they shoot themselves in the foot when they make the killable character gay. they give the character the label for no reason other than to make money and make a shallow non story based character that just needs to die the end lol so shallow
its called marketing. its obviously directly going to create revenue. not sure how people still dont understand this. like the female ghost busters and other woke remakes  controversy creates monetary value objectively whether we like it or not. even just complaining about token characters does the same result. I dont like how it works but we as consumers are the product  not the project. its not about art anymore. its about political discourse good or bad. the only way to abolish this is by ignoring it
lmao this is actually one of the best representation it just shows you haven t read the tome or anything and just assume literally a lot of gay people like it because itshows amazing writing of queer people
@okp  o  there s a lot of examples of a genuine effort regarding representation in gaming  mass effect allows for your character to have gay relationships with full voice acting and support for that relationship across the 3 games. borderlands has multiple gay characters  missions  and even a dlc that has you save a gay wedding from an evil creature. wonderlands has pronouns in your character creation as well  for example.david has been out since 2017 and his sexuality was never addressed. the other survivors haven t had their sexuality addressed either. dbd isn t like those other games Imentioned so the best thing they could do was make a new character instead of adding lore to a five year old character. but why should bhvr give you steak when a happy meal pleases you
@anthony mcmillan  other survivors have had tho felix has a wife david used to have gf which if youread the story was because it was a cover up. ace commenting on girls and so pm
not sure how you conflate the two in any capacity nor how you let it ruin a food for you but thats just sad that youre thatsensitive.. but agreed its too many letters I just say lgbt or gay and call it a day
maybe its different in your country. but in usa we are free to do what we want. you aren t forced to use pronouns in most countries from my knowledge. its more common curtosy but not necessary. but otherwise agreed man
people love to claim they re helping when they re really hurting a minority. I dont get it either
youre thinking too much please dont worry!
lesbian here  its not that deep.
natural diversity is good  not forced diversity. hopefully elon is going to cause a domino effect and it can be ok to be straight and white without being labeled as everything in the book
while I actually agree on token gay characters being problematic  your comment section is growing some homophobic rhetoric as well as radicalization. Im not on either political side but as a Christian seeing this amount of vitriol and hate is just really disgusting. I like your videos but some comments are objectively hateful and disrespectful
people should really be wondering what the     includes.
Im gay but this is cringe  as itseems crowbarred in to just say  look we included a gay person  out of fear of being called uninclusive and being cancelled  or to score woke points  because when would his sexuality - gay or straight - become a topic during gameplay .. there are no romantic storylines in that game. Im sure representation has helped things in the past but people aren t going to know his or even a new character s preference via playing so it reads as pandering  which is cringey. Im not insulted they didn t make a new gay character  I dont think they needed to do that or this as 1  characters  sexuality doesnt have to be announced unless the devs wanted it to via some organic reason and if its actually relevant  and 2  this topic doesnt really fit into that type of game  within that gameplay. they might have had 100  pure intentions for all I know and I dont mean to sound hateful.. but its like kellogs announcing tony the tiger is gay.. what does that do  how would that information even be relevant within his purpose  aka crowbarred
thank God they didn t make jeff gay. he s actually my favorite character. not that I play it anymore
I feel left out! not a single character in any movie  game or tv-show are said to be heterosexual. just because they are together with someone from the opposite sex  that doesnt mean they are heterosexual. they can be confused  bI or just not having the time to know themselves yet. cant we ask companies to go through every character through all history and define them as heterosexual or what sexuality they have  so we no longer can go back and clarify something   fyI  Im just taking a piss at the situation. I dont really care at all.  please continue with verse of the day. even as an agnostic I feel some kind of calm when listening to verses from different religion. if youremove the religious perspective in them  they are very often  be a good person  and happiness will come . isn t thatsomething we all  regardless of belief can stand behind and put or faith in  also thank you for introducing me to the carnivore diet. Im not all in yet  but have increased the amount of meat and fat I eat at the same time as Ive removed pasta from my diet completely.
as a proud trans  woman. iam happy for representation and submit to em my woke points
unless who you sleep with is going to help you get off those damn hooks  who the hell cares
itstands for crazy!!!!!
I wonder if we immediately lose if we kill the gay characters. kinda like how the twitter mob tried to cancel michael myers for killing a gay couple in his recent movie.
the whole representation thing is a joke but especially is heavily lazy when they up and change a character detail etc instead of introducing a new character but no  just to make it notice online for some woke crumbs pathetic  lazy and pathetic.
oh no its overwatch gay-ification all over again.
deleted the game now
so glad I quit dbd when I did devs are a joke
ngl this is taking things a little far in my opinion. not everything needs to be inclusive like this Im an african american male and I dont feel left out just because there s no african americans in a piece of media.
could have at least made it a hot female couple.
sorry for being off topic but  I was going to say that I didn t know you were a fan of rainbow brite.
ohh...I thought some of the campers were already gay. my bad
its not hurting anyone. be mad  stay mad.
their plan 1  introduce gay character2  wait for someone to kill mock ... character3  reeeeeeee
its because God has a plan for you to know him. accept him! he loves you and he knows you are open so give him an inch he will move your life a mile! agnostic means you are open to being wrong  so why not figure out why the Bible speaks to your heart  just a thought! Jesus healing power waits for you God bless you
@timothy g.  this is not an attempt to be negative against anyones belief. maybe agnostic is the wrong way to explain my religious faith. I believe there is a bigger plain of existence than humans  and the world we see around us. I also believe that the human race is not intelligent enough to understand  to explain it  to identify it. I also believe as a human race we will never be able to explain it. we dont have the vocabulary to explain it  so terms like God  heaven  hell. all those are wrong. therfor  all religion that has existed  and all religion that will exist in the future or all religion that exists today are doomed to be wrong. this higher plain of existence. for you that might be God. for you the human race can describe it  can understand it. I do wanna add one more thing. the meaning of life is finding your own meaning. to live to be a better human. if you fulfill that with believing in God  praying  reading the Bible. who am I to judge  do what works for you and that is what is most important.
Im glad youre happy but you shouldn t be supporting bad media. its only going to make them lazy. Im a film student and the media needs to change soon. its too political.
boom
your plan1. make up a fake scenario about people that dont exist2. realize that the fake scenario is stupid3. blame other people for thatscenario being stupid
@rizzy  what  my plan is to ignore them.
@awnage  then why make up a fake scenario then post it in a comment section
wasn t freddy krueger already gay
and there is the next aaa video game failure. hope they enjoy going broke.
of course because they cant make good characters. if they made someone new  that character would  suck  pun intended xd
I know what happened ok  you dont need to remind me
I dont understand the whole representation thing. weather or not it has some gay character you can play as or a lesbian actor in that movie  that movie or game can still be a dumb product or boring. representation doesnt guarantee a quality product weather its your people or aliens in it or cats and dogs  gay or straight and so on.
good to know  not buying any games from them.
this isn t different from comic books
hopefully the tide will be turning soon!
welcome to 2022
remember when sexuality wasn t a marketing gimmick
I find them a bit insulting. I dont really play it  so I ll move on.
why do we need to know the sexual orientation of any of the survivors  last I checked dead by daylight wasn t a romance.
yeah.  this is ridiculous.  this is something thatshould just be written in to the story and thats it.  once they are all   look at us!  look at this gay character we made.  we are so cool and hip now!   its just virtue signaling  patronizing  and stupid.
wow they turned him gay lmfaoo the one buff guy who runs without a t shirt had to be turned gay what a huge leap into pandering smh. I used to play hard-core dbd with my niece and nephews haven t played in some time smh these people cannot do things without having to recon a character. why not just create a new character like they always do so lazy
one of the reasons aaa western industry is all but on life support being mostly bug ridden and broken at launch constantly with generic gameplay and lazy uninspired stories. they care more about diversity points and microtransactions than making actual good games  -
let s be real 99.9  of companies or games whatever it is they dont care about this stuff they dont put work into any of it its all a hook line and sinker. youre damned if you do youre damned if you dont. all of its ridiculous
women peak time for child birthing is late 20 to mid 30s
what
lol what  everyone knows dwight is gay. why they keeping him in the closet  or locker rather. big fan of dbd  still play it  still have fun. but it was always dwight  dbd community all agrees.
every year I get further and further from this game. Ive been playing since 2016 and all I keep seeing from them is more and more pandering and not fixing their game. yeah  change a character to be gay instead of fixing your shit. could ve atleast put effort into it and made a new character for people to enjoy while pandering  not like a game about killing needed anything to do with sexual orientation
its specifically the 2010 reboot freddy in dbd  who s a confirmed child toucher  boys and girls   so yes  you are correct.
you dont understand  ok so its for a thing called money. the end. Im a film student and its literally called marketing lol good and bad press creates money directly. people dont want to believe this but its simply a fact. me even just agreeing with you is feeding money into this project even if im nothing in the grand scheme of things. consumers are the product. not the product itself.
you do realize when we talk about it that is why they do it  as a film student its literally a fact that controversy sells. its better to not support it then to line their pockets with millions by talking about it. so clear
I agree with thatso much man. to each their own but its not a good game in general but I get if you dont like the support issues. honestly all games are like this now unfortunately
well its not like the game wasnt without alphabet folks before Imean everyone knows leatherface is trans
I dont get  why a horror game need a gay character   what s his ability   bend over    this is just stupid
of course they made david king gay. he was the strong white brawler who appears the most masculine of the guys. their goals are always the same. destroy masculinity and femininity. I dont support this in either way.
ben playing the game 5 years I will always say fuck bhvr
so these people are claiming all native americans american indians are gay now   seems pretty biased to me.
2 is supposed to be  two spirit  taken from native american culture... though I dont quiet understand what exactly its supposed to mean... you know.. masculine trait women and feminine trait men.
does the character mince about with bent wrists  loud shirts and speak with a put on  over the top whiney voice
Im gay and I really have no idea why there would be a push to have a gay character in a game where the characters essentially exist to be lambs for the slaughter.... like what the hell did the alphabet community do  complain  thats not fair  homos should get equally slaughtered  as well!!!    ya know... in this day and age... thats probably exactly what happened...
anyways this video was such a weak argument. stan david king our gay icon and stay mad cope and all that other good stuff.
the year is 2042   we are happy to announce the first transracial  demi-pan-asexual  differently abled cyber otherkin character. we are committed to representation of the lgbtqiampqhjvrksm69420 .
dammit when I was just starting to enjoy dead by daylight dammit  oh well that frees up more room on my note 9 512gb.  sounds like just another tokenized character to me  well okay my is better spent playing other games without tokenized characters.  Im 50 my wife is 40 and we dont have kids though we have 2 cats.  wait Jesus said  are you so dull    awesome .
I dont even like this game but I am keep playing it I dont know why......this game was better in 2016and do youremember they remove leatherface s black mask because people think it was racist.......some people did use it to target black people but that wasn t necessary to remove it there is only 1 out of 10000 people who targeted black peopleI love black people I respect thembut I dont like them getting to much power
genuinely who cares  I feel like you folks get so offended over such irrelevant things lol
you would think the tokenism of lgbtq  would get annoying. and yes  I think everyone is getting tired of this. people are starting to realize how superficial virtue signaling is.
whether they make a new gay character or turned an existing character gay there will be complaints. representation needs to happen more and there should be more of it. heterosexuality is being constantly represented. in every form of media. the whole reactionary thing needs to stop. good representation is always ideal but there are people who will still complain even if that is the case.
hey melonie I just want to tell you that I am definitely with you on this topic bc I am soooo truly upset and angry bout this bc I have a cousin who is gay and I dont have no problem with having a gay cousin and so I do not know why these video game company has so much problem with having a gay character in each video games and come out and tell that they hate having a gay character in the video games. anyway I just want to say that if they have so much problems with it then they can put in an non gay character in the video games and leave it like that and move on with their lives and their business  ok melonie. anyway thats what I wanted to say bout this topic of this video  ok melonie. anyway hope you have a wonderful and great blessed evening at home with your pets and have a good night too melonie.
I really really hate this so much. I was an avid dbd players  Im obsessed with halloween so mikey being in there was awesome  but the mmr   this constantly pandering to the lgbtq - asdf crowd is just nonsensical. steamers have to put  ally  in their twitch descriptions or get ready for the salt to flow. I quit the game and I will not be coming back. this is thatslippery slope we warned about!!
as a gay dude Imust say  why the fuck are they focusing on their sexuality in this game  its a survivor game not a date or gta game
no .. putting gay characters in video games is not needed  unless your trying to expose children to that.
I dont understand how characters bedroom preference has any effect on their zombie slaying skillz.  def. just sjw trying to get internet points.
now he s david queen.

I dont understand how anything s been destroyed either way though  he s no more or less masculine than before. Im glad it was him they revealed is gay  I d have half expected someone more twinky.
@thatharvguy
ok when gay men are feminine thats bad because its stereotypical...but when a gay man is masculine thats... also bad
nothing was destroyed or changed plus david was a prime example of toxic masculinity
@okp  o  david was changed to be gay. his masculinity was destroyed. if nothing was changed then why do you use the past tense  was  in your comment  does suddenly being gay mean he is no longer toxic or did they make a toxic character gay
@evan ellis  oh  thats right. Im a  conspiracy theorist.  there most definitely isn t a pattern in practice occuring in movies  games  commercials and advertisements. its all in my head. look dude  you want to bury your head in the sand then thats your problem. because from the looks of it your misinterpretation of my original comment makes itseem that youre on meds coming into this convo.
@evan ellis  its not a problem. its just a fact.
its not our religion but we should respect it! I have native friends but Im rather ignorant so I cant say much. Im not sure what it means and I dont really care but its deeply historically documented more than any other  non binary  lifestyle so I find it rather interesting
pick me im not like the other gays I hate being represented
you didn t mention any squid legs or octopus tentacles. how very invertibraphobic of you!
bold of you to assume any of thatstuff is or ever will be real. I get its a joke but no  most things you listed are simply never going to be accepted
make up a fake scenario in your mind to antagonize the people you mindlessly hate  and of course you d find itstupid.
@rizzy  cry more
@bahamut  the only one crying here is you
@rizzy  I was mocking diversity virtue signaling by taking it to absurd lengths. you were the one that came here you complain to me about my joke. no  I am not the one crying here.
its damnit  not  dammit
yes I agree its not a good game but I dont expect anyone to care.  I dont think anyone cares that you dont like the game either. just saying
yea this is such a weird ass statement
in the film industry its very clear controversy sells. its called marketing. I totally agree with you but us talking about these topics literally lines these peoples pockets with millions. its purposeful. same with bad remakes. they aren t losing.
the issue is the creators of said characters dont give a f about you. not being rude I just think you should want something better. they ll still complain and let them   but dont you want better gay characters lol
@timothy g.  I want more representation. not always going to be good unfortunately and no one wants bad representation but its still something that needs to happen more. and even though david who s an already established character has been confirmed to be gay and its not a brand new character he himself isn t a bad person or character. so its still good representation. just not new  different or original.
@speed beyond logic  Ive heard people say  but david cant be gay he has an ex girlfriend!  but then ive heard other people respond with how a lot of the time gay people would date the opposite gender for a while before discovering their gay  so I guess thats a thing that could be represented too. its not  unrealistic  if its literally a thing that happens in real life
@evan ellis  yeah I agree.
money. thats the only reason why media even does anything it does
yes. children should be exposed to the knowledge that gay people exist too.
@lawrence newman  yes  they should. the same way they should be introduced to every other basic fact of human existance like other cultures  genders  races and religions. how is it arguable that children should grow up knowing that the things that exist  exist
there s like 1000 other arguments that hold more weight than this. I learned what gay was when I was literally a child and it wasn t because of parents  media  or school  its because they exist in society. yeah they tend to exist and you cant exactly change that. sorry bro
not all games are for kids. you think kids are playing an ma15  rated horror game  and even if they are  it aint the games fault. thats just bad parenting
a game intended for adults about killing and sacrificing the innocent to feed an entity that feasts of emotions  wont somebody please think of the children
while I agree with your comment 100   the term sjw is.... yourealize its 2022 right  ok dont mind me bro carry on
gay!  gay!  gay!  gay!  gay!
who cares   maybe they just wanted a gay character.  its not that deep  fam.
lol  the game has literally no story nothing  why does it even matter in a game like that  absolutely useless and unnecessary
such a shame. a game I dont care for says a character is gay and I still dont care. maybe if it was tqai2  since that part of the community left the l  g and b behind. nope still doesnt affect me. darn my straight Christian morality.
wtf ....oh no... they made the strongest guy character gay !  if tr gets another game they ll come for jonah next
seems pointless  I dont play games for real world representation.
oh  look. they decided to pick a white character to do this with. Im so shocked.
ah thank you. now I know what game to delete to make space on my hard drive. I do not support this bigoted sjw nonsense.
I dont get the lgbtqabc  thing why is it not just lgbt  the   is the important part there itstands for more meaning you dont need to say lgbt then a q  because the   is the q and the a and the cdfjt whatever tf you want I just dont get it  no hate but wtf ppl why the   its so fckn extra imo.
no one cares. remember when j.k. rowling came out after the harry potter books were done and made dumbledore gay ...why what did that even do pandering  dumb bsglad I stopped playing this broken game.
oh no is that a gay  Im being erased.... jk dont get mad
gross  glad I never bought this game.
they never put in the effort to represent the gay community. its the same play no matter what industry tries
I am an avid dbd player. I was one of the few on those twitter replies that were kinda  ehh  about it. yes  good to know david is gay now but couldn t we find all about it in-game ! within the lore that is  now available to be discovered on the new update. no  they had to do a twitter post about it. that annoys me and shouts  red flag virtue signaling  at me. I commented on itspecifically  and I got called out a  gay hater   homophobic . I loose all the will to speak about anything on-line  specially on twitter  if it has the sexual preference topic in it because I will feel the bad mob against me. it was awful. every community has thatside  I know  but I couldn t believe it was that harsh...
sex outside of biblical marriage is sexual immorality.isaiah 55 6seek the Lord while he may be found.call on him while he is near.john 14 6Jesus answered   I am the way and the truth and the life. no one comes to the father except through me.
art is inspired by the real world. always has been.
how is that bad
@rizzy  Ive already explained what I am talking about to the other person who replied. now for you  why are youreplying to such an old message  the truth is what it is and cannot be refuted in any capacity  so do be mad elsewhere. or as the kids say   touch grass .
gay people exist.
@rizzy  irrelevant.
npc
especially
okay merica
