all g4 had to do was to fire frosk and apologize to the fans. instead they doubled down on insulting fans all because of the message.
g4  we hate our target demographicalso g4  we tried so hard to build an audience.
part of diversity is diversity of thought! I loved this quote!
tom cruise   thank you for coming to see this film that we made for you! hollywood   you are the reason this experience is going to suck  give us money!
frosk  she hulk  rop  msheu  all are an example of why gate keeping needs to be a thing again. you want to be part of these fandoms  you earn your place by supporting and investing in what is already there  not trying to change it as soon as you walk in the door to suit your ideas.
part of diversity is diversity of thought  well said mel
frosk is hard to look at. not just cause she s repulsively unattractive but because her bitterness just oozes out her pores. personality is everything.
could it be that melonie  actman  dunkey  yellow flash  and many existing yt game commentators have fuffiled that representation role long before g4tv came to the platform
one of my favorite personalities from the old g4 was chris gore.  I have no idea what his politics are nor do I care.  the dude was enthusiastic about movies and you could tell he really loves to talk about them.  that made me want to check out stuff he was excited about.  to me that is the embodiment of what gamers care about.  someone thatshares their passion.
its sad so many people had to lose their jobs. Im sure there are so good eggs in the group. always great to see you melonie. remember you have a lot of people who have your back. take care melonie.
I think you can simultaneously feel bad for the people who didn t sink g4 and revel in the downfall and the people that caused it. especially when the head didn t even have the common decency to tell their employees they re closing shop so to speak. this whole revival seems to be an example of what not to do in business or any venture
g4tv  talk to  em frosk! tell them why we re all fired!
melonie mac in her signature camo t-shirt! we love to see it! congrats on reaching the 70k subscriber milestone! well deserved! you have been gaining subs like crazy for a month now and will continue to do so! I said this when you first created the channel and I will say it again  you will get to 100k subs by the end of the year  maybe even 10-30k more than that! a shame that ppl lost their jobs but if g4tv had fired frosk after the crap she pulled like they should have instead of agreeing with her and keeping her and telling ppl not to watch because of not liking what frosk said  even the ceo said not to watch  then they wouldn t have had to fire a bunch of employees  the ceo wouldn t have left and they wouldn t have had to shut down. of course the woke employees are doubling down by saying  right-wingers  and  incels  are to blame instead of frosk.
I do feel bad for the ones who didn t deserve to lose their jobs I dont feel for the ones attacking the audience
gamergate was just about ethics in game journalism and exposing political narratives in games we just wanted to have fun and play video games
unfortunately  they wont learn from this. they will double down even further that it was the fans fault. there is no accountability anymore.
its sad to see them go but this was doomed from day 1. frosk just brought the impending doom quicker.
the best scene was when frosk was digging for mithril and found the tesseract.
the most awful thing about this is that a lot of good people lost their jobs. I wish them the best.  3
I would be very surprised if frosk gets a job in this industry again. if a company does hire her as a public figure  they deserve what they get.
facts
gotta keep earning that rockefeller cash
na  g4 was unsustainable from the re-start get-go. they took a concept that was highly innovative in 2005  but obsolete by 2010  which is why the original g4 disappeared. now they take the same concept that has already been obsolete for 10 years at minimum and reintroduce it. it was never sustainable  too many employees  big studio  high costs  not to mention the 25-30.000 dollar day rate thatsome of the guests received. like probably conform market for them  but stupid move for a company thats already bleeding money out of their eye socket and ears. the end of the company was imminent from the start. frosk just accelerated the proces by going full bananas wildcard hate on the fans  which incidentally are also the target audience that the show expected to get their payments from.
yes
@stijnvdv2  this. 7 39
@stijnvdv2  lol you tried  g4 would ve been fine  not on cable but on youtube they would ve done just fine
once they realized that they couldn t control their viewership they ended it.it wouldn t have mattered how much they were in the red had they had that effect.I guarantee they d magically keep going regardless of their financials like cnn has been doing for years now.people need to realize that nearly every major corporation has a hand in the system of control and what makes it viable is how much we depend upon said entity.thats the truth and its time for people to wake up to that truth.this is why everything sucks and the only way it doesnt suck basically comes down to your level of acceptance to whatever nonsense they ve successfully got you to buy into.my roommate hates everything about the control and will tell you angrily how much he hates it connecting every conversation to how much he hates it yet he watches all the woke tv because being entertained is obviously more important than his outrage.its absolutely mind boggling
what audience were they trying to build  like all woke content  its for an audience that doesnt exist  because wokesters are a tiny minority  and only a tiny minority of them are interested in the types of content that gets turned woke  meanwhile alienating the existing audience. these companies know this. they are well aware of it  but they do it anyway  because they knowingly make this stuff for the people who dont like wokeness. its largely about esg scores. blackrock can destroy their stock price instantly if they go against wokeness and the climate agenda  at least if they drive away all their customers and audiences they die slower.
gezzz  itsounds so much like ghostbusters 2016...you d think they would have learned.
@red head guy  Imean  who you gonna call  ill see myself out now.
it was probably a tax write off   this cant be true that they tried .
well  they did try hard to build an audience. they just excluded 95   of the people available for moral reasons.
@mike litoris  it was very brave.
@jd  stunning  one could say.
@mike litoris  indeed
cue linkin park  in the end  clip.
@red head guy  they didn t because the last jedI  captain marvel  and rings of power exists
there s no way that was going to happen because everyone behind the scenes was just as woke as she was and saw no problem with the situation. what they needed to do was hire an attractive cast to host the shows that were just pleasant in demeanor
@stijnvdv2  yup. I really dont know how they could make that type of content work when we can now curate our own set of comedians and reviewers on youtube.
fire frosk because she said something people disliked  so engage in cancel culture
g4 wouldn t have survived anyways.  what are they going to do  show cops and cheaters   both shows are politically incorrect in our woke world.
mhm. facts.
hire sexy women  talk about games and sex and show hot women.they did the opposite.
frosk rather ruin the whole company than apologize. and that exactly what she did.as Ive heard she already ruined another brand before g4.
@alexxx8th  jup  pretty much it. the industry has changed. where g4 was innovative in 2005 coz there was nothing of the sorts  now people go online on yt to see reviews about the game they are interested in from fellow peers. people aren t interested in watching hours long talks on cosplay d d or smoking weed  or watching adam cesspool   ahum sessler talk about a game thats 5 years old.
@ron weasley  no. unless you are like extremely big in viewers  yt doesnt cover the costs of what they were spending. and they were spending massively  like really massively. also why so freak n inefficient  like I can get better material from a gaming millennial reviewing a game from his mom s basement with his 2008 camera in front of a green screen.... like you cant compete as a company with that with all the expenses  especially with all the stupid hours long of bullshit filler  talking about weed and d d cosplay with alphabet soup weirdo s as if you are still producing content for cable tv. like no  they really wouldn t have survived. w o frosk  the execution would have come a little later  but would have come none the less.
this was hellbound to fail from day one. there are way too many platforms for gaming news and culture now compared to back in 2001 - 2007. they didn t have any of the charisma or fun in the host. frosk and sessler just railgun its inevitable failure.if they actually had captivating host  a direction for the channel  learn to ignore toxic people or release a calm yet firm statement about it and stop blaming people for their failures  they could have had a decent run.
and now they have our message
@7gmeister  the whole point of tv is  programming....  us.      I think most people realize that now and we aren t down for it.
@lucky strikez  you d be surprised how many dont though and its still a taboo subject to most
got woke  went broke
not even fire if only they said this is her personal view and not of company. we welcome all.
lol no
correction to the statement   all g4 had to do was not hire frosk in the first place . frosk was openly racist and sexist during her time at riot. g4 either didn t do any sort of research into who she was or hired her specifically for that reason. they knew what they were doing. they deserve what happened
worse  they double down  then went back on their double down and had amourath in a ball pit wearing a bikini.
all they had to do was games discussions and journalism.  injecting their personal psychological problems and politics wasn t what anyone was tuning in for.
sadly  that is how so much relationships fail. too much pride.
the silly thing is this all started because frosk was shockingly unknowledgeable about gaming  she thought bioware was owned by microsoft and mass effect was still an exclusive...  and got called out on it. this all could have been prevented by simply looking at frosk s past since she s done it before  and making sure people aren t putting their foot in their own ass during the preshow which I doubt they even had.
nah  they had more issues than that. their content legitsucked. they had people like the completionist in there and instead of making the guy who is known for 100  clearing games play videogames  they had him play with toy cars and shit. the identity politics sure didn t do any positives  but they had serious issues with content on top of that. g4 had a place back then  but nowadays  I d honestly rather watch other gaming channels  like the completionist than watch the gringy twich-esque content g4 pushed out.
@7gmeister  amen ! we have someone else who gets it
the most bare minimum are takedown the vid  and dont talk about it anymore
@yudh08  they did months after they realized it killed all their growth  but it was way too late
even then they would ve still been done tbh.
even if g4 did that  it would ve still failed. there was nothing really worth watching
@liam wynne  fire frosk because she said something that hurt her employer s bottom line. that is not cancel culture. it is just good business.
@sanjay kapur  I highly doubt she s responsible - at least not fully. the show was a pile o asshole hair anyways and had low viewing figures on their vids so it was only a matter of time before the show got farted on
@7gmeister  one of my greatest pleasures in life is noting these absolutely hilarious contradictions. and they are everywhere. even inside us. those are the truly magnificent hilarities  the contradictions inherent in ourselves.
fact!
heard correctly with critical drinkers voice and effects
nope  even if they had fired her all that would have done was extend the life by like a year or so maybe. mainly because they are a new kid in an area that is saturated in better creators.
@liam wynne  I would not consider it a cancel culture firing. a cancel culture firing can be predicated on having done something ten years or more  that  may not even happen with the current employer  that is now being now brought to light.  in frosk s case she insulted their current audience.
@liam wynne  no fire her because she   said something on video that didn t necessarily align with the views of the owners and the business model  and alienated people that were not part of her woke rant
@morley robertson  so  Imean technically she was correct with her rant  just not the method she chose. she should have maybe issued an apology or something  not been given the sack. I dont like to see people losing their jobs for saying something I disagree with  Im not an sjw
I watched a little at first.  thought the talking heads weren t entertaining.  seemed boring so I un-subbed and found better you tubers that talked gaming.
they get what they learned
@liam wynne  its a workplace.not  cancel culture .how about companies and employees stop trying to enforce ideology on customers and if customers go elsewhere  stop accusing them of being biggots.I know it feels good to accuse others of supporting  cancel culture   but doesnt make it true.businesses have no business pulling this crap and should be fired.sadly  this is one of those companies that wanted to force ideals onto customers..so instead of a firing  they went down with her.public has spoken...no need for your  product ..is that really  cancel culture  .
@fatgoat  yeah and most workplaces have a strike system in place
well  get froked g4
if thats the case then why is g4 shutting down
@fatgoat  no g4 closing isn t cancel culture  rather a result of being a garbage company producing garbage content. I was referring to people calling for frosk to be fired supporting cancel culture. these days folk are too quick to call for people s jobs and its frankly pathetic
this.  but I d add sessler to that as well.   was looking forward to this but couldn t take it.
@allennium falcon   they must ve got hooked on easy esg loans
@liam wynne  well on that we agree.I d have personally tuned in every now and then just to laugh at her hysteria..let 0pl speak  let them make a fool of themself.
olivia munn is not here to be sexy for you nick napolI is not here to look sexy for you
and look where thatsent them
itseem like your friend doesnt have very high standards
thats probably not all they needed to do to be okay
not only foreskin karen aka indiana whack but also adam sesspool!!!!
why do I hear  the message  in the voice of the critical drinker
they probably would have put them in good faith with fans  maybe. though if you look at some videos about g4tv recently  you would realize that is was an entity that was draining more money than bringing in. even before its fallout with its fans. so that would have helped snd prolonged g4tv  but thatspecifically would t have saved them overall. just my opinion I guess.
I love how all these people had to lose their jobs so the message could be said. what about all them and their families
they weren t thinking about their families when they offered the people who make their pay possible!
@vlad the impailer  how do you make their pay possible  did you ever buy anything from the g4 store  the reason why there isn t that many programs on tv based on video games is because there isn t a big market to begin with. boys dont like to spend money.     now  when it comes to the women s market  thats a different story. ever been to a clothing store and notice how much more of a selection women have  its because they ve the money making market.
@grimm light  how so  comcast is being hit by the economy  there s no way frosk is responsible for that. the truth is  g4 lack in content. they didn t have enough programs. all their shows looked the same.
@wulf kriger  tech tv was nearly unheard of. it was a good channel  dont get me wrong. but it was a hobby channel. once again. boys especially older boys dont spend money.
@wulf kriger  wrong! women and young boys are the biggest spenders.  like... boys that beg their mom s for toys. men usually get the cheapest things and sometimes try to make improvements on those items. thats the tech tv audience. but  they had to sell out. they also weren t making that much money.   as for g4  for comcast standard  they never made enough. they lack in content. all their programs looked the same. they should had brought back g4 icons. they should had brought a tech tv hour show  heck  it would had been fantastic if they would had brought in their own animated series as a saturday morning line up. but they didn t. all their shows were like x-play and attract of the show. there was really nothing else. they did not fail because of frosk. it has nothing to do with her.    they just needed other type of programs to bring in audience members from other genres. bringing in wrestling could had helped a little.
@wulf kriger  tech tv was not a house hold name. quite frankly  I dont remember any  company sponsoring the network.   we also need to keep in mind that not every cable provider had g4. time warner didn t. and most ppl who lived in manhattan used time warner as their provider.   once again. the network wasn t diverse enough. what Imean by diverse isn t based on people. Imean in programming. they needed more programs to support the entire network. all of their shows pretty much had the same format. and that was a format of a youtube channel.
@wulf kriger  so then it is agreed the frosk basically had no part of the g4 shut down. the entire network was basically a youtube channel. they all looked the same.  it would had been great if they had a few hacking shows. but they didn t. it was a network with a lack of content.
you can creditsteve crowder for that one.
its supposed to be the whole point.
I just wanna show my appreciation for your oden cringing avatar.
@pop culture rocks  or the hundreds of people who said it before a youtuber
its not for these people  they believe their way of thinking is more righteous and its their duty to call out all those whom do not agree.
its true but its not very profound nor original
one important rule of business  focus on your core customers  the majority   diversity   no focus   bankruptcy.
you just gotta not have expectations  for the multImillion dollar mainstream projects apparently
how does the man keep doing it. just saw the new top gun movie  it was great no politics just a good movie.
people bash cruise for his ideology and religion but at least he acts professional in the workplace. he can also be a funny guy considering his character in trophic thunder which was created by him.
@nemesis the slasher   or when he did that cameo as austin powers in goldmember.
@axel hens  because he starts with the viewer in mind and makes a fun movie for the viewer. his movie isn t a vehicle for his ideology.
corporations are the owners of the products you would plan to gate keep  and those corporations became woke.better gate keep new products like shad s and eric july s.
@hermit card  that goes without saying
agreed
velma
Im afraid so
but isn t but isn t gatekeeping pretty much rendered pointless if the people who own the property also agree with this idealogical bent
ding ding ding!!
yeah  but for some reason the flash doesnt turn me on like melonie...
nakey jakey out here blowing minds as well
fuck I forgot about jabecky
@michael quaid  good point  but we all got our commentators who we feel represent our sentiments and can deliver interesting if not hilarious takes. and g4 probably would have made a huge success in hiring existing youtubers who could ve grown the audience organically.
the actman
he is still around. I see him talk about movies more now  and itseems he usually has good takes.
I loved blair butlers  fresh ink  segments. its how I got into the walking dead comics
too bad about gina darling. she s a good egg
@michael quaid  agreed
@eric staples  not every one who worked there was bad. there was some good people too
@the real stephentv  yes but the problem is the most vocal were the ones that killed it.
@docpsycho  oh I know. Im not doubting that. frosk for one.
@the real stephentv  I honestly forgot all about her.  I hated her during her lec   league of legends  casts.  she had this insane thought process that anyone that disagreed with her was wrong no matter even if it was constructive.  then this all popped up and I was like  yeah that fits her attitude from what I remember
you d think that they would ve done some market research before starting an expensive venture.
I dont feel bad for any of them  not even the low level mooks at the bottom. they had every red flag and warning that this proverbial ship was heading into torpedo-town  at the end of the day you have no other bed to sleep in than the one you yourself made.
dont you think youre being a little bit harsh.I can understand you feeling that way towards the higher up but the more low level guy dont deserve this
@derrick crawford  no. they wouldn t feel remorse if the roles were reversed.
frosk  sexism in gaming....
froskbite
@lavistro  the most infamous line in these modern times
@frequent-blackouts   customers and businesses hate her. see how she shut down an entire company with 1 simple step.
@mike patrona  I dont think I have seen
you mean the ones that clapped like trained seals when the grown child cried  dont like it  dont watch it! peace
yup. gamergate was my first experience in media propaganda as a lad. I saw it from start to finish being twisted into something it totally was not. now days most people not in the know just casually accept that it was some crazy sexist reckoning. its wild.
it ll be another thing that gets brought up everytime some media outlet tries to blame  toxic gamers  for something for the next decade like gamergate lol frosk will be another brianna wu or zoe quinn just painting herself as a victim of it for years
@likeandsharedeeznutsbruh  honestly I think the worm is turning  they cannot continue losing so much money year after year
thats fine  they ll die in obscurity then.
dont give rop  creative  team ideas plz....
my favorite part was when frosk appeared and said  its urrin time!
frosk   lessons learned  look how sexism killed g4
g4tv shoots foot g4tv  who killed hannibal !
I feel sad for the people behind the scenes and hope they can find new work soon but the personalities at g4tv  learn to code.
lesson learned  next time  just talk about red dead online  frosk.also  slightly off-topic  but... place your bets  gentlemen! how long before marvel and jessica gao announce thatshe-hulk  attorney at law  was always intended to be a limited series with no future episodes being planned    update  holy crap  they just did 5 minutes after I wrote this!
recently found this channel and I always appreciate content creators who just speak the common sense things that we all know. subbed
you bring up a very interesting point.  I find myself following youtubers to watch someone with the same views and beliefs as myself instead of watching mainstream entertainment where they just try to cram their views down your throat.
g4 is epitome of wokeness take something loved and wear it as a skin suit
here s the message to the nutjobs that dont play fair  we want you to show up to work  work hard  entertain the fans  earn promotions   get paid. but if you cross that line   you attack the fans that dont agree with you  they are consequences for your actions   those actions are going to be dealt with severely
love your videos melonie  thanks for your hard work.
if that lesson was going to be learned by these corporations  it would have been learned 3 years ago. I have no hope for the future
not ok for those who found out via the social media post. thatsaid  there s an old saying about not biting the hand that feeds
the issue from the get-go was  who was this new g4 for was it for the fans who were in their 20s during its first run in the early 2000s   making them 40 now. orwas it for new gamers  just entering the gaming scene today  a.k.a 20 year olds today.if they were trying to court the younger crowd  there would be minimal brand nostalgia for their product.that is why the network failed. frosk is just the scapegoat.
I was so happy  so optimistic when they relaunched. the original g4 was a favorite channel when I was a kid. it was like what gaming youtube channels are now. sad to see what it became  they were never able to capture the magic.
I feel bad for everyone that lost their jobs so suddenly.
everyone working for a brand has to have the same beliefs or else that one  bad apple  co-worker will put their foot in their mouth and will  ruin the companies image   its sad but true  we see it time and time again. thats why youtubers or rather influencers have it easier that way  one less thing to worry about even when its not just one person and they have a smaller team they can easily manage like pewdiepie  markiplier  jackcepticeye  ect.whats funny is g4tv didnt need that person to fail  sadly it was headed there already unfortunately.
the end of tweet should of read. we stand with frosk
great video melonie
well said! I could not care less what a person looks like  I look for a similar taste in games and thought in who I go to for reviews. regardless of color  gender  or nationality  if someone said that they love kingdom hearts and sly cooper I d be much more interested in their recommendations.
its quite a shame that one person ruined a company. many people whom worked at the company are now out of jobs and its also truly disgusting in how this company handled this situation.
this is a prime example of what happens when youre dealing with people who think they re always right  always the smartest ones in the room  and always think they hold the moral high ground. they ll never learn because learning requires you to admit you lack knowledge in something  and these c10wns think they know everything. also  learning helps you grow and mature as a person  and these people think they re perfect and its everyone else who needs to change.
exactly! if you enjoy bands and music who also share these perspectives and opinions and who are ok with speaking out against cancel culture and wokeness. check us out!
so what your saying is youre okay with people shoving politics down your throat as long as you agree with it ... interesting
@red ninja  no  I was merely making a point as to why many people are not watching television as much and are turning to youtube  especially the younger generation. most kids I know dont even watch network or cable television anymore. they consume almost all of their content on youtube. and  they people do gravitate towards people with similar view points. do your core group of friends generally share the same views on most things  do people that tend to lean left watch a lot of content the has right leaning content  or vice-versa
the original g4  xplay  cheat  sweat  cinematech  arena  etc  worked because they were what eventually youtube  specifically gaming channels  would become. video game content machines you could watch on tv when back then all we had were magazines and websites that can barely play any videos.
well  they re blaming us for them losing those jobs so...nah.  dont feel sorry at all.
eventually you will grow up
not thatsuddenly. its been comming for months.
to be fair  it wasn t just frosk. she just became a figurehead. any company that cant survive one rant is a weak company. the fact they couldn t pull out of that very easy-to-fix fall was the fault of the higher ups. they are the ones that truly failed everyone.
it wasn t just 1 person and it was how they handled the situation after thatsunk them. all they had to do was fire her and apologize for her outburst to show that they dont stand with her. instead they did the opposite by attacking the fans acting like its everyone else who should revolve around them. they clearly never knew their audience let alone know that their  ideology  is only accepted by a small niche crowd.
it was not just this incident  investing millions in the shows of substandard entertainment not to mention a 88million pound office. plus paying for network space on tv then not being able to fill it with anything worthwhile. the money invested was to cash in on the supposedly imminent esports boom that is yet to happen. the money wasted here is quiet spectacular
frosk does look a little bit crazy. her face resembles hillary clinton and ursula von der leyen of the eu. these women tend to get the same haircut and wear similar clothes and act in a similar fashion. coincidence  I think not.
if you dont like it   dont watch it   frosk 2022.
this entire exercise was like a master class in how not to run a gaming channel  they paid out the nose for a massive arena-style studio  they talked about games nobody is playing anymore  they openly admitted that their personalities weren t the ones actually playing these games  they flew influencers out to shill for them at hundreds of k s a pop--yeah  adam and indiana being little crybullies on twitter and in front of the camera was probably their killshot  but it deffo wasn t the only nail in the coffin for this prehistoric business model.
I couldnt help but wonder how this would have went down if the hostesses on g4 were a little easier on the eyes for us
as a wrestling fan I am sad for xavier woods austin creed because he genuinely wanted to be a g4 host for like ever
the big cope is real  happens every time. they attack their own base as an act of wokejustuce over some minor issue  then attack their base again for the backlash against the first attack. audience leaves of course and then the base gets attacked yet again for not  supporting  the previous set of madnesses. all so some narcissistic host or  personality  can have their public virtuemoment. twisted stuff
the woke never learn  because they never get over themselves.
I feel bad for g4 s security guards  secretaries  drivers  electricians  set dressers  lighting technicians  audio engineers  it folks  hair makeup wardrobe dept  personal assistants  cameramen  interns  and so on.in other words  I feel bad for folks who were staying in their lane  simply doing their jobs  and keeping their personal views and opinions to themselves.
frosk will forever be known as the person who killed an entire channel. she ll be so radioactive the only job she ll be able to get on a studio floor is mopping it !unfortunately a lot of people who worked very hard on the channel lost their jobs. but frosk has always been about sending her message  she couldn t care less about the people that worked there.
I dont feel sorry for frosk  but I feel sorry for those who ended up getting screwed by her attitude.
the messed up part of this is that the g4 employees had to find out they lost thier job via twitter  they didn t have the spine to call them and tell them g4 is letting them go. this is why you dont attack your audience.
I think tweets like that just show people like him for how they really think about stuff  and why often in the long term they tend to fail.
g4tv   we want gamers to watch our stuff! also g4tv   if you dont like it  dont watch! also g4tv   why is nobody watching us  and our brand burning to the ground in a woke  garbage-filled dumpster fire  frosk  holding gasoline and matches with shocked pikachu face
trying the same thing over and over hoping for different results is the definition of insanity
I think the last second announcement was par for the course with business shutdowns. if a closing company gave ahead notice  some employees may be tempted to walk off with property.
the three rules of wokists 1  they always project2  they always strawman3  they always double down
jirard I wish you the best.adam sessler and frosk deserved it. but you and xavier woods were good people.both just focus on your youtube channels and making quality content
frosk has got to be the funniest looking human ever. Im just saying
another important factor was frosk s reveal that all reviews are scripted. with that any respect towards the hosts was gone. even if someone came to g4 to watch i.e. jirard  they knew that on this channel they would not get any honest opinions from him.
man who knew that gamers had so much integrity. from gamer gate to this I have to commend my gamers out there for not taking any shit.
after a few minutes of one episode I wanted to watch something different.
@red ninja  blah blah blah
4  they always accuse others of what they themselves do
@true native scot  that would be projecting.
@duncan mcokiner  yeah but they re  so guilty of it  it needs to be said at least twice.
also gina darling is a good one. I wish she  could work with geeks and gamers
@michael quaid  indeed I hope she s alright too
you wrote this comment like you actually expect those people to read it.
@stacey funk  nope not at alljust giving my honest opinion
@thewildwolf  yes  but you wrote it out as though you were speaking to them  not about them. addressing them by name in the first person. thats the weird part.
@stacey funk  Im just doing what I always do its more rhetorical
it is  its rough to look at and this cracks me up lol
last comment was strait fax dont get into a profession where you have to rely on the people you hate to pay your bills.
I totally agree with gina and the completionist who got grouped with frosk and woke crew. completionist just wanted to make gaming content and gina is an avid gamer if you knew her from her previous works.
the other guys on the couch and adam clapping like a seal  they were complicit. any pushback by anyone there that day may have kept viewers. but no they were cowards
honestly she was the problem after that rant  proud of everyone who really remember why g4tv was popular in the first place! attacking your audience didn t happen back then and we wont allow it now
when g4tv came back I was hopeful. when you launch a gamer oriented channel  then make it antI gamer. dont wonder why it failed.the amount of hatred and anger emitted by the hosts both on their own private social media and on stage was truly epic. how to relate and represent a gamer  play games. know about games. have actual fun playing and talking about games.
total biscuit was a personality whose opinions were generally respected  but definitely not always agreed with.
it wasn t gonna work I dont think even before the frosk rant. theres alot of streamers and youtube channels who do a similar thing but with way less overhead costs.  like that building they have is enormous for what is basically a youtube channel  twitch stream. less employees too  you could do it with a handful of people honestly.
Im an old school g4 fan from back when it was techtv and had no idea it got revived. looks like I didn t miss out on much.
this is just a part in the systematic approach in destroying the validation of our past.  call them out.  keep up the good work.
the fact that he didn t that gg started in 2014 tells me all I need to know about his cred.
frosk    shoots g4 in the face also frosk   sexism has killed g4
if there s one thing anyone can learn from g4tv and other media failures  its this  never attack your audience!
instead of just screening out job applicants for questionable party pics  how about flagging the rabid ideologues that will doom your brand  frosk and this other dude are poison  unemployable
rip g4tv  sometimes nostalgia cant save you from ignorance of being woke bc at the end of the day its supposed to be entertaining  I hope the completionist can bounce back
and this is why I would rather follow and listen to you and others who actually put the things we love and share first instead  and not bash fans bcuz of dumb politics
if nothing else  g4 inspired chrissie mayr s froskbitten rap  which will forever live as a spoof rap
this downfall is the only thing I really know about the latest g4.  I never watched any other video or actually know anybody who watched the new version.  other than watching its downfall
finally  some good news in 2022.
it would ve shut down regardless of frosk s comments. they werent getting enough viewers to sustain themselves before and after frosk. what little I saw of the new g4tv  it didnt look much better than any other basement filmed youtube video. and you got people like adam sessler who just did occasional videos from his home  it didnt have the high budget of a tv show.
it all started with wendy s and their rude  sarcastic but kinda charming twitter account. and like the industry works  all saw it and thought  great  we copy that!   they just weren t as charming and nuanced....so they just started to think that it is completley ok to dump on their customers.and with this mindset embedded the wokeness came. now they thought they can do zilch and still earn money. so all of these combined  the wrong idea of how to treat customers  wokeness  ineptitude and laziness emerged as the entertainment industry dark age we have now.
g4tv was never popular.techtv was.

I couldn t care less about any of them. did you perhaps forget that when frosk said what she said all the tools in the studio applauded her  well  then they too deserve what they got!
they will never learn.  they will keep insulting fans because in their demented mind that is how they will gain more fans.  I am old and I remember the original show  let it die and I will keep my memories of the og show.frosk killed it and I hope she does not find another job in the gaming industry.  she can go work for the woke comic industry since it is already dying and there is no more damage she can do there.
I dont feel sorry for them  they did it to themselves  in their mind they just cant fathom its their fault. I believe its called arrogance and they appear to have it in abundance.
they should ve cut frosk after her insane rant- oh wait  its all for the message.
as frosk said peace out g4 done.    that goes for adam too
hey...love your work! keep it up!  3
this pisses me off  this had gina darling cry on her stream last night. I wish these people would sue frosk for there job loss.
dang every time I look you have another 10k followers!  so legit you deserve it
I thought they relaunched on the web only. I literally had no idea they tried out a tv channel again. or why the hell they had sooooo many people. they had no focus from the get go.
smashing that f in chat
hImelonie Im digging your camo shirt.it reminds me when u  few other youtubers were invited to do military exercises skills  you all done great job.that being said as always you haddone another wonderful video.takecare melonie
a channel with nothing but sara underwood reading the phone book would literally get better view numbers than what they chose to put on air.
why dont you get on the phone and call them up  tell them your ready to restart the whole channel.
keeping it real  g4 needed a melonie mac  someone who is a gamer who has their own opinions but treats everyone with genuine respect.
youtubers are genuine  raw and real  not some pretentious polished turd that they shove in our face and tell us that we re supposed to like it.I always looked at youtube like public access television  like wayne s world.
shitting on your audience was never a good business strategy
the irony is  this video cost  90 to produce and it garnered more views than the g4 videos that cost  9million to produce.
dont work with or hire activist is one of the lessons out of many from g4 lol
this was the perfect example of get woke go broke lmfaoo
jirard will be fine  he was doing his own thing before g4. id imagine gina will be ok too.
75k subs coming soon! great content!!
but what about emily  abbey  megan  jo  jane  zipper  pocket  scissors  tape dispenser   and filing cabinet    f
can a lesson be learned from this   several I think lesson one  dont hire frosk if you want your new project to survive.lesson two  dont hire the dumb feck who hired frosk to manage your new project if you want your new project to survive.lesson three  dont tell your target market demographic not to use your product  its a really bad idea  they might be listening.lesson four  if you must tell your target market demographic not to use your product only do it when they re not listening  try distracting them with someone hot so they dont hear youlesson five  test results indicate frosk isn t hot enough to distract them enough if you attempt to circumvent lesson three with the suggested strategy from lesson four  use someone hotter.there may be others
Im hungover  been drinking whisky for about 18 hrs  have a sick bucket for security and now watching random stuff on youtube. dont drink folks.she s is stunning.love from scotland
couldn t have happened to more deserving people
besides frosk and clapping seal sessler  who has been insane for a while   I do feel bad for the guys and gals that worked there with some common sense.
my thoughts well itsucks some of the good people who if they were good lost their jobs. but my counter on that  you stood by and did nothing  you allowed that to happen.  the only way for evil to prevail  is for good men to do nothing  - edmund burke
never really watched tech tv g4 since my family didn have the channel and I was also serving in the military and didnt have a tv in my barracks room and also was deployed during the 00s  sucks lots of people lost their jobs. frosk really did a number on the revival.
g4 tv could have had some badass podcasts and live show. in fact  they should have just done attack of the show but more spicy and they could have gotten off the ground and then some. also  adam sessler and frosk should be run out of town  and never let anywhere near a camera or twitter ever again
at first felt bad for the aimless circle like that fella...and then I didn t.
dude  that thumbnail tho chrissy looks more like frosk than frosk does.
xavier woods was the best part of g4tv  and I think he s going to be okay. I do feel bad for jirared though
dang frosk looks like she s been sinking into some hardcore drugs!
who saw this comin
g4 could have been so much  really sad things worked out so badly just because of personal choices.
let g4 tv be a lesson for other companies  when you have an employee like frosk you fire them immediately you dont just keep them around.
frosk and co has a lot to learn from you.
I cant believe they thought having frosk on was a good idea  even after the relaunch.
the problem with those who say they are woke is how intolerant they are to everyone else who disagrees with them. they call everyone sexist when its really them who are. they say they are against hate but are so hateful themselves.
and this is why you dont let lesbian tony hawk talk shit to the people paying your rent.
thank you so much  Im so excited
rofl
protect this woman at all cost.
when rebooting a show if you consider the original to be  problematic  then just dont do it.  create something new to appeal to the fanbase you want  otherwise you are going to inherit a fanbase you hate and they will hate you as well after you inevitably tear apart what they loved about the original.
give your patrons what they came for and dont shove anything extra down their throats. they will come back for more if the product is good. insult your patrons to their faces and tell them they can go find service elsewhere is the perfect way to lose those patrons. this is simple to understand.
g4 died a second time for protecting what they use to make fun of. if you use to watch g4 back in the day  you know what Imean.
but can a lesson be learned from this by the gaming industry     .........also no.
frosk lacks 6 things  personality  style  attitude  popularity  dental hygiene   the goods
g4   this is what happens when you dont use enough fire!!! comcast   this isnt working we have to part ways.  g4   hold on!!! we still got has in the can!!!!
I remember a time  not so long ago  that I had no idea how any presenters  actors  or singers voted. I had no idea about their ideologies. twitter and facebook have destroyed that  because they are compelled to expose their beliefs. they now have to conform whether they want to  or not.or else.
g4tv you will come back next time listen to your fanbase.
hey melonie I just wanted to tell you that it is so sad that g4 is gone forever. anyway all the g4 company had to do is to just fire frosk and get back to the normal routine and they will be just fine from now and forever  ok melonie. anyway I just wanted to tell you that and I just wanted to make a comment about this topic of your video  ok melonie. anyway I hope you are doing well with yourself and hope you are enjoying your time with your family with them living at your house. anyway hope you have a wonderful and great blessed day   evening at your house with your pets and your family melonie. anyway have a great day and week.
itsounds like some of them are clearly in denial about what caused this to tank.  Im sure it ll take a bunch of failures before they finally figure it out.
alright a new video
wow  I get thatsome people dont care about their looks and thats fine but its honestly as if frosk is intentionally trying to be as ugly and repulsive as possible. being that ugly takes effort.
what killed g4 was falling to adapt to changing times
g4tv you will come back next time please listen to your real fanbase. dont be fake be real for the fanbase the real for them.
let s not pretend that g4 was doing so great before frosk s rant.
its over for g4tv buddy boyos!
I take exception to ryan s tweet.  I was being bigoted in cod lobbies in 2007.  everyone in cod lobbies was bigoted in 2007.  it was how we bonded.  Ive got friends of all races from those lobbies that I still game with.
frosk can always team up with eichner. they have similar promotional strategies. maybe they can both work on bros 2.
watching g4 die was like obi-wan watching anakin burn. you were the chosen one g4! it was said you would destroy gaming sjw s  not join them! bring balance to gaming journalism not leave it in darkness!g4  I hate youuuuu!
its kinda funny because bigotry is defined as  an obstinate or intolerant devotion to your own beliefs or opinions . describes woke progressives very well
I remember that cod lobby back then  my feelings are still hurt man! I remember telling a guy there I wished he would die! thats right! all good honest fun.
frosk looks like machine gun kelly s angry brother.
morgan webb and olivia munn combined wouldn t even have been enough to save g4 from the flames caused by arsonists frosk and sessler.
nicholas cage be like  not the completionist!!!  o  o
hey melonie I am glad you are believing in your Christian faith and thoughts on the yakuza games
it always comes down to voting with youre time and wallet.
more than anything  this is a problem of entertainment industries having lost sight of the fact that good customer service is vital to their business. if you miss treat your customers  they will take their business elsewhere  and you will lose out on their money. you cannot remain long in business without great customer service. they need to stop attacking the fans. whether they agree with the fans or not isn t relevant. the fans are the customers  and the end users and consumers of their products. if they continue to miss treat them  they will take their business elsewhere  and there is no new market. if the geeks go away  there s no one else there to play.
what was g4 tv    I feel so old.
g4 is best remembered in the past when it was good
great  I can now go back to not knowing who or what a frosk is. poor filing cabinet though!
its always someone else s fault. the one thing you have to be mindful of before you put out a statement like ryan did  is do not get your emotions get the best of you. you cant lash out at people for something they had no involvement in. when you dont listen  there will be consequences.
yes  the lesson is... dont hire frosk and borrow a coors light from your neighbor. skol!!!
Im not a shallow person but my Lord frosk is rough
next up  fan-blamers failing upwards
well said and spot on.  its a shame that the perceived method to building an audience is attacking that entire audience and blaming them for the opinions of a small minority of the population.  fricking ridiculous.
oh no  who could ve foreseen this
absolutely was obsessed with attack of the show when I was younger. olivia munn was hilarious. another victim of woke bullshit.
off topic but your camera quality is Godlike! I have to know what she is using
I honestly didn t see the revival lasting even without frosks rant or adams hot takes. it was doomed to fail because g4tv is no longer needed and they lost touch with a generation of gamers that dont even remember them.
so much of the attitudes from the people who worked at g4 and not taking accountability for what went wrong is text book narcissism
I feel so sorry for those who have the passion for this to lose their jobs for frosk s stupidity. I think the so called woke activists need to put their beliefs aside and do their job. I hope the gaming media community will never forgive frosk for this. frosk  stop biting the hands that feed you!
thank you!    sony a6400 with sigma lens and elgato cam link
let s go frosk!!! seal claps
honestly the only individuals I feel for. are those who lost their jobs because of frosk and adam sessler who are terrible individuals as a whole. this didn t surprise me one bit. lol
g4 was one of those escapes as a kid. the fact that im happy it failed after being insulted by the hosts just goes to show how backwards evergthing is.
did it turn out that frosk s rant was her own doing  or was this something pushed and scripted behind the scenes  and frosk was just the mouthpiece
real talk  hoping and praying the entertainment industry completely and irreversibly collapses and is replaced with something better.
g4 employees that were fired got frosk bitten!
perhaps frosk should have thought about what they said.
imo  g4 worked so well back in the day because gaming nerd culture was so niche  back when it was a made up of small groups of passionate and creative individuals and companies that many people could relate to when it wasn t cool. nowadays the mainstream media influence and woke agendas are trying to be pushed into a culture that once use to be so unique through things retconning established lore and characters to fit a narrative.
let this be a lesson to all the idiotic incompetent management - control your employees.
why is human society forced to go   to a bad way
I was excited for g4tv to return  mostly nostalgic reasons but Im glad I never watched
fine by me. I always held a grudge since they killed techtv.
thought that g4 was awesome at the start and as it went on began to hate them because their view toward me and most gamers became clear. we were despised and it was obvious.
frosk  she acts exactly how she looks lol
sure puts a whole new spin on madcow disease.
peak irony  frosk said that  women dont exist to be easy on the eyes for you   then the only people who continued to watch thought she was easy enough on the eyes to simp for! she alienated every other gamer no matter their political affiliations
great point... g4tv was more a cult than gamers tv
that never felt like a real  genuine  attempt at reviving g4  planned failure.  there was no takishI s castle reruns at like 2am!!!!
g4 was losing money. they had 2 options.1. sack their staff and hire actual gamers to review games2. sack their staff and shutdown.they picked option 2. execs  quite possibly  engineered the frosk rant to justify a shutdown!  the staff were losing their jobs anyhow.
what g4 might have done was hurt the video gaming industry. some people will see this as them saying  video games are only for some people  not you  its a far stretch this could happen but look at the comic book scene....people are leaving dc and marvel comics and going to independent comic companies instead and also manga. same could happen to video games.
so noboddy
@axel hens  Im sure there was at least a few they kept going months after  someones eyes were hungry for a taste of daddy s little disappointment!
right wing insels    so  did she have all these peoples  voter registration information
it was frosk and adam that I feel where the biggest reasons it ranked if they would of fired them and anyone like them that hate fans and apologized to the fans people would of cane back. but no they doubled down and this is what happens.
if you do have this kind of outlook that your viewer base are all right wing incels then why do you wanna be in a job that is dependent on them to pay your bills  -melonie mactop nominee for comment of the year right there.
great speech! I will quote you  thank you very much.  b
people on twitter are coping and seething and saying the frosk sexism rant wasn t the reason why g4 shut down a second time.the modern g4 obviously wasn t gonna reach the same level as youtube gaming channels and twitch streamers  but if they at least respected their core fanbase and gave them what they wanted  they wouldn t have shut down so soon.
lol I still dont even know what g4 was. what was supposed to happen if a guy like me   a hardcore gamer  doesnt know that it even exists.
g4 2.0 was never going to work.  if anything frosk overplaying her hand was emblematic of what was going on there  behind the scenes.  even if she hadn t  I cant see this relaunch going longer than a year or two.  Imean  the market space has changed fundamentally from 15 years ago  not to mention the massive cultural shift to social justice narratives in all spaces of entertainment.  those of us who remember the before times really dont interact much with these new instances.
well  when you yell at your fan base  call them sexist  and then demand   if you dont like it  dont watch it   what did they expect
what s so bad those people that work for g4 found out on social media site they had no jobs.
so  ryan looses his job because frosk torpedoes the channel and his response is regurgitate her words making himself a liability and a risk for any that might have hired him. good luck finding a new job  ryan.
I was hearing the buzzwords before the frost rant.
all the worthwhile folks from g4 will find work. the completionist will absolutely get another deal.
since everyone had covered this I was going to skip the video. but there s a follow up video so I ll see both lol
well said!
frosk single handedly killed g4. if they had brought back olivia munn and morgan webb  the results would probably have been successful.
blame frosk for this!!!
I didnt watch g4 but after that frost bs and them doubling down I had no desire regardless of what they showed.
its always a good day when a woke af organisation goes down. and if that wasn t enough we get to enjoy the salt. that guy didn t need to add to our enjoyment  but its always welcome. time  to eat up your words swallow your prideopen your eyes kudos if you get the reference
jirard is pretty chill but itsucks that the people he surrounds himself with cant shut up about their political opinions in almost everything
its a shame what happened to g4tv  but man am I so tired of being preached at...
the business model was untenable. the views req d to keep them afloat on youtube would ve had to be x10 to pay the bloated staff that they had. the frosk rant and attitude to their viewers was just a nail in the coffin.
Imean  let s be real. not a single person involved in gonna learn any lesson whatsoever  only double down on their bs and blame everyone and everything before they take responsibility for sinking their own ship.
lot  of salt at g4 but they had it coming
they will never learn or admit fault
short  their yt stream number had bots and barely had 100 viewers. friday night tights stay having 12g on 5 hr livestreams.
what exactly did frosk do  I keep hearing about how she sunk g4tv by hating the fans  but what exactly did she do though  I tried looking around  but no luck.
I think that g4 might have had a chance. it would not have been the resounding financial success they hoped it would. its an outdated format. if I want gaming news I go on youtube. there s lots of gamers on there that I can get the straight info from and even some pretty damned funny playthroughs without painfully unfunny skits or attempts at irreverent humor.if theyd have followed a smaller and more straight forward set up like many youtubers they might have done better. miss mac however is right  frosk needs the finger pointed directly at her in a lot of this. g4 was coming back already behind the 8 ball and then frosk goes off on this unhinged rant. there s gamers out there who didn t pay attention or care about gamergate that got sick of this  everyone is sexist  bullshit from just having to listen to anita saarkesian poke her head up to get relevance every few years. gamers are fucking sick of it. we ve heard it all before. so much so Im not even sure what misoginy means anymore. we know that its 90 percent bullshit. and still they tried this bullshit again in 2022. you get what you Goddamned deserve.
sees weiner dogs waddling around in the background
I feel bad for folks like jerard. haven t heard much from him in reguards to the rant or anything but hes now tied to this shitstorm forever. Imean he will be fine with a massive fanbase and platform  but so many others are super screwed. you could see his oh shit face during the rant. there s plenty of others who dont have his following that are probably not gonna come through
ouchiewawa  that last statement went boom!
God damn that thumbnail of frosk is hard on the eyes.
that ryan guy wasn t blaming the  right wing incels . he actually said its a shame that people will blame that rather than their show s direction being wrong for the target audience. at least in his first tweet. I d never even heard of g4tv  so maybe they had bigger problems than their content and leadership.
frosk was though 1000000  on point with one thing she said but she didn t go far enough.  she said something about not being as  bangable  as some other lady.  where she got it wrong was  less bangable   rather than what she actually is  positivally  not bangable  at all for 100000000 stupid reasons.
you look very good without eyeliner.
not one of those working at g4 said one iota. none. they could have left and sought employment elsewhere. none said   this is wrong.  while at g4. I have zero empathy with  silent  voices just for a paycheck. yet  everyone has their own take.
if you dont like it dont watch it bit them in the ass didn t it
seems like a show about gaming should actually be on twitch.
Im in the camp of people who have no sympathy what so ever for anyone at g4 that lost their jobs. its nice to think that normal people were employed but Ive seen nothing but the opposite. sure the completionist might not have attacked the fans but he went along with it out of fear of losing his job which makes him just as bad imo
went woke  went broke
who knew spitting on your fans and telling them not to watch wasn t the best idea
it would be nice if it were frosk and adam sesspool who were gone forever.
something about sexism in video games because people were apparently saying she wasn t as hot as the old hosts while adding that they didn t exist to be good looking for the audience. she ended it with the classic  dont like it  dont watch it .
@brand  ahhh ok  that makes sense. thanks for answering!
diversity of thought can only work with mutual respect and acceptance  or at the very least the free-speech mindset that even if we have different views  we re both entitled to have those views and we dont hate each other for them.  there are some content creators I like who dont make political content  but I know our politics are different  and every so often I have to turn my brain off when they make comments or jokes at the expense of my political demographic  because I know that they are brainwashed by the media to think Im stupid and evil.  imagine if hosts on some gaming show had a similar dynamic  like   fuck your opinion on this video game you troglodyte insurrectionist  meanwhile Im just trying to give an opinion on cod or something...
g4 xplay failed because it originally was popular in the early 2000 s before youtube was even a thing. people watched it because it was one of the only places for game reviews at the time. these days though so many youtube channels put out better reviews and content that g4 isn t needed anymore.
they are going to make g5tv.
I blame frosk and the company initially standing by her nonsensical rant.
melonie what are your thoughts on the situation with bayonetta
frosk was speaking facts and that tweet youread was facts. multiple videos abt this are referencing  wokeness . ppl are obviously blaming  woke  culture. also I dont understand what s wrong with calling out ur fan base if its toxic
he s restricted responses to his tweets to people he follows or has mentioned. kinda shows how much he actually believes the shit he s dribbling.
we dont want to take credit for our network failing  so here  have some conspiracy theories.
frosk was 75  responsible for this  adam sessler 10   the other 15  other issues and people. as another poster said all they had to do was fire frosk after her rant and sessler etc for doubling down on her statements and apologize to the fans. these people in the media really need to feel some pain like this for being such hate filled political cultists.
is that really frosk in the thumbnail
best diversity hiring ever.
ironically if g4 fired frosk right at the beginning everyone would have been happy.  frosk would get to play martyr and g4 would have gained viewers.
4 10 you see  ryan  thats the difference between you and me...I have a job.
preemptively attacking your audience is just a bad business strategy in any company in general.
11 25 Im here for the doggo.
lesson not learned however this should serve as a cautionary tale for up and coming businesses never hire activists
I used to really like g4. I didn t know it got revived and died again.
narcissists cant learn. entitled people will always be upset when they dont get their way. these are grown adults who caused their own downfall but like spoiled brats they would always throw temper tantrums when they are not successful or rewarded. the moral of the story cannot get to them but life surely will.
it appears these people only get into the industry to shame a fanbase they hate.  they are not using misogyny  racism  etc as a copium excuse.  that is how they want the audience to view it.  they never cared about creating success with the audience  they wanted to create a self-fulfilling prophecy that invalidates the existence of that audience in the first place.
Imiss sarah underwood
the thing I dont understand about frosk... why would anybody willingly look like shit   she has the family money to do anything  and she chose to be ugly.why
may the unsanctified corpse of g4 be lain to rest for the second  and hopefully  last time. we are past the era that the og g4 could survive  and adam sesspit was part of rev3games  a gaming channel similar to the xplay show  that did not survive and it was at least competent compared to modern g4 before it too died. if neither rev3 or og g4 could survive  reanimating the skeleton of past g4 by baptizing it in the wells of wokeness and mediocrity with a heavy toll of cash as payment was certainly not going to go well.
rip g4 haha. maybe they ll replace it with the melonie mac go boom boom show!
I dont really feel bad for the people that lost their jobs. anyone that didnt see this coming had already drunk the koolaid. anyone that is worth feeling bad for Im sure already left or had a backup plan in place.
seems like these human resources people are acting like kids taking this crap to social media. this is not how itshould be treated. sadly....these people will be running things very soon and I think the hr people should be fired for doing it this way.
sad thing is peope who are toxic to a business like frosk will just sail onto some  new role to be apart of some diversity quota
the hilarity is most of their viewership would have been bolstered by the people who loved the original g4. those people would by now have lived through 2 decades of woke activism and been hopefull for something that thrived on being unfiltered  high school comedy  and raunchy af. the very people they chose to be totall asshats to.
I had almost no idea g4 came back until I heard itshut down again. very little promotion to me  so they cant blame me for not watching. who said what to piss everyone off
ulta created a podcasts for young woman and makeup. it features to trans-woman who are older telling teenage woman about how it is being a woman. that is what g4tv decided to do with an entire network.
my biggest thought is  I wonder where the black hype man is now   we all know the one   thats right let em know!!!  that guy... where is that guy
I feel bad for the people who lost their jobs and actually wanted to provide content for gamers and gaming. I dont know who green-lighted the inappropriate hating - but somebody did green light it! there s no way that frosk woman could go off without prior approval. Im actually tired of bringing in all the weird when we re talking about gaming. isn t it  by definition  weird enough  the only angst I want addressed would be technical problems glitches with games updates  etc. although I ll say that in minecraft the glitches are part and parcel of what makes the game fun.
why feel sorry for  them being down  they want be  sorry for you  being  down   they will be  extremely  happy
g4 should have been a handful of youtube shorts at best.  what gamers watch tv anymore
g4 spends millions of dollars for studio and office space they dont need  and thousands of dollars just to book guests  all while trying to revive a media model that died out in the 2010s because it was unfeasible then.but for some reason a lot of people on the internet really want to blame one person for some reason.
g4tv was great when it was airing. the re-launch would have been fine except frosk had to add her politics to it instead of just talking about the games.
us normal people cant have anything these days huh
Ive been a gamer since the atarI 2600 and Ive never heard of these people and I dont care if they re unemployed I have absolutely no idea why everybody seems to give a shite but I dont
the sad part is woke institutions will not learn their lesson from this.
wokeness  is definitely not the reason why g4 failed. it was a high production program attempting to mimic streamers who have less than a faction of the production budget and it tried to revive that  cable station  feeling the original g4 channel had. g4 was destined to failed.
games are more than just an investment of money  they re an investment of time. when I was younger  I had more time than money. now its the opposite. either way  I depend on accurate reviews to wisely spend my money and time. I dont want to hear about the social justice practices of the creator  just lemme know if the game is good or not. g4 wouldn t do that  so frosk or no frosk they were no good to me. that being said  her little diatribe didn t help.
I am confused  why did she freak out   another chad ghosts her
oh well. it is what it is. this really shows how some companies  brands care about their employees. edit    even if some we re woke  they deserved a better way of finding out they lost their job. its unprofessional to fire all your staff with a tweet.
g4 go boom !
kinda scary that one rant developes in such a political drama. Imean frosk was right about pretty girls having it easier. but to say that it is due to sexism that the audience prefers some other dude is a pretty bold claim. maybe they just like or trust him more   no it must be because people hate women
any takes on cdpr going esg not gonna support a company thats pushing that no matter how much edge runners get the hype train.
you have a lucky chair.
it isn t a surprise.  the lesson is there  but they are blind.
what  youre telling me that the huge feminist audience didn t outweigh the losses of the gamers that frosk alienated from watching the show Im shocked! why its almost as if the people who agreed with frosks rant  aren t the people who would watch g4tv in the first place! really makes you think doesnt it
firing frosk wouldn t have fixed anything  nor would apologizing. the show wasn t good  plain and simple. there are tons of excellent shows on youtube that talks about gaming and that cover gaming journalism. g4 was supposed to be a gaming channel but rarely covered topics that were important to gamers. g4 was selling a product that nobody wanted to buy  and they went out of business because of it. the lesson here shouldn t be that frosk should have kept her mouth shut or that censorship should be enforced within the gaming community but that businesses are selling a product if your product isn t good  then the product wont sell  and if your salesmen are incompetent  then they wont convince the customer to buy the product. this is not a case of go woke go broke but of basic business acumen.
never heard about g4tv.
they should have hired you  instead of foreskin or whatever she calls herself. youre charming  effervescent  positive  energetic-the total opposite of that ghoul with the at-least-seventeen-years-out-of-date emo haircut.
this chick seems cool subscribed!
I will forever clown the completionist for his involvement in thatshitshow.he stood here during that rant and clapped at the end. he is the very definition of a sell out with zero integrity and respect for his audience.never forget  never forgive.
its bizarre how big the disconnect between the fans and the content creators can be. am I happy that  woke ideology  isn t being widely embraced  yes. do I care what becomes of the ones who lost their job that isn t pushing  woke ideology  somewhat. if they are worth their paycheck then this should only be a small setback. I really wish I was a fly on the wall listening in on frosk and the rest of her cronies trying to justify their actions while they demonizing the vast majority of their fans who dont fall for  woke ideology  and canthink for themselves. I kind of feel sorry for them in a small way because of how little they understand about how disgenuine that culture is and why it will  hopefully  never be embraced.
lesson learned lol.  as if these people learn xd I dont think they do honestly.
the g4 ship was already sinking. frosk decided to insure it got to the ocean floor. period
the annihilated themselves and they wont learn anything
when frosk went on thatspoiled brat narcissistic rage I knew that it was done. viewership went down the toilet and never recovered. the new g4 was nothing at all like it used to be. it was g4 in name only. woke just doesnt work. the great majority of people just  dont like it and wont be a part of it. they can scapegoat all they want but the truth still stands.
g4tv could come back be real do not be fake.
they made it public in other to avoid thatsome of the person s that were let off dont have the chance to create tell another narrative.
also love how  gamergate  is still their boogeyman. like dude if its still your talking point  it just shows you are the person that gg would have exposed as a corporate shill.
g4 was doomed from the beginning
anyone know melonie s outro song
melonie would of been a better host. one day it will return to non-woke normal and we can finally get on with our lives in a better fashion.
g4tv you will come back next time listen to your real family. yes  do not listen to a fake fan base.
g4 could ve survived the froskurrin rant had they brought in morgan webb   olivia munn. instead  they brought in youtubers and ideologues  adam without morgan   a total wreck!kevin   aots without olivia  chris gore  and the rest  it didn t help either that they got absolute nobodies outside of their niches like ovilee may outside of lol broadcasting  that wwe guy with the youtube let s play channel  and the like. especially when they took a big name like the completionist  jirard  and paired them with a  former  up-and-comer  the black hokage  just to stifle their mic skills with cringe via sessler  frosk  and the others. I wanted g4 to last soooo badly since it meant a great deal to me growing up  but its incredibly short-lived resurrection only served to reinforce the notions that they only sought to constantly be counter towards ham-fisted   projecting moral superiority on to your audience before you actually have one  or successfully got them back  is a recipe for disaster. same with the mcu  currently . same with volition  burn in hell . same as the majority of these extremely biased media figureheads that do it for the money or to gatekeep sh t they never cared about but want to  change for the better  rest in infinite pieces  g4
Im a recent subscriber  is there a first part of this video  cuz idk what g4tv is or who frosk is
when people in media or entertainment lose their job  our heart strings are pulled. but when a factory shuts down  no one seems to care about those workers. why is that
the supply of copium wont be able to keep up with demand lol
and  why is  woke narrative  always going hand and hand with intolerance and hate-speak      Ive never once seen a  woke  anything thatsaid  hey  we should work together   always just  im right  your wrong .  they remind me of danny divito s character in matilda   im right your wrong  im smart your dumb...
its funny  do they really think only liberals play video games ! !  I remember a time where a video game  movie  or sporting event could bring people together from all backgrounds and political beliefs.  unfortuantely  not anymore  every damn thing has to be political.
I didn t survive   -
alienate an entire audience and expect them to keep watching  let this be a lesson to all the companies that want to employ activists disguised as presenters.
the rant wasn t just about calling out sexists - it was trying to shut down any criticism of black. Im sure a couple idiots did say mean things  but thats no reason to call it out publicly - just block those people and move on. the other thing was that people were criticizing her game knowledge and saying it was worse for her than the men  which is just playing the victim. finally  people rightly called out her hot take that the playstation console is a dead platform  which is just laughable when you look at how successful the ps5 and its games have been.
g4   if you dont like our content  dont watch it! me  ok bet.g4   our content failed because we isolated our core audience who are still a bunch of right wing incels. why did it fail  why didn t we have an audience
get woke go broke for g4
almost every conversation can be had and be professional about it. you cantalk about sexism and diversity  but if you want people to listen  you cant come out accusing them of exhibiting these traits because they dont like the way you deliver the message.
to them the message means more than the profit  too bad for them  the profit is what keeps people s jobs. otherwise  you get roosterteeth.
is a right-wing in cell actually a thing every right-wing person I know has a full-time job.
amazing how much damage one woke person can do to a company.peace.
boycott frosk like she boycotts dental hygiene.
one of the many many reasons I dropped watching g4 is during her rant she let the cat out the bag that their reviews are written by a team....you want me to watch youreview a game you ve barely or have not played   erm no  no no no.there is thousands of gaming reviewers out there  Im spoilt for choice.I ll pick one that doesnt hate people for not voting left and also actually plays the games.
they said half the population should not watch  then blame them for not watching lol
I liked kassem g  gina darling  gerard the completionist  kevin pereira  and  yes  adam sessler  who is fine if you avoid his twitter feed . the problem is they seemed to double down after the frosk rant and attacked their fans and that was the end for g4. they had good pieces in place but they totally mismanaged those pieces and gave the woke garbage preference over the good stuff they had. youre right  melonie. feel sorry for the good people who lost their jobs because of maybe one or two people at g4.
frosk rhymes with bossk. bossk would be a friendlier and prettier host.
wow never even watched the show
thatsucks for someone like me. I hope we can get more shows and networks for woke sjws and feminists that actually thrive
all because frosk is jealous of olivia munn
frankly  if you d hosted g4 instead of that blond broomstick with the mop top and the ugly forced low voice  I  among others  would ve watched it! I didn t even watch g4 anyway. because not only are you way easier on the eyes than frosk  you actually know of what you speak re video games and would ve kept it on topic  I think. them blaming the usual suspects   right wing incels   only tells me that they re in denial and are refusing to take any responsibility for their words and actions  in typical manner. simple as that.
plenty of people who aren t right wing think her rant was idiotic.  he s just proving the point
everyone s fault but their own  I do not feel bad for them.
full stop  Im not sorry or have reservations about celebrating their downfall. we ve seen this how many times now  in particular  this group comes from not just ca but some of the farthest left areas of ca. these people have brought down project after project with out an ounce of shame or a sense of responsibility. I feel for the handful of people who didn t work to make this implode  but they re a very low minority by comparison. if they had an ounce of reason  they d leave the area for somewhere with an actual jobs market that isn t going to implode or is a ticking time bomb in most cases. that goes for silicon valley as well. the hollywood bubble and silicon valley are pretty much one and the same at this point.
the creator of this channel and frosk look very similar...
should have had you be a host. Imean  stuff check out. - gamer  check. - girl  check. - tats  check. attitude  check.- fork was queer  meh  big deal - the media say everybody s a little bI these days  right I guess it must have been fork s winning personality thatsealed the deal.
I love how that delusional guy insisted that  wokeness  wasn t to blame when all of the people that cared enough to comment said exactly that.the original target audience consists of mostly male gamers. the original show had beautiful female co-hosts thatsometimes wore enticing outfits or played suggestive skits games to keep said audience tuning in.the casting director of the new iteration had the galaxy-brain idea to hire an outspoken far left feminist woman with nothing but disgust for gamers in general and coomers in particular.this thing was going to go pear-shaped no matter what and the reason it did was because the woke co-host couldn t keep her hot-takes on toxic gamer culture to herself if it would literally save the jobs of everyone involved in the franchise.now  the hilarious thing is that this was obvious and could have been prevented. frosk had a track history of making bad takes that alienated her colleagues and target audiences. she was never not going to blow up when exposed to the opinions of people that expected the previous type of co-host.the true villain was whoever hired her and put her in the position to fail. this is like hiring a registered sex offender to babysit your teenage daughters without supervision on pool party day while supplying unlimited lotion and then acting shocked and outraged when the inevitable happens.
I really like your hair melonie! hehe I know I said once before but I thought I say it again
going woke is highly profitable  isn t it businesses exist to make money first  hopefully without harming the public and environment secondary!
but honestly good channel
the original g4 came and went at the right time. if it had started in the 2010 s it would ve been shit and this proves it.
I am not totally against the message  but I am against the way it was delivered. frosk really did blow that network up. I appreciate your content and point of view. I think there are a handful of things about the gaming community that you both agree on  I think you have a much more articulate way of putting it  and making it about the actual topic  and not all about you. good stuff as always mmgb!
I prefer the dengar  and ig-88 hour. they have a great rapport and amazing comedic timing.
@brad carver  4-lom and zuckuss reviews made me rush out and buy my friend pedro. they weren t wrong
they didn t even mention that the angry cry baby child brought the whole ship down. no mercy for g4tv gone.
g4. a company that celebrates the gaming community that didn t do let s plays  which is the most basic way to celebrate gaming. by playing and commenting on the games. a company so weak  one rant brought it to its knees and they couldn t recover. thatsituation would have been so easy to fix if they had a pr rep worth being called as such. you ask her to apologize  or she gets fired for not sharing the same vision or goals as the company. a company so untrusted  when they offered viva la dirt league a spot in the g4 company  the entire vldl fanbase was straight up scared for them. the best sentiment on their community post was  um. I hope it goes well  but be sure you can cut ties if you need to. a company so against the idea of community  they cant even tell their own employees that they no longer have a job anymore before posting on twitter.this company failed because the higher ups are failures. sorry this happened to people like jirard  but...there really was no other way for this to go. this was doomed to fail the moment it was poorly conceived. this g4 did not have the energy  the diversity of content  or the strength of character to survive. and  lets be honest here  this kind of nostalgia  the amount of energy  content  and strength needed was exceptionally low.this is nothing to gloat over. this is something to mourn.
if it wasn t for a big daddy paying them they would ve been cancel they wasn t making enough money to pay thatstuff at all they wasn t making enough money to  even pay one person big daddy was paying them to put all this trash contin
part of the problem from the get go was sessler. legit him being an on camera person again lost my desire to watch new g4.  after his anti-anyone that disagrees with leftist thought.
why was the og g4 cancelled back in the day.
its fascinating how these overly political types just assume by default that everyone else ought to be as terminally online as them  to the point where anyone who disagrees with any talking points is clearly the worst-ever example of  the other side meanwhile  the majority of people are just moving on to watch something else because they dont want to be preached to about behavior that they dont even do. which somehow makes them guilty by association by default  I guess not sure how right wing incel types are supposed to be both not the real fans of gaming and so populous that calling them out is career suicide  but they re already engaging in enough mental gymnastics to fill a few circus rings  so whatever I guess.
and be shit on.  apparently we at g4 thought shitting in its viewers was a very good idea!  fight the power
dear melonie  I agreed with 96  of what you were saying.  but let me explain why representation matters.  as a woman  I am sure you  if not your mother or at worst your grandmother  heard how certain things were  men things   sports  ceos  military  and others  women things   caregivers   modeling  domestics .  this is used to keep people out of things.   son  if you want to work on an airplane  you are supposed to be the pilot not the stewardess.  its in the name  stewardess.   same principle with male nurses  female race drivers  black hockey players  I could go on.  when we get there  it wont matter  but sadly we are not so representation does matter and not just for narcissists.  besides that  I think your argument was well laid out.
there is still hope for you.10 as it is written  there is none righteous  no  not one   romans 3 10 you may think and say  Im a very good person  or  I always try to do good . all without Christ are equally wicked in the sight of the Lord. you could try to work your way to heaven by doing good works  but if you have committed 1 sin  you are guilty of breaking the whole law  james 2 10 .23 for all have sinned  and come short of the glory of God   romans 3 23 all people have sinned against a holy and righteous God. let me ask you this  do you admit that you have done wrong and committed sin  whenever we sin against God  we are guilty of thatsin s . 23 for the wages of sin is death  but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.  romans 6 23 there are consequences to our actions. every choice we make has a consequence whether it be good or bad. if a person dies without accepting Christ as his or her savior  thatsame person will wake up in hell awaiting the great white thrown judgment. all the unsaved will be thrown into the lake of fire after the great white throne judgment.8 but God commendeth his love toward us  in that  while we were yet sinners  Christ died for us.  romans 5 8 the lake of fire is a scary place. the good news is that there is a way to escape the lake of fire right now today.5 but he was wounded for our transgressions  he was bruised for our iniquities  the chastisement of our peace was upon him  and with his stripes we are healed.6 all we like sheep have gone astray  we have turned every one to his own way  and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.  isaiah 53 5-6 Jesus Christ was born of a virgin. he was beaten for you. he paid the price of your sins on the cross at calvary with his precious blood. his blood was shed for you  so that you have a chance to get saved from the lake of fire.16 for God so loved the world  that he gave his only begotten son  that whosoever believeth in him should not perish  but have everlasting life.17 for God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world  but that the world through him might be saved.  john 3 16-17 God cares about us. he loved us so much that he was willing to send Jesus Christ to die for us so that we dont have to spend eternity in the lake of fire.9 that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus  and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead  thou shalt be saved.10 for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness  and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.  romans 10 9-10 Jesus Christ died on the cross and was buried and on the 3rd day  he rose again from the dead. we all have a chance for salvation. God give us many chances to get saved. even though God is a righteous judge  he still loves us.13 for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.  romans 10 13 if you want to get saved  all you have to do is to admit that you are a sinner  believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and what he did for you    call upon his name with a humble  repentant  willing  and contrite heart sincerely  and he will save you from the lake of fire.get saved today  because you might not have another tomorrow. go to Jesus for he is merciful.28 come unto me  all ye that labour and are heavy laden  and I will give yourest.  matthew 11 28 4 and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes  and there shall be no more death  neither sorrow  nor crying  neither shall there be any more pain  for the former things are passed away.5 and he thatsat upon the throne said  behold  Imake all things new. and he said unto me  write  for these words are true and faithful.  revelation 21 4-5
theyre not here to be eyecandy  Imean theyre not here.
contempt for the audience...instead of gratitude.a smug unearned sense of superiority...instead of humility.ideological and political obsession masked with supposed moral or ethical  concerns ...instead of focusing on games  entertainment and content.regardless of the demographic or audience...very few people tolerate never mind enjoy...being lectured...preached at...and or insulted.
g4 go boom as well. boom
if incels is not enough then its right-wing-incels.  d how can people in 2022 not understand the internet  there will always be trolls  idiots and of course people with a different opinion than your own. there is no way a moderator or a host nowadays doesnt understand that. your job as a gaming host is to entertain people  actually know shit about gaming and not rant about identity politics or how you dont like that the  internet  doesnt find you attractive.
g4 forgot we live in the woke world. never should had hired frosk from the get go  her crazy rant sealed the company s fate
oh g4 is gone now ......hm I wonder why
the biggest disappointment of all for me is sessler. he s a fellow gen x and his antics are a stain on the generation.
I love woke on woke crime.
you know youre living in a delusional world when you think gamergate happened as early as 2012 instead of itstarting in 2014.
who would have seen that one coming...
this video was posted 8 minutes ago. already has 32 comments
I grew up liking the stuff boys like and never needed represented to enjoy it. even as a kid I hated it when a token woman was thrown in for representation reasons
@melonie mac go boom  and I hated the justice league s green lantern for the same reason.  representation shouldn t be vital to an individual s self worth   but by definition   it does speak to society as a whole.  without representation   the challenge of people entering certain domains is higher.  this is well documented.   lenny kravitz being told rock and roll is white music.  chyna being told wrestling  even fake wrestling  is for men.  males being told they shouldn t be nurses.  as long as there are people who say   you cant be a because you are b   representation will be needed.  which is sad but true.
the  good  people had plenty of time to speak out  they didn t. they all got what they deserved.
my comment to g4 going under   hahahahahahahahahahahaha!!!!
thats unfortunate
haha  puppies playing in the background.
did this channel replace the main one
of course they blame gamer gate!!!  they will never learn from their mistakes!!!!
g4 like from 15 years ago  I last saw that on an actual television  with cable. why would they think this would work  I didn t even know it was back...
thatsaid  I hope the genuine talent from the show actually finds a better place  preferably with a non-corporate partner. and not sessler.
g4tv  hang on  hang on  comcast. dont worry I speak these guys language.g4tv  league of legendsaudience  go on...g4tv  console gamingaudience  uh huh  Im listening...g4tv  sex...ism...in...gaming audience  you guys are going away for a long time
get woke  go broke
11 46 always stay here till the end for this ... melonie the airplane  hahaha!  dropping bombs  its so cute and funny.
...and the  facts  that their were  no  hottie s on the show.
go woke get broke
how long before the remaining annoyances of amber heard  rop  she-hulk  mcu  etc. self destruct
go woke..go broke. when will these individuals wake up  I used to love g4 man  gaming fun times!
06 44 the good book says  as a dog returns to its vomit  so a fool to his folly.there s your verse for the day.
well  they told me not to watch it...
the woke are serving some a-grade prime cope steak right there. delicious.
I d never heard of g4
thank God
youreap what you sown
live by cancel culture  die by cancel culture.
hopefully mankind never has to put up with the nonsense of frosk and sessler again.
bayanetta 3 issue is a big deal
I highly doubt lessons were learned. lol
for the algorithm.
frosk definitely ruined everything and they should ve fired her immediately
the  woke  is small. regular people just getting by and working hard are the majority.  companies need to realize that.
next time g4tv listen to your real fanbase.
so insulting fans doesnt work who would ve thunk it !
spot on
maybe if frosk was never hired in the first place g4 tv would still be running
is she on onlyfans
when politically correct means morally reprehensible.
frosk looks like that kid who made that cringey pok mon go song.
this is so fucking deserved
entitled babies cannot learn anything if they dont take accountability for their actions.
if you dont like it. dont watch it. peace! ok. I dont. I didn t. g day.
also known as  shooting oneself in the foot.
everyone is figuring out the  fly over  parts of the world dont share the same narrative.

also also known as  dont  where you eat.
the lesson was not learned.  the lesson will never be learned by those kinds of people.  narcissists are incapable of ever accepting accountability.
another example of going woke and going broke!!
gotta love how that guy considers being virulently sexist to be normal
froskbite!!

more to the point gamers not just want a respected opinion but also they will know when you are talking out your ass and haven t played a game. they want to watch other gamers because they understand what their talking about. you will absolutely fail with gamers if you are superficial.
go woke g4 go broke
nah I ll happily dance on their graves that guy s attitude proves they wont learn. wokeness is exactly why it died  regardless of how unaware these idiots are.its time to stop being nice these people are enemies.
I think gina should ve stayed around jkn instead of that echo chamber.
that frost is hard on the eyes yikes
peace!
I liked the original g4. end of statement.
love you
winter is coming
they said if you dont like it dont watch it.  we didn t... enjoy...
they told me not to watch  so I didn t.
lesson learned ahahahahah! I wish.
they didnt learn jack shit at all judging from that tweet youre reading in the video lmao
weird. what happened to reading comments and getting the daily verse
in a world with youtubers and streamers  what s the point of g4
still eats stick of butter
God I really hope comcast gets involved in gaming ....no gamer ever said. comcast should have stuck to what they do best....ripping people off on cable tv service.
the employees knew the woke cancer they were helping to spread. if youbstayed with the company after the frosk rant you deserve no sympathy.
frosk and adam weren t unknown cancer  I have zero sympathy for people who ignore warning signs for a paycheck
what s your dogs name
I dont think a new tv channel for anything is going to be profitable these days regardless of the politics going on behind the scenes.
how do I turn down the brightness
I hate to see good people let go but when politics  get in the mixed and trashing your fans on how you feel instead of talking about video games is disrespectful on their part so in 2022 you should have been a little nicer to the few fans and we could all get along  peace!
I haven t watched g4 since around 2006 2008.tina wood and morgan webb were hot.also  diane mizota.
the completionist his been useless after what he did to johntron
oh please the employees applauded frosk and deserve to lose their job. I will not feel bad for them in the least. I am too busy celebrating.
I have a radical idea  and I know its going to bother a few people  but please hear me out how about we keep politics out of freaking entertainment
shorts lol so they couldn t get peoples attention 8 seconds
wow you look so pretty hope youre having a great day
lessons wont be learned. if anything  I wouldn t be surprised if people like frosk and adam sessler somehow fall upwards.
lol  that guy didn t learn any lessons. I hope he enjoyed his food stamps. he better get used to cat food.
get woke go broke.well deserved.
az from heelvsbabyface recommended your channel...all good 5
ben shapiro s firm   the daily wire  is always looking for people......think there could be a fit for some of those g4 people
they had too much overhead to be authentic. they should have leaned into being a promotional conduit for nbc universal projects. g4 should have made themselves valuable to comcast.
melonie what s oppoinons on the yakuza games
and nothing of value was lost
nothing of value was lost
I wonder how snl had lasted so long. it hasn t good for at least 20 years.
peace .
good riddance! after everything they ve done  they dont deserve forgiveness. glad its gone. honestly  no one actually cares. why would they mention that its disappointing  no one who is anyone human doesnt care.

the problem from what I saw was the clip of that girl basically yelling at the people watching the channel and stuff it was just a defiant misguided feminist fake feminist angle and it just turned everybody off.
go woke and go broke. time and time again
I thought it was gone for good back when I stopped watching it back in 2012. zombie channel. lol
none of these clowns will learn a damn thing.
gina darling  she is toxic as hell too.
wait... attacking your fans isn t endearing  shocking!
and nothing of value was lost.
do you take collagen    do you use filters    girl  I heard you are mid 30 s.  so yeah... I dont want to simp to much much  but.. well whatever you are doing.. its working.
heh cya frosk
too bad so sad and we never heard anything from red dead online ever again.
I saw how he reply to you on twitter it was very rude and uncalled for Im sorry that happened to you
am Imissing something wat is dis g4
imagine being mad and saying the failure of g4 is because the audience didn t like it....well yeah thats how it works its called  entertainment  you have to actually entertain the audience you cant force them to like it
most of their audience are young me.  g4 proceeded to shame and bully all of them.  like accusing baking show watchers of being hungry.  make your bed and sleep
you sound so... familiar
there s no professionalism in allowing your employees to throw hissy fits like toxic teenagers while representing your brand.
there were no good people at g4.
and hire actual gamers
when we had g4 tech tv here in canada years ago we had shows we loved and it was great! none of this nonsence. just games and movies and fandom for the fans! all the fans. male  female  any colour  any nstionality  any religion  any hogwarts house... none of it mattered! seemed the only quarrel then was ps or xbox
youre gorgeous
nah sessler give that a negative 4 out of 5 lmao  begone
these people are like   tiger eats gazelle  its the fault of the right wingers!!!
gerard didnt need to be in thatshitshow anyway  hes way to nice a guy
this girls nails are always on point. .but I digress..but booo g4..you brought this on yourself
hazza!
can you please focus more on the puppy in the background.  more puppy please.
g4  gone 4ever
I honestly dont care about the people that lost their jobs. you stayed there meaning you stood by the words that were said. good riddance  Im tired of being called evil by people who project strawman arguments onto me  then want pitty when the reap what the sow. dont feel sorry for these people.
frosk looked like she never washed or brushed her hair  and chewed on dip tobacco.   looks are important in media.  she is jealous of pretty  straight females.
reminder that dehumanising language is one the final stages preceding genocide.
g4 was to be about games  everything we are talking about here has nothing to do with games.
poor poor snaggle tooth frosk just go away woke broke
sample number 154 233 of  go woke  go broke   people still haven t figured it out
haaahahaaahahahahaahahaa
comment for tomb raider  and happy thanksgiving
I feel bad for jirard
yeah dont alienate half your audience get woke go broke.
can marvel disney learn something maybe  what seems to generate the most income  catering to your fanbase or shitting on it
oh noooo. anyways
never watched g4  but be verry happy they re gone
play stupid games  win stupid prizes
nuts. I liked machine gun karen
dont talk about religion or politics at work has been a saying for a couple mins I think.
it failed because these fools didn t want an audience and this one proved he didn t know his competition. youtube shorts  are you serious  thats nonsense that no common sense person could argue but y all were on twitch so those weren t your competition those were your platforms!I dont even know why you said shorts instead of youtube because that would make more sense to say though not correct. ign and the video game news articles y all wanted to support you was your competition of course plus the internet gaming channels. good riddance g4 as this dude and many others with his attitude caused this brand to be dead forever. at least put some other stuff as the reason to cope instead of throwing 2 different things at the forefront so you wouldn t be upset.
omfg  that thumbnail  frosk is the personification of hotdog water.
how about g4 should have concentrated on games and nothing else. the games should have been the focus  not the host.
I dont think so. if it was a lesson learned all the companies would learn for the failures of others. but eveyone keeps doing the same thing that ruin every business.ceos are dumb.
neverhireactivists.
good riddance. haven t even given them a view in I dont know how many years. was honestly surprised to hear it was still around last year.
he s finally free from a terrible product and can focus on his much better content he made himself in his review and lp channel
same
@melonie mac go boom  dont worry melonie he s still got his completionist and super verd bros channels. he ll be fine after all. he s a strong guy
another  entertainment  venue that has contempt for its fans failing  huh  what a shock.
lets talk about our fee fees and barely mention games. not exactly a good business model for a game show.doomed from the start!
Im no lesbian but who would touch frusk
next time  dont lean so much on the  go woke or go broke  logic. and take care of your community and the true talent involved.
the over usage of the word incels doesnt help. alienating right wingers and calling them all incels is just a sure sign of insecurity  wow thats not a great business model
but the guy sounds like gen z  who have trouble with basic logic constructs.
g4 next time keep your politics outside of gaming.
that what happens when you bash your fan base and customers they need to learn by the hard way. and no it hasn t sink in there heads yet this what happens when you defend a feminist your company gose boom.
get woke go broke
here s to hoping some of their viewers migrate here. the host is not afraid to be feminine. the host is not afraid to be natural  as much as possible . wholesome Christian content from time to time... what s not to like  eh
isn t that becoming the standard response of women doing anything men aren t interested in
if the ship you are on is sinking you abandon it. the ship called g4 slammed into an iceberg called frosk and anybody who didn t jump off goes down with it. I have little sympathy for someone who ends up in trouble because they refuse to see the writing on the wall. they might be good people but they are not smart people. I stopped feeling sorry for stupid years ago. matthew 7 6 works just as well with secular matters as spiritual.
is frosk a dude  that thumbnail is sus.
froskaren
gaming is supposed to be gaming only for fun for escape then we found out some women like gaming so was welcome open arms then they tried to change it to the view that they want and started saying sexist misogyny get the f  k out of gaming with your politics... those people in g4 is ruining gaming for women and men who genuinely like gaming as it is....
k bye
frosk should be exiled to syria or iran
geez... put a shirt on woman...
this goes back to  just make good content and write good scripts.  stop trying to meet some imaginary diversity quota and satisfy minority sociopolitical expectations while expecting to be successful. its becoming a painful reality that this doesnt work in the long term.
I dont mean to come across shallow....but that photo of frosk is just......just awful!
this is what you get when you hire a bunch of woke activists.
I hate to tell these people but...  right wing incels  watch content  view ads  and potentially buy stuff too.  when you alienate a big chunk of your potential audience its not them who pay the price ultimately  its you when your job goes away because of lack of viewership.now if youre ok with being unemployed because of your ideology  well Im ok with that.
everything woke turns into shit
could they   yes!   will they   no lesson will be learned.
who
didn t like frost from day one. I really didn t like her smug attitude and terrible views. apparently my douche radar is very accurate
omg this is page is kinda gross lmao
I blame incels! projecting much
I wish james rolf avgn could have hosted g4. morgan webb and james rolf  instead we got the angry video game journalist and the angry video game feminist
what content is this tart making other than reading tweets with a pretty face and twangy voice
woke people insist they re righteous. if they would have fired frosk and possibly sessler I would have watched it..   was looking forward to this but couldn t take it.
insulting your customer base is so progressive.
xd xd xd trash comcast always making trash decisions. hope they go bankrupt- they deserve it with how they have treated their customers for years and years.
fyI  there is no such thing as an incel. its 100  voluntary. I can promise you that.
all they had to do was not inject their woke politics attack their own audience and they just couldn t help themselves.
this representation bs is for politics  there you vote and elect people who you think will represent you  not entertainment  for a games show  hire cool people who love games and dont talk about politics  their only job was to talk about games and yet they failed it. if they want to talk about politics  stop talking about games and create a channel about news and politics
the lesson you learned is  keep your politics  feminism  and beliefs  out of the workplace.
go woke  go broken.I really  cant  believe  humans  can  be  this  stupid  lol.I love  g4 as a kid  but  now it can  go to hell.
it was a stale  obsolete format anyway  even without the gamer-hating
completionist sorry big boy but you should ve stood up and said something as soon as frost urine finished that unhinged off the books rant. your silence was compliance and itsealed your fate. game over!
what s with all of the unnecessary spacing
@paul carmi  I just  like to do it because  I  am so bored
good riddance.  I never liked them  and this frosk nonsense made it even more so.
you dont mention  and none of you stoke-the-fire channels mention once how g4 was also on cable with a very low view count. you dont mention that that also had a hand in its cancellation. this channel  that fat guy from reviewtech and the quartering need to find legit things to discuss. its a shame people patronize this garbage.
just read this article.  was this frosk dude related to some super rich person   no logic in letting your whole network tank over one delusional machine gun kelly looking thing.
another business killed by a feminist !!! ...
they re not the sharpest tool in the shed obviosly  super dumb move!!!
good riddance. techtv was infinitely better.
good  the more woke dogshit ruins shit from my childhood  I certainly want it to fail but Im mad about the completionist. he doesnt do serve this.
that g4 was dead on launch that premiere was horrible and it just got worse.
get religion and politics out of gaming!! its our sacred sanctuary!!
please dont use woke buzzwords like  space . thats cringe af to use phrases like in this space.
they should ve kept their sjw crap out
people want to be entertained not lectured on politics or social justice  it isn t rocket science. the content was garbage.
meh. I dug it. glad it came back. Im too old to give af why a company folded or to cry like a bitch about something the on air talent said.
maga incels rejoice!
the network failed because the content was lame. game reviews for 2-5 year old games  that was enough to turn me away from the network. but also there s way too much competition online with much better content. frankly frosqs little outburst was ridiculous but its not the reason it failed.
appreciate your support towards my channel 
I was referring to gamers lol. just because some internet cry babies made up  safe space  doesnt mean we cant use the word  space  ever again. they cant steal words from us lol
@melonie mac go boom  tell that to gary getting upset over the word community lol
