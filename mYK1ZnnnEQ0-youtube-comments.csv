Ive said it before and I ll say it again  Im not going to put all my hopes on one guy. that being said  its objectively true that twitter is a terrible platform for both users and for shareholders. at this point any kind of shakeup would be great. Im convinced that the reason the other major shareholders dont want musk to take over is because they re more interested in using twitter to leverage political power than to actually make money. but if their refusal causes the stocks to drop  I guarantee you that lawsuits from the nonpartisan shareholders are forthcoming and twitter collapses. so basically its a win-win.
regardless of what elon s actual motive is  and I d like to believe that it is freedom of speech  does it matter  is there any way that he could make the platform worse than it is  make the power move  break some things and see what happens.
watching all the copium coming from the blue haired check marks is glorious. grab your popcorn boomers cause this is gonna be good.
elon has them by the balls. the board has a fiduciary duty to do what s in the best interests of the shareholders. a sale at a valuation of  54 per share is good for the shareholders. if elon sells his stock the share price will tank. the board would have an obligation to resign  and if they dont it would look very bad and they could be sued.
to david low who worried about starting keto.  I totally understand and was in the same position when I started keto a few years ago.  I spent a lot of time preparing for the day of starting keto and I ended up just making myself worry much more about it.once I went keto I realized   oh  this is really easy and I worried for nothing.    d   Im actually doing carnivore now which I prefer and find so much easier for me to stick to.   no need to measure amount of carbs  no need to worry about how much I eat or track anything.  I just eat beef  pork  eggs and have a little heavy cream in my coffee.   sometimes I ll have a little cheese or sour cream.  zero fruits or vegetables.   Im 52 and haven t felt this good since my mid 20 s.my 3 tips for getting started on keto or carnivore the easy way 1  dont get worried about the process.  buy a few pounds of bacon and a few dozen eggs.  cook the bacon in a pan  5 or 6 slices  and then cook the eggs in the bacon grease.  dont skip the fat.   if you have a lot of fat save it for other meals but use at least 1-2 tablespoons to cook your eggs in.  it tastes great  its good for you and its what keeps you satisfied so you dont east as often.you also can buy ground beef and make burger patties and maybe even add a little cheese.  some people have issues eating dairy like cheese or cream so go lightly with that to see how you do.   also feel free to use salt as you wish.  going keto carnivore quickly lets you drop water weight and makes it easy to consume higher amounts of salt than you could when eating carbs.2  buy an electrolyte supplement.  itshould at least have salt  sodium   magnesium and potassium.  many also include an assortment of vitamins and other minerals.  just make sure it doesnt have any sugars or carbs.  when you start keto carnivore you quickly lose a lot of water weight and that drains your electrolytes.  this can make you feel very weak  tired and need to sleep a lot.  for me it reminds me of having a bad hangover.  keep a few aspirin handy and drink your electrolyte drink and your body will adapt in a few days.3  the first week or two your body will be adjusting to the higher amount of animal fat you are eating and in some people it can cause very urgent  aka explosive  diarrhea.   keep very close to a bathroom during that time.  it may take a week or two for your body to fully adjust but once it does you are set!as I said  I also over thought the issue.  I read a lot about how your body actually changes from burning glucose for fuel to changing ketones for fuel.  its a more efficient and cleaner burning fuel.  I thought this was a scary difficult process but its really as easy as - just eating mostly meat eggs.its really as simple as eating bacon and eggs for your meal.  its also as easy as going to mcdonalds and asking to buy 4 quarter pound patties - no buns  ketchup or pickles.  you dont need to buy expensive grass fed beef and always cook at home.  just dont eat the high carb foods.the reason I stopped keto and moved to carnivore was just me being lazy.  I did not like having to keep track of how many carbs I had in my meals to know how much I could eat for my next meal.   I tried carnivore and realized we dont need vegetables or fruitso why eat them    if I dont eat carbs I dont have to count them.  best of luck making the switch david!
pretty cool power move on elon s part but if he truly is apart of some mastermind group Im curious as to his end game for buying twitter beyond saving free speech. should be interesting 5 or 10 years from now seeing how things shape up under his control.
well I was a fan of melonie s before  but Im a much bigger fan now. thank you so much  dear lady
I could watch listen to melanie read me the cheesecake factory menu
Im cautiously optimistic about elon acquiring twitter. I hope he acts like a bull in a china shop out of the gate then rebuilds the platform best he can. it cant get any worse  anyway  so the only way to go is up. also  woo! got a featured comment!
hImelanie Ive always had problems with standing up for myself over the years and it has become all consuming especially being a white male with seems to be a 4-letter word these days but after watching your videos I have been building up my own self esteem and make my opinions more known and when someone ticks me off I now give them an earful thanks melanie you rock you get a 5 star rating.
I just love watching how elon shakes up the twitterverse.  truly is a goat troll.  I appreciate the verses of the day.  the one the other day about being where we are needed really hit home.  may you continue to be blessed by God.
its a hell of a birthday present for me!I hope he owns it all!
so  let me get this straight you post at 9pm for me  I should note that down. but Im glad elon is buying twitter. twitter isn t evil  its the people who run twitter that are. there s too much censorship. even someone as harmless as brittany ventI is heavily censored  you cant even get a notification from her.  buytwitterelon
the blue check marks are so mad right now too.  this beings a smile to my face... lol
glad you are exposing the truth!
haven t seen the blue checkmarks this furious since a 17-year-old kid was chased down  shot at  attacked by at least 6 people on video  and defended himself with a legal firearm that never crossed state lines...
it will give you the craps.   I laughed so hard when you said that. youre so amazing. and may God continue to bless you. ttyl
its one thing to have fu money  but musk has  I can bury you money
hello melonie! have you done a video talking about why you enjoy twitter so much  the old version   like what about her character or the challenges stuff like that
this is a power move by musk. that is quite needed
Ive been on twitter for 13 years with no complaints....can you give me an idea of a specific change you would suggest
other major owners include the saudis and we all know how much they love free speech and open discussions!
@neutrino78x  no more arbitrary moderation where someone gets banned has posts removed for spurious reasons would be a good start. apart from that  twitter is in need of structural changes like making twitter blue more useful in order to get people to subscribe more. lastly  trending needs to be fixed so that its more organic and less curated  otherwise no one is going to take itseriously.
@spitshinesneakers  those things usually happen to people who deserved it  in my 13 years of experience with twitter.still  I feel like you didn t really answer my question.you support the terrorist attack on the capitol on january 6  do you support donald trump
@neutrino78x  I answered the question that you asked  which was  are youreferring to trump  and I said no. Im not getting dragged into an argument that I have nothing to do with.
@neutrino78x  dude  Im not here to argue politics  Im not even a registered voter  I dont have a dog in this fight. Im here to complain about twitter  nothing more. if you want to keep complaining about trump or whatever  go do itsomewhere else.
thnx for this post!
hope my advice helps  I believe in you
Im also fairly skeptical of musk  but he seems to be doing a lot of good things and twitter definitely needs a regime change
if I was a Christian  I would say youre doing God s work
hImelonie love your channel. great video
it d be amazing if he d be able to get it
wokeness  gives people a shield to be mean and cruel  armored in false virtue.  -elon musk
musk is just media savvy enough to avoid memes like  musk in the boardroom
go elon! I dont think these blue check marks know what the word  democracy  means. and I love correcting people thatsay we live in a  democracy . no... we live in a republic. democracy is our form of government. but its obvious that when these people cry out save our democracy  they are obviously crying out  save democrats .
good job  keep it  up.
to the commenter who asks if we feel if we walk with God  yes and by faith.  hebrews 11 6 . as for worrying about starting up keto  its easier than you think and even I worried at first. I lost 120 pounds years ago on it  back when it was atkins phase 1  though my body needed a change recently. I recommend planning out your meals  even if you dont prep . with elon  whether or not he buys it is a good thing. he s playing a power move for sure  but if they dont accept his offer he will have forced them to quite literally state they are against free speech.
exactly  he is one of them.nobody thrives in this system unless his one their club members.
I dont like most elites either. but elon seems to be stating things publicly that goes against the narratives that other elites are posting. so I do have more hope for him  even if I dont fully trust him yet.
this is a awesome move from elon and if he changes the name to titter it would be hilariously funny
I posted this somewhere else  but  it just more affirming that these people really  really have a dependency on twitter. and shows a problem with mental health and addiction in the computer age.
the way I see it its not like he could make twitter worse then what it already is  most of the people who use it do a pretty good job of making it a horribly toxic place filled with equally toxic people gotta remember this is a place that bans conservative ideals and people but let what was basically child porn flow throughout the app unchecked a while back. so far as Im concerned any place that lets something like that go on for as long as it did I ll happily watch burn to the ground   figuratively  I have no clue why he actually wants to take over twitter   maybe he s bored there s probably an ulterior motive    but like I said not like he could make it worse then what it is. but the way he s set this up is it ll end one of two ways.1  the board will accept the offeror2  the board will refuse the offer and he ll sell his stock and the share price will tank and it ll end with the board resigning or if they dont they ll be sued which will probably cause it to collapse.either way its an improvement over current twitter. and I like the daily Bible verse its nice seeing someone who s firm and unwavering in their faith on a platform like this as a Christian I can appreciate this  _
the question is  when he buys it  will he call it musker
the meltdown is hilarious
I bought a share of twitter today and musk is willing to buy a share for  56. I wonder if day traders will buy as much as they can before he buys.
the meltdown glorious! lol
do a report on how lootcrate isn t shipping peoples orders.
some things in live are inevitable. death...taxes...blue checkmarks crying.
well  isn t it a democratic republic  more specifically  so still a republic of course  but you know what Imean.
democracies never last.
its a bit of a risk. what if he doesnt buy and instead sells his current shares  the investors lose.
if they decline  elon should sell his shares than after his position is covered says something like  I tried to save twitter but it  s clear it will be a dead platform and they would rather shareholders lose money  so instead I am announcing a new company  insert name here    .
to be honest with you watching these individuals screech on twitter about a rich billionaire buying a company to fix the current state of the social media app. shows their true colors and is absolutely hilarious. lol
I think its too good to be true
I dont really care if twitter cease to bethe cesspool that it is or not  I dont use it at all  and I only see the shenanigans that ytubers. but seeing the usual fart sniffing blue checks having a mental breakdown and sweating profusely as the meme man makes the best monetary flex Ive ever seen is totally worth it. thank you  elon  for this amazing show of salt and tearsalso  look at thatshare price   54.20. the memes truly are the dna of the soul
Imight just buy google.
that frish seems incredibly wise. I agree with pretty much every point he made.
he could ve built his own platform.  he could ve boosted minds with massive investment.  whatever this is about  its not really about having a free speech platform.
I want elon musk to buy ubisoft paris I need a good ghost recon game melonie   _   _
Im living for this. anything to see the far left wokies reeeee all over the place  I left twitter some time ago after watching some artists I followed on there jump ship because they were accused of being racist. dunno what to think about mr. musk  myself. but I like his humor.
thank you you are the bomb
I am only worried about this because I think twitter would be a bad investment for musk.
elon musk is the greatest african american since mlk
can confirm magnesium helping with sleep!
elon never wanted to be on the board because he wouldn t be allowed to own majority stock. they offered him a place on the board to prevent him from owning too much stock. he turned it down
treat anxiety with physical action gad bless
hold on a minute.  when they say social matters experts  are they referring to the blue-haired land whale activists who identify as a cat or a transformer  depending on the day
I dont think elon is a puppet of the nwo  I like most of his takes  theirs only 1 thing that makes me suspicious of him and thats neurolink.
they said build your own platform  they did and amazon  google and apple blocked them. so know its your turn to build your own platform if you dont like it.
the presence of God is unlike anything you ve ever felt before or ever will feel
no Im not looking at your eyes Im looking at your tattoos
I too am a matt walsh fan. lol
@mike barton   love that guy.  relaying common sense with dry humor on a daily basis
he s white.
@neutrino78x  elon musk is from south africa.
@mike barton  african-american means one who is of an ethnicity originating in africa.elon musk is descended from britain not africa.your post is an example of  say youre a racist without saying youre a racist .
@neutrino78x  he was born and raised in africa that makes him african has nothing to do with skin color. where ever you are born thats what you are
@cloud ashmore  uh  no....its not. south african is his original nationality  its not his ethnicity or race.  african-american  means you are an american citizen of african descent. musk is an american of european descent therefore not an african-american.are you an american  I dont see how you d grow up here without knowing what  african-american  means and that it doesnt refer to white people.
@neutrino78x  never said anything about african-american
@cloud ashmore  read the original post to which we are all replying  by purple pill philosophy.
@neutrino78x  never replied to the original post I replied to you. I never said african-american. calling him african is correct because its where he s from. also they re not african-americans they re americans I dont look at black people as different or less than also elon musk is more africanthan  african-americans  thats crazy right seeing how  african-americans  never stepped foot in africa
50  of the video game customers are not female I d confidently say its more 80 20 spread with 80  males dominant. this person sorely underestimates gacha games. the amount of men in the gacha market is staggeringly high. it is also the last bastion for men of culture who appreciate the voluptuous female form and actually get it with minimal censorship only if it is exported to the western gaming sphere. yep sadly censorship has hit this market too. also women of culture are also welcome here we have husbandos for them too.
Im cautiously optimistic about elon s take-over. he can do a lot of good. on the same token  if successful  he may end up perpetuating many of the problems it currently already has  ending with a twitter thats going to survive much  much longer  but only marginally better - if better at all.also  the Christian community needs more people that dont have sticks shoved up their ass to speak out. as much as I disagree with a lot of it  Christianity doesnt have to be the evil villain the left thinks it is. and to be honest  I put responsibility for the current disaster the left is squarely on the Christian right. many  including myself  grew up watching the religious ban pokemon  censor music  and absolutely freak out over two-piece bikinis. the modern left is  in many ways  a massive overreaction to the Christian right s flaws.
Ive been a nurse for 12 years. watch out when loading up on magnesium before talking to a pcp. magnesium affects the heart.
wow. its like the wokies get hit on their own territory... finally some justice for them invading the game territory
woo  dis gon  make the government big mad
I love the about face we re seeing from the woke pro-censorship crowd.  its a private company ....lol
the less people are allowed to say  the more fragile society becomes  proof   look at twitter now do it elon  it will fix a lot of weakness
glad I stay off twitter social media is harmful
I dont trust elon or any billionaire  in that fact...
cool video melonie . anyways when more but pics on twitter
I love how random dude disputes the  gamers are mainly males  statement made by melonie  someone with more than a decade of game related content hosting on actual gaming networks. nice try. now move along.
I d love to meet a 30 something girl who likes video games and knows Jesus is the only way to salvation. being alone is not that bad I guess. lol elon wants to chip brains so Im not that cool with him.
threats  call for violence  or doxing are all thatshould not be allowed
disagree. twitter should not be a private company. private ownership is the reason it is a complete failure. itshould be publicly owned and function as a utility where all people are free to participate. if musk really intends to prioritize free speech on twitter  this remains to be seen   I do agree with the objective. however  the free status of twitter-as-public-square should not depend on the whims on an eccentric billionaire.
elon is a total chad!
twitter is the mos eisley of the internet.
I wished you a happy good friday. God is good. God bless you
def a bond villain lamo.
my life is going well  there is a God.  my life is going bad  there is no God. you tend to hear the first statement more but thats probably because one must be sufficiently healthy and wealthy to have a voice. ive always had thatsneaking suspicion that the only reason we hear well of God so often is because we re hearing from the already well off. if a person was born to a drug addict and lives off the streets  you dont hear their say in this. we get on platforms where celebrities and influencers thrive and  itshould be no surprise they report prayers are answered  not ignored. a crack baby would be singing a different tune but in silence. out of sight  out of mind. something to think about.
elon musk is a chad  he made an offer.................................................of what kind  alsoo thatstarlink system he gave to zelensky is tha bomb!
and to the gentlemen concerned about anxiety on keto. it ll be rough the first two weeks but you can get through it. you got this.
zelensky the criminal
@dying rose  elon and volodimyr are on the bestest terms  how else do you think there is internet in ukraine and tmobile telephone trafick.
@ngc  eitherway  its good.  starlink also made the news last week after ukraine s president volodymyr zelensky asked for starlink internet terminals to be sent as ukraine s broadband infrastructure was damaged in russian attacks. as well as being able to work in any areas where there is a clear view of the sky and not dependent on ground base infrastructure  apart from somewhere to mount the dish  president zelensky has also commented thatstarlink is the only non-russian communications system still working in some parts of ukraine in the wake of russia s invasion. elon musk  who communicated personally with president zelensky  has now donated starlink satellite internet terminals to the embattled country.
@cornelius antonius  I dont doubt that  but what Im saying is zelensky is not mr. paragon here. he is as corrupt as they come  not someone to be backed or looked up to as a hero.
@cornelius antonius  its a lie to say he donated the terminals though if someone paid for them and their delivery.and the initial tweet was from a minister  not zelensky  wasn t it
@ngc  putin s flagship named after moscow just sank.
@ngc  heey any wich way  they have internet. guess who ownes spacex   washington  usaid pr    the united states agency for international development  usaid  has delivered 5 000 starlink terminals to the government of ukraine through a public-private partnership with the american aerospace manufacturer  spacex.
@cornelius antonius  are you stoned  why mention the moskva and you just sound high af
on austinm1018 s comment  than you to for being openly religious  the only people I know who are openly religious by me were crappy people and or beat their kids  and most interaction with religious people tends to be when they want my entertainment gone  Im not going to be going into a church any time soon but its nice to see non crappy religious people for a change.
Im here to eat popcorn.

looking great melanie
I never understood  its a way of saying because I actually understand!  why cute or even beautiful women and men feel the need to get those horrible tattoos! many are at the third world prison level! if youre still destroy your skin perfection  at least get some better tattoos  not horrible ones!
keto can work for some people. its very helpful for diabetics. but its like veganism. you will run in to issues and side effects and you have to take measures to counter them. it did not work for me. but if you want to lose weight. litterly pick a simple list of healthy things you like. eat  4 small meals and 3 snacks a day. meals around 200-400 kcal snacks around 50-100 kcal. covering carbs fat protine and dairy. eat the same dam thing every day for a few months and exercise. you will melt your weight away. I recommend playing vr games like beatsabre or boxing games for 1hr a day and boom.
so elon musk want to buy twitter  why get mad  Imet him personally and is a cool but intense human being. I did ask about the underground facility under space x he did not respond just smiled. either way if it happens it happens lol!!
good morning and good afternoon melonie. anyway I just want to tell you and say that elon musk wants to be rich and powerful like bill gates and other rich people in the world who has alot of money in their pockets and wants to buy social media networks and new billions of dollars expensive things like other rich people has already and has done over the years and so that is why elon musk wants to buy twitter and other social media networks to be rich and powerful like other rich people  ok melonie. anyway I just want to tell you that and let you know what I think bout elon musk buying twitter network  ok melonie. anyway I hope you have a wonderful and great blessed day today at the gym and I hope you have a wonderful and great blessed day today and evening at home with your pets and have a good night too  ok melonie.
but its the story of an african american fighting the big tech overLords. the us media would usually celebrate such a story
musk doesnt have that much money at hand.
nice .  love you
elon is a based african american
hey melonie have you noticed that google has no reference to good friday today. disgusting...
musk is not a boomer... yet.
the craps lolololo
I have such a hard time watching melonies vids   if I look at her eyes too long the need to simp grows expedintielly so Imust limit my exposure unfortunately
aged bad
I think its a bit racist of the wokies having a problem with an african american running a major social media company.
665 like! I beat the devil!
we want the trump back
@ngc  yes  even the russians admit that is sank.
@cornelius antonius  I have no idea why your telling me that.when did we mention the moskva
@ngc  because I felt like it.
with extremely rare exception  there s no reason why keto cant work for the majority of people as it is a very primal way of eating. also quite simple science. the only essential macros are protein and fat  carbs are nonessential. keto removes the unessential macro  our bodies create all the glucose we need through gluconeogenesis. also calories are not everything  and 4 meals a day is absolutely terrible advice for insulin response alone.moreover  there is so much more to health than simply weight loss. cico alone creates a lot of unhealthy skinny-fat people.
@melonie mac go boom  keto can causes so many issues. brain fog. confusion. tirednes. pins and needles in your limbs. heart palpitations just to name a few and there is an endless list of counters to  mitigate them . not to mention the constant obsession to stay in ketosis. for pure weightloss its kcal in vs kcal out. 4 small meals keeps your metabolism active. insulin response is irrelevant if your not doing keto. I lost 98lb. from just controlling kcal and eating small but frequently throughout the day. after I quit doing keto. keto really did make me ill. I even followed the advice. got the calcium and magnesium tablets. adding salt. broth drinks etc etc. Im not saying keto is bad or that it wont work for everyone. but having been there and then going on to loose weight. alot of it. I have my scepticism.
