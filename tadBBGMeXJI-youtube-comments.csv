as a Christian pastor  it is great to hear someone from the pop-culture world comment on these matters. great job!
if one thinks the almighty creator of the universe shares their political views  they just might be worshiping themselves.  if one associates Jesus with the pride flag or maga hat  they ve officially lost the plot
Im not a Christian  but I have noticed this and Im disgusted by it.
drinking beer is easy. trashing your hotel room is easy. but being a Christian  thats a tough call. thats real rebellion. - alice cooper
take a seat. youre going to church today   absolutely true. the apostasy in the church is growing rapidly with the push of progressive ideals.
mel. what an awesome sermon  you hit it out of the park. more of this please! if youre shooting from the hip then God has blessed you with a talent for preaching! have you thought about speaking at other churches  God has put you in a privileged position to spread his word. God bless
sorry to hear this about your church  but let me say this - props to you for addressing it with this video  and I think you should make more videos like this.
I dont normally comment on videos  but I just wanted to say thank you for being awesome and covering this topic. as a person who still feels young in his walk with God  seeing people like you speak up on this topic fills me with hope. I was in an episcopal church that was pretty much liberal ideology   light Christianity that had me super confused. I grew up in church  became an atheist  then came back tor the faith. sitting in that church I knew something wasn t right  so we left. couldn t be happier with my current church.
Jesus loved everyone  he sat and befriended sinners.  yes  but he never enabled them to sin.
Im here for chuch melonie. youre right  Jesus isn t left or right. but definitely wasn t woke. people need to awake to what Jesus was and is teaching us. I love the verses you chose. spot on. no youre not crazy  I too believe satan is behind a lot of this stuff. the woke movement is of the world not of God. dont you just love when they take the word out of context to fit their narrative. I love this video. great video  great message. I hope God blesses this video. go boom
mel  I will say  its nice to find a fellow geek who is a Christian!  the issues you discussed in this video are making it hard to find a good  word  church  especially after the covid lockdowns.  it is my believe that this  woke  Christianity is part of the great apostasy that was prophesied about in the word.  you can look at this period of time as one that makes those of us that are saved even more obvious to everyone.  keep up the good work!  I hope to meet you in heaven!
first off  thank you for standing up and staying something.second  my family and I just left our church of over 20 years because of the same issues. there are lots of churches out there that are still living in the word  rather than conforming to culture. for us it didnt take long to find a real church  im sure you can find one pretty fast! I am not sure where you are from  but you are welcome at my church if you are in the oc area.
hat off to you! it takes a lot of faith and courage to make a video like this one  especially in this day and age. respect!
thank you  my daughters are about your age and they are totally woke and I dont exactly know what to do about it.  your voice helps many people.  keep it up.
spot on. I am personally tired of the polarization that politics are unfortunately causing. as a fellow Christian geek  I feel this cuts to the heart of the matter  especially from this type of platform. love the encouragement and inspiration
melanie  as a retired old military misfit who came to Christ way back in 1981  I was encouraged to hear you share your faith in Christ Jesus today.  seeing young people stand up for the God of the Bible makes my spiritsoar.  continue to share the word and never compromise.  Jesus ain t woke  he is the way  and the truth and the life.  preach itsister!
just wanted to mention I enjoy your content and its great to see someone who s so passionate in their commitment to God  especially as it becomes increasingly rare in today s world.
satan disguise himself as an angel of light  reminded be of an old say  that took me a while to understand   road to hell is paved with good intentions
melonie  well said! I appreciate how you handled the Bible passages and explained them. this is a much needed message and you addressed it well. thank you.
I found your channel through tomb raider  but honestly I love your content more than ever. Im quite meek and I dont speak my mind in person  so youre strong in my eyes. I have had Jesus in my life for as long as I can remember and Ive always loved my Lord  however I only considered myself as actually getting saved  recently  as an adult  when I truly understood what giving my soul meant. for that reason  I feel quite young  in my walk still and want to keep learning. your content shows me I can be young and still devout. and if I am devout in my Bible and God  then maybe I can even be a strong person too. maybe I could even be strong enough to do something powerful for God  just like you are now. God bless you and keep going boom  melonie.
thank you. God bless
amen!
exactly. they re literally breaking the first commandment and putting other  Gods  before God.
exactly and thats why I always say Christian first american conservative second. Jesus is first and I choose him over any human and political party. Jesus isn t political and libs doing this to Christianity is actually sad but God does say in the Bible the church will be ruined from inside  not the exact words but idk the exact book  chapter and verse . its sad to watch but its happening
@shaqoats  you mention the libs doing this  but you dont mention conservatives doing this. the quote about fascism coming to america wrapped in a flag describes the right perfectly  since you far more often see them co-opting God for their side  and give God as the reason for trying to enact authoritarian laws. Im not saying the libs doing it is better  but if youre going to call out one side  you need to be willing to call out the other  and this lack thereof is very telling.
@ian snow  okay  where are you seeing that  and define  authoritarian . laws you dont like are not necessarily authoritarian. youre going to have to give examples  because off the top of my head I cant think of a single thing the right has done that would be legitimately authoritarian while I could name dozens of things the left has done just in the past few months.
absolutely. this is why I cant stand politics and choose not to engage with it.
or its a metaphor using the popular mythology of the area...
@raven cyanide   the book  Jesus and john wayne  touches on thatsorta thing
conservatives have been doing this for more tha 100 years.
Christianity isn t rebellion it is being a sheep to a  good shepherd  even though that while shepherds fear the wolves it is the shepherd who 9 times out of 10 eats the sheep. Imean Christianity s morality is based in absolute submission and obedience to divine command rather than virtue  good works or wisdom. in fact Christianity s immoral nature is because the religion bases salvation on faith aka blind obedience to divine command instead of virtue  good works  wisdom etc. Imean in this cult man gaining wisdom was our  original sin.
@maria avalon  thank you for proving the point.
@krazygoodmods  Imean being a rebel is not a virtue in Christianity being an obedience submissive slave to this divine being is. which being a rebel isn t a virtue in and of itself. rebellion against an evil authority is a good thing but rebellion against a good authority is evil. Christianity is in essence being a sheep to a shepherd as the Bible states it is you all being sheep.
@maria avalon  isn t alice cooper a Christian though  in a fallen world  one could say that Christianity is rebellion. have you heard lecrae s song called  rebel   in a fallen world where the God of this world is satan  we rebel against him by surrendering our lives to the Lord Christ Jesus  God the son in the trinity.when people say rebel these days  they immediately think delinquents. rebels are people who are in opposition of a rulership. isn t it true to say thatsatan is leader of a rulership of some kind
@thegravityshifter  whether alice cooper is a Christian though means nothing. in fact if Christianity ruled this society and we were a theocracy then he would never be allowed to sing his type of music.also how are you  rebelling  against authority by exchanging one authority of satan to the authority of Jesus. in essence you are choosing to be a sheep to a  good shepherd  Jesus even though while you fear the wolf satan it is the shepherd who 9 times out of 10 eats the sheep.if you were truly of a spirit of rebellion you would rebel against both satan and Jesus. in fact what Jesus and his father wants is you to be submissive slaves. after all it was man gaining forbidden knowledge that was the original sin. really even though Christians believe satan fell that is honestly a false flag as satan is pretty much doing Jesus s commands for him by torturing Jesus s enemies that wont worship him. satan is pretty much just the guy who runs Jesus s fiery gulag. Imean what sense does it make to torture your enemy s enemies. satan is just your God s hangman and the hangman works for the king. so the fall of satan is a Christian false flag and fake news.likewise in Christianity if this God is all knowing there is no free will to rebel as our actions  thoughts and fates are all ready known by this God as is his thoughts  actions and decisions as well. so we nor your God have free will to rebel but in our cases are just sim programs made by the tyrannical computer of your God.which I dont think that rebellion is always good. rebellion against an evil authority like yahweh  Jesus and satan is good. rebellion against good authoritities like the queen of heaven and the good and rewarding Gods is not.
@maria avalon  youre either a slave to sin or to righteousness. there is no world we can live in where youre not a slave to something. we are made free in Christ. have you heard of the case where a slave turns to his master and then is set free by said master because the love is so strong  thats the analogy used in surrendering yourself to Christ.if yourebel against satan and God  therefore serving yourself  you are doing exactly what satan wants  therefore youre serving satan whether you like it or not. you think when the devil convinced adam and eve to rebel against God s command that it was in service to satan  he encouraged adam and eve to serve themselves as youre trying to encourage right now. the whole entire point of satan getting adam and eve to eat the forbidden fruit was to encourage them to choose for themselves instead of trusting God. it was a choice  as youre making when rebelling against God and satan.
@thegravityshifter  that is nonsense you say that we have to be a slave to something and then say that if you become Jesus s slave he will free you those are contradictions. you could never become a slave to anyone and even in Christianity if you are Jesus s slave you are his slave forever and must always obey him. so by your own logic I can serve Jesus and once he frees me I can reject his authority and no longer serve him  again your ideas make no sensealso that is nonsense if yourebel against Jesus and satan you serve neither and I hate and rebuke both. besides in your faith satan rebelled and got his own real hell. so why cant someone rebel against both Jesus and satan and get their own spiritual realm outside of heaven or hell.which again this shows your ideology your religion is spiritual slavery because the first sin was man gaining forbidden knowledge and not being an obedient slave to your God. plus by making the idea you can only serve Jesus or satan you do realize you are making satan into Jesus s equal. if satan can rebel and get his own realm and power and not serve Jesus I can rebel against Jesus and satan and not serve either because they are both evil and honestly satan s rebellion is a false flag as he is basically Jesus s gulag hell warden.no you can free yourself and not be either Jesus or satan s slave and say fuck you to both as really they are both monsters who want you to be their slaves instead of a free person. though you show in your faith it is impossible to be a true  rebel  as in your faith all humans are born to be slaves. really if your God is all knowing there is no choice of Jesus or satan as our slave masters as this choice is all ready known and predetermined by this God and he know what choice we would make when he created us. really your religion is more like a lovecraftian cult then a good moral religion. in fact moral and virtue dosen t exist in your religion rather blind obedience to your slave master.
@maria avalon  clearly we aren t getting anywhere and I really cant be asked to continue. if you wanna believe in that nonsense  fine. at least I know where you stand. as for me  I ll just agree to disagree and move on.
@maria avalon  obedience to God is rebellion to the world and the self.it is true that Christianity presumes the existence and presence of an eternal  infinite God. by definition  the knowledge and wisdom possessed by an infinite being would make our knowledge look like ignorance  but God isn t interested in blind followers. he calls to  taste and see that the Lord is good.   come let us reason together.  Jesus came that we might that we might know God  hence his title immanuel--God with us. he wants us to know him like we know any other person--to follow him like a soldier follows a general   like an explorer follows a guide  like a student follows a mentor  like a knight follows a king. not blindly  but with eyes a-light.if you dont want in the kingdom  no one is forcing you. but we dont believe in the God you dont believe in.
@mathew d. rhys  and again it is self inflicted slavery yourebel agains  the world and self  to be a slave to your God. a sheep to a shepherd. plus anyone who would wish to  rebel against theirselves  must be a self hating masochist.also he does want blind obedience. he wants people to do what he asks no matter whether it is evil or not and gives salvation based on blind belief not on good works and just because he has knowledge dosen t make him good. in fact he can be all knowing on matters and even know more then we do on certain things as I think that he like all Gods are but still be evil.also a student can disagree and fall away from a mentor and choose a different course of action without their mentor throwing them into a fiery gulag. once more as I said before if your God is allegedly all knowing and knows our ultimate fate and his own actions beforehand then free will dosen t exist rather our fates are detemined before hand as is his and we are just his sim pieces and he a computer program.any religion that demands yourebel against yourself is  cult. a religion for masochists and cucks. because if you have self respect you dont tolerate certain things from men  Gods or other beings and you know morality and virtue.again like I said before rebellion is neither good nor evil but you all aren t rebels. you are just choosing to be obedient slaves and cucks to your God. rejecting your self worth to be a sheep to a  good shepherd  fearing the wolves even though 9 times out of 10 it is the shepherd that eats the sheep not the wolves.also I do believe in your God btw I just know he is evil. many pagans believe in your God historically and presently and identified him with many malevolent deities as they did your satan as well. we regard both as evil.
@maria avalon  can you be wrong  or are you inerrant
@mathew d. rhys  anyone can be wrong however the facts and truth are never wrong. though your God is wrong about many things both morally  ethically etc. in fact the Bible like the quran is very historically and scientifically inaccurate. point in the fact in the Bible your God even expresses regret for wrong actions he has committed which again shows that even if he says he is all knowing he is not as all knowing and all good beings and no the 2 are not mutually inclusive do not experience regret as they do no wrong actions that cause them to experience regret.which yes I can be wrong and your God certainly is wrong. though I certainly have no committed the atrocities that he claims to have committed or commanded in his books honestly most humans are more moral then your God it dosen t take much. most animals too.
@maria avalon  how can you know when you are wrong
@mathew d. rhys  who says I am wrong. I am right on many things as your God is wrong on many things and he even experiences regret for wrong actions he has committed. truth btw is never wrong. the facts are no respecter of persons and if you can understand and reason truth you can understand morality. which if abrahamics have no rubric to reason and determine what is good  moral  right and truthful then they have no mechanism by which to determine whether their God is moral. all they have is blind obedience to divine command.
@maria avalon  that didn t answer my question. how can you know when you are wrong
@mathew d. rhys  what do you assume I am wrong on  because I like any person am able to understand truth and if I have a wrong belief correct it with evidence. plus why do you assume I am wrong when I can just as much say I am right. also right or wrong about what matter  abrahamics are so simplistic in their thinking. then again when you have an ideology of absolute good vs. absolute evil right there you are just dealing with the religious equivalent of borderline personality disorder splitting
@maria avalon  I am not asserting you are wrong about anything. I am asking you how you would know if you were wrong.
@thegravityshifter  thinking inside this frameset is what actually makes you a slave to something. you could have said that either you are the devils slave by acting how it wants you to act or that the devil is your slave by wanting you to act how you want to act  yet you chose to state it the first way. its about perspective  done right  true freedom is being only slaves to ourselves.
@doctor profesor  yes because its true. everyone has a master they follow. money  celebrities  collecting  sin  righteousness  name it  its followed like a slave to its master.let s put this in a different way. one could argue being on satan s side is more of a technical statement rather than a real one. you can either deliberately side with satan  or you canthrough action without knowing since generally this crowd wouldn t believe he exists.adam and eve didn t sin because they chose satan s side. they sinned because they were tempted to decide to know good and evil for themselves rather than trusting God s take on it. sin is inherently selfish. anytime you sin  its always going to be for yourself. name one sin that isn t selfish in nature. the reason I say its technically being on satan s side is because this means youre rebelling against God  which is what he wants. it doesnt matter what you believe  think  say or do. if you are rejecting God  you are doing the will of satan whether you know it or not  whether you like it or not. until you can convince me there is a way to sin without it being an act of satan s will  I have no reason to believe it.
@mathew d. rhys  thats what you think about yourself.
thats the dumbest quote Ive ever seen lmao you unironically typed that out lloooollll
@maria avalon  not all Christians hate rock music or sex etc. that is mostly Christians and jehovah witnesses. church of england were the ones who introduced divorce. catholics want people to be married for an eternity despite not lobing one another.  Christianity  is not just one thing that everyone obeys. perhaps you bad experiences with religion but others have benefited from it. not everyone blindly follows stuff. they can gain new perspective on things and sort their lives out for the better. people can believe in stuff without follow a specific religion. Im not sure where the view of religion as a strict thing where the religous whipped themselves with a belt everytime they sin. thatsounds like a hollywood type scenario or anime where the templars whip themselves and randomly kill innocents. exaggeration of stuff that almost never happens. you might get some who do that but that means nothing to the religious ones who are just living their lives normally. I have seen plenty of atheists who preach as if they have their religion.
@nemesis the slasher    catholics want people to be married for an eternity despite not lobing one another. resident agnostic dropping by to let you know that this is an absolutely ridiculous extrapolation  the intent is to place more value on love itself and the decision to wed in the first place.  if youre in a loveless marriage  I ll grant you its a coinflip  its literally your fault for ending up there and to blame catholicism for trying to promote thinking about your potential mistakes before you make them says more about yourself.
mmmmaaaaaaaaannn
true that!
thats why I love orthodoxy. the orthodox church just outright rejects all of this insanity.
her father should be very proud  and our father above.
the Bible doesnt allow women to teach openly in congregations  but I think some churches differ on the right interpretation of those passages. my congregation goes with the literal understanding and forbids women from teaching in church. I dont consider what mel did her a  sermon   because her viewers haven t gathered here as a church and from what I understand  she never implied this was a sermon of any sort.
wow I never heard this side of tim allen.  in all seriousness I hope God continues to reveal himself to you!
plus ultra!
Im curious  what church is it
he did though ..... he wasnt there to stop them from sinning as that wasnt his job on earth he died for your sins so you may reach heaven he didnt walk about thwacking naughty people with a ruler and shouting  stop that
@icravethevoid   exactly. as children of God  we shouldn t live in too much overt sin. but sin is transgression of God s law so when other people tell you to  stop sinning  they re telling you to keep God s law.but Christ is the end of the law for righteousness.Jesus didn t come to make  bad  people  good . he came to make dead people alive.
@daniel reynolds  no they are giving you an order which is something Jesus didnt do he actively assisted sinners at times in the stories actually which does enable them to continue sinning as he never stopped them only suggesting as much in words
@icravethevoid   oh I think we are in agreement on much . they are imposing their own religious dogma.Jesus did technically give commandments though  he just doesnt treat them the way a dictator would.matthew 22 37-39 is where Jesus gives his two commandments to love God with all you heart  mind  soul  and strength and to love one another. verse 40 of the same chapter is where its proclaimed that on these two commandments rests the whole of the law.the difference is that Jesus fulfills the law on our behalf and gives us his righteousness as a free gift so long as we believe on  trust in  him and what he did at the cross having purged our sins  and he now sits at the right hand of the majesty on high  and given us eternal life.
@icravethevoid   the thing most Christians get wrong is that they think turning from sin is a condition for salvation. its not. nobody has ever done it. he just told the woman caught in adultery to go and  sin no more - not because he actually thought she could live a sinless life  but rather if she kept doing it  he may not be there the next time she gets caught to save her from the mob.it is true though that God desires us to live Godly so that he can bless us  bring others to the gospel  and so we can build our own treasures in heaven.but not as a condition for salvation . thats by God s grace alone and is a free gift.
no you are crazy if you believe in an imaginary being.
Im not defending progressives in regard to this topic and there are Christians that do good without the use of the Bible or going to church  listen to what your saying though   using the word out of context to fit the narrative  just because you go to church  read the Bible  pray every day and ask for forgiveness or go to a priest when you have done something wrong doesnt mean you are automatically free of that wrong doing  watch dante s inferno and you will understand what Imean. Christianity in general has always taken what you call the word out of context to fit its own narrative  salem and the so called holy wars are just two examples of that  religion is centered around centuries of broken telephone  no one knows what really happened back than  the Bible is basically a translation of stone tablets thats been carved by man there s no real evidence that it was written by a devine hand. in all honesty I respect your belief  I wont go judging you for it  to me its more the choices you make. the religion your in  the book youread  your faith in the long run that doesnt matter  as long as it matters to you yourself and it helps you make the right choices thats what counts  doesnt mean everyone has to follow along.
satan isn t making anything happen and its kind of removing agency from people. people make a choice and their pride wont let them change it. envy creates the lust that makes us do insane things to satisfy it  greed makes us justify it  which leads you to gluttony and sloth which of course leads you to wrath where you attack everyone who took something from you or tried to. all of those things are simple emotions which can be used for good  let me explain. pride can be used to believe in yourself to pursue your dreams  envy shows you what you want for yourself be it a bigger house or better car  lust makes makes you pursue what you want in a spouse  greed always makes you push yourself farther then the next guy or girl. gluttony is a reward you give yourself like good food and a lot of drinks  slothness is also a reward you give yourself by forcing you to stop and relax to take stock. wrath is the one people always think there is no positive outcome for wrath  I say if you were infuriated by a political party your  wrath  can drive you to change it for the better or make sure that person isn t elected. if you want to be successful in anything you better be using a little of these 7 deadly sins  because following arbitrary rules and believing in sunshine and rainbows isn t going to get it done. you decide not some fallen son of some all knowing deity. yes these are known as the seven deadly sins and you could connect it to satan or the devil or whatever but imo at the end of day you need choose what you do  not remove your own agency.
@tarn 113  it is both satan and people s own hardness of heart. satan will use people s sinful nature. by the way satan was an fallen angel and not a son of God.
@victor lugosi  no satan is a specific term for a entity from the abrahamic religions. in the Christian context it is the leader of the fallen angels of hell. in judaism satan isn t considered evil but a angel that works for yahweh as mainstream judaism denies the existence of fallen angels  in islam satan is a djinn and in yazidI faith satan aka melek taus is the leader of angels and works for yahweh allah.also which statues do  elite liberals pray to  because many are atheists or wishy washing Christians. also I would say thatsatan just like yahweh allah and Jesus are all evil which is why many pagans identified them with malevolent deities.
thatsaying  while valuable  is quite a bit different. satan knowingly used scripture to pretend to be virtuous in his temptations. but the  good intentions  that pave the road to hell specifically refers to people who are blind to good  who think they are doing good. they dont mean to create a worse world  but they aren t willing to face the fact that maybe  just maybe  their best-of-intentions might have been harmful  and not helpful.you think youre helping your friend by not telling him to put down the cupcake  thus sparing him from the momentary discomfort of shame  but youre actually hurting him by allowing his diabetes to progress  and eventually lose a kidney and a foot to his condition  because you  had good intentions . you didn t want him to get more sick  but you placed the short-term comforts of feelings over the long-term good of health and well-being.you pretend to be helping your rival by giving him suggestions on how to jump start his day more productively  when in actuality you know its a suggestion that will burn him out and cause him frustration and possibly discourage him and get him to temporarily quit  all so you cantake advantage of his slump and get ahead of him. you didn t actually want your competition to improve  you just lied so you could get an edge ahead of them.see the difference
awww! this comment really blessed my heart  what a beautiful testimony. you definitely have a heart for the Lord  and I know that has to make him very happy
I just found your channel and Im glad I did. this video is a great one. I see many youtubers talking about woke garbage in tv and movies but never talking about the word of God. you brought it all together very very well. thank you. I ll definitely be watching you videos. keep up the great truthful message.
I came here after seeing you livestream with critical drinker today and was intrigued by this video. very well done and you make some great points. I think this is a call for all Christians to dig deeper into their Bibles and keep a closer watch on their church. our churches will only fall into heresy if we allow them. Im subscribing and going through past videos for more gems like this.
wow. tough truth  compassionate love  and biblical support being used in accurate context. well done!
I left my church of 52 years for these very reasons. it was one of the hardest things I have ever done. that church and its members were my support group that guided me through some difficult times. and they celebrated my family s successes. leaving was not easy. but it was warranted. watching a previously conservative church go  woke  with new pastors was surreal. my relationship to Christ improved immediately upon leaving. it was hard but Im glad I did. you outlined my thoughts precisely.
melonie youre not crazy  youre an intelligent woman. God bless you !
thank you so much for speaking the truth melonie your voice really does matter no matter what people say dont give up doing what youre doing  stay strong  love your content. God bless
excellent video  melonie. you bring to light a great shadow that has fallen over the church in recent years  and the church in all its forms. used to be I thought certain denominations would be safe from the corrupting influence of social justice and progressive philosophy  but that is no longer the case in either thought or practice. no church is truly safe from this influence  and it will take pastors and parishioners both working together to keep worldly influence outside of the walls of the church and--more importantly--outside of our hearts and souls.the problem is too many parishioners are ignorant of this  and too many pastors and theologians are either ignorant or complicit. its a dangerous time for the church  but fear not. God is with us  and he has carried his church through far worse than the age we re currently living through. he will carry us through this  as well  but we must do our part as well.thank you for this video  and for taking a stand  melonie! stay strong.
that was an awesome video. thank you very much melanie. I couldn t agree more. I think that the original definition of woke was meaning that we were supposed to wake up to the problems in society. but that has been twisted around so much to try and force people to except almost anything and everything  except for what is Christian and ethical and morally right. Im so happy to see someone in your line of work and at your age not afraid to talk about God on a public platform. thank God for you. God bless you and your family. duane.
God bless you for sharing his word in truth  melonie. I notice a difference in my own life when I skip even one day of reading my Bible. stay in the fight  and never be silenced.
I just wanted to tell you I appreciate what you did here. its clear that you were nervous talking about this stuff so boldly and obviously it was risky to do so. but I have to tell you I couldn t be more proud of what you did. you literally put yourself out there and risked the viewers you have to talk about something you care about. I grew up pentecostal and I know how hard it is to take thatstep forward and declare the gospel so I just wanted to say thank you for being brave enough to do this. also  if you haven t seen it you need to watch the chosen. probably the greatest depiction of Jesus ever put on screen. stay strong I gained a new level of respect for you today.
I was afraid to watch this video  not because I disagree but for the uncertainty it leaves me. Im glad I did  your words are very encouraging. and I will continue my personal relationship with our Lord
thank you for addressing this. due to the issues that you addressed here  I started a playlist in my you tube channel titled the new  Christianity . I have been concerned about these issues for a while after finding out that even some of the  Christian  singers I was listening to are  progressives   including nichole nordeman. I was pretty shocked by that  so I guess I had no idea how bad the apostasy has gotten. I knew it was bad  but it is worse than I realized.
thank you for saying it  and using your platform to spread truth!  I thought you were amazing before for your personality and eating butter.. but this! blew my socks off! Im completely amazed!! may God protect you! my his spirit lead you! fill you  and continue to give you that bold power to keep sharing the good news and truth! in Jesus s name! amen!
this is why im glad I grew up in the Bible belt and been exposed to so many variants of Christanity that one big thing I truly have come to vaule is the idea that every indivduial should be there own preacher and church and that those things arnt required nor should be required to worship just a luxury if possible and a outright hindreance if corrupted.
youth pastor melonie  hitting all the points and not holding back.
you hit the mail on the head here. I have a lot of progressive friends and when I used to hang around them a lot I would not honestly share the word but would alter what the Bible says in a way so I would be accepted by them and I hate myself for that. I dont have around em as much now just because of busy life stuff but I pray everyday that I ll never do that again and be more open to sharing my faith and what the Bible says about certain situations  and most importantly  be a good witness and no some poser that wants to fit in. God has been good to me and I want to give back what I can.
I know that Im late to the party  but I really appreciated this video. thank you for being brave enough to speak out!
this was an awesome video! always enjoy listening to your channel  but this one was really good for my soul
wow! I found this channel because I saw you on fnt.  I started to notice this  progressive  stuff seeping into entertainment over the last few years and eventually found the critical drinker and his issues with  the message   then eventually discovered the rest of the crowd. honestly watching you guys has been more entertaining than most of the crap hollywood turns out these days. anyway after finding out more and more about the woke movement and having been brought up Christian myself  itseemed to me more and more that it was not just an attack on entertainment  politics and culture  but a spiritual attack. I consider this to have been my red-pill journey now and once you see it  you cant unsee it. keep up the good fight melonie and God bless.
you are a refreshing personality! keep being you melonie mac!
the bizarre thing is pastors who have started in on this nonsense are calling those who wont sitstill for it  fools.  chandler at mlk50 comes to mind
thank you for this post. my wife and I left a church pre covid bcuz they went alphabet blm activist and stopped teaching the Bible. I pray for those who are so misguided as to thinking im not being Christian for drawing a line as to what is tolerable vs. what intolerable.  I dont want an alcoholic teaching my kids sunday school class either...or purple haired lesbians teaching kids about trans and white privilege.
@justinpitchford  its more than the alphabet.  Christ came to break down the barriers and divisions we humans put between ourselves.  he didn t care about jew  roman  gentile  corinthian  widow  leper  cripple  etc. we are all made in the image of God and we are to seek that out among ourselves. wokeism teaches the opposite. Christ taught that we are to be judged on our relationship with him and our actions not our status in society.  wokeism teaches the opposite. Christ preached that we should turn the other cheek. wokeism wants us to look for micro-aggressions.  woke goes against everything that Christ taught and lived. I cant fathom how preachers adopt this mindset. the alphabet is just the symptom of a far greater disease.  we need to address the disease and not they symptoms.
left the church where I had been an acolyte   lutheran alter boy   bc they went to the other end of politics  ignoring the gospel. walked into a service after living out of town  in my sunday clothes   got hateful stares like I cd not believe.
it is possible to be religious without a church. Imean if you feel those running it are corrupted or just running it to the ground in various ways  nobody can fault you for leaving. you do not even need to follow an organised religion to believe in a God or whatever. sometimes you get those who exploit religion to control others or to hide behind the bad things they do such as certain catholic priests. these people should be rooted out and removed.
I know some conservatives will hate her for tattoos
although the scriptures do encourage use to be together. the church is a body and like a body  there s all kinds of things within for it to function the way it does. when most people think church  they think a church  not the church. you get what Im sayin
bless. you got this
please dont share it without invitation  though.
@paul2377 I share by my actions not my words.
we left our church after hanging on for so long after seeing what was happening . we were like let s just hang in there basically after a year and a half  but finally tapped out. took us pretty much all of this year to find a church.  so sad but have moved on.
well said  this is my first time watching a few of your videos.  I ll be honest  I wasn t expecting a video with this subject matter.  I ll be interested in seeing more.  you ve earned a new subscriber.
Im a Christian   and I appreciate your standing by your beliefs because I find people like you not very often on youtube-especially gamers or whatever.
somehow I came across mel and now. Ive been binge-watching her videos. I canto notice thatshe s easy on the eyes easy on the ears  and can listen to her back to back and Im seeing thatshe s highly intelligent in everything she talks about. and I love how she actively talks about the Bible with such passion. and out of the hundreds of people I hear a day say Jesus Christ its a refreshing change to see hear someone not saying his name in a negative light. preach!
one of the reasons Ive only been to church once in the past 22 years. being a Christian in the chicago area is a bigger joke than mayor peanut. but thanks to my friend bianca  I will always make the amount.
great video! love going to church when you dont expect itsometimes.
brilliant. 100  agree. also  hope you have found another church by now and I think your motivation is right  wanting to find a church that is 100  in-line with God s word. you cant go wrong there!
just discovered you and your channel yesterday.  excellent video!  outstanding witnessing for Christ and using God s word to back it up.  agree 100  with your analysis of wokeness  how its all about control  and thatsatan is behind it all.  their objective is to destroy the church  same as the devil.  God bless you!  now back to the nerd stuff.
thanks for getting out the message.  your title alone does most of the job.  the algorithm will certainly put this in places.  you might use  tags.  there s  progressiveChristian and  progressiveChristianity if you want this to have more circulation to help out the algorithm.
I needed to have this talk today  thank you. also youre not crazy in the least homie.
to be honest most Christians Im around dont really care about what the entertainment industry is doing. they dont understand the ideological war or they just passively ignore it because its more comfortable for them. I dont even bother sharing my opinions about it because it makes them uncomfortable. but its nice to see there are Christians who do care. that makes me feel less alone. thanks and God bless
love this video! its awesome to see a believer take a stand for God  Jesus  holy spirit and the word. keep up the great work!
this was  thanks melonie God bless you
the way things have been happening for the past few years with the world how much its changing for the bad is why I began looking for God again  and he has placed people like you on my radar to follow and listen too God bless you melanie and anyone reading this
hImelonie I always enjoy seeing your incredible videos.I hadn t gone tochurch in many years.I absolutely enjoy seeing your videos.politics are never in Jesus thoughts.takecare melonie
I was feeling a little lost this morning  now I am found. thank you! after this im gonna throw on third day - a worship offering and get this day going.
great video mel! thanks for the truth mel!
remember when we d roll our eyes at our grandparents for calling things the devil now we re all grown up and it looks like they didn t take it far enough. lol
I respect and love how blunt you are with the truth!
this is so refreshing! praise God for his work in your life. keep on  sister! the king is using you to make an impact you cant imagine.
@adam  not as bad as our governor jabba the hutt.
get out of chicago!! youre life may depend on it!!
thank you soooo much! bless you
I think some people took calling stuff the devil to far and kinda just pinned blame on him for everything
I agree 100  with you. I hope you find a good church  I live in rural illinois and haven t been able to attend a church in over 10 years because none of the ones around me are places I dont feel good in. the  baptist  one by me is very progressive and is getting worse and the rest are mennonite and progressive methodist.
good for you melonie.  Im from the uk and personally come from the left of politics  but have noticed this increasingly over the years  on both sides of the political spectrum.  and in both cases those new ideologies are based on lies.  I d recommend having a read of  the screwtape letters  by c.s.lewis
love this! keep up the boldness sister! keep reppin  that romans 116 life!
I found your channel from your silent hill video  but I always love to learn more about Christianity. this was a very wholesome video
ah yes  I knew this was coming cause of the twitter thread from late last night! we going to church today with pastor melonie! a super good vid that had to be made!
your video made me think of one of the letters to the churches in revelation. revelations 2 12-17  the church claimed to be Christians but followed immoral occult teachings. thank you for sharing your faith. I know its helped so many people  whether by bringing them to God or helping to bring them back to the faith  like you did for me. Im sorry to hear you haven t found a new church yet  but I pray you ll find one that is true to the word of God.also  if you haven t watched the cooper stuff podcast  I think you would like it melonie. he goes off on this stuff all the time.
preach itsister! truth.
wow great video  I totally agree! progressive Christianity has become a real problem. which is why I agree like you said that we must be in God s word and following his commandments  and Christ Jesus s teachings! we as believers mustn t follow after the way of this world where wickedness is applauded and celebrated but must stand on God s word even if in the eyes of man its not politically correct! our savior Jesus Christ wasn t politically correct if you were doing something wrong he said so and was against evil and sinful behavior  God bless you melonie and God bless to all .
good video. theologically sound. thank you  melonie!
God bless you  melonie. you tell it like it is and are proud of your faith. it takes a lot of spiritual maturity and strength to stand up like you are. thank you for your amazing faith  my fellow sister-in-Christ!
hey just saw you on sacred symbols plus!  loved you there love your energy and glad to listen to ya preach!  as far as your church search goes good luck!  it felt like I went to all the churches in my town in order to find the right one!
I just subscribed when I saw you speaking on this subject.   I joined a 30yo  Christian page on fb years ago and Ive watched this happen rapidly in said channel.  its politics and pointing fingers within the chats now.  Ive ignored it for 3-4 years.
this video earned you a sub no doubt. your doing more research than some pastors I know.
great commentary  melonie. I d like to suggest looking up father roderick on youtube. he does  geek masses  where he ties in geek culture in with his homilies. he is great to listen to
Im a recent sub to the channel after your sacred symbols appearance brought me to know who you are  thatsaid I am so happy to see you take such a clear approach to Christ. thank you!
no such issues in my church. our pastors mention almost every sermon that  there s only two genders  and  we obey God before man  and  the church should be at the forefront of politics  not subservient to it . its great. I love my church great video btw. subbed.
well said! thanks for sharing this topic from a biblical perspective. keep on studying the word and sharing the gospel. I ll be praying for you.
keep up the great work. still loving the channel
thanks! your video was outstanding the issue is  our higher institutions of learning including most seminaries have been co-opted to the woke ideology ministers no longer are motivated to serve God but rather the new social order
awesome. great vid. all the way through. stay strong. keep the faith. go boom!
what makes you think youre right and they re wrong  you sound like youre full of your own pride. it comes before a fall...
if the world hates you  remember that it hated me first.  john 15 18  nlt
thank you for sharing and speaking truth.  subscribed.
youtube algorithms allows a new channel to slip through the cracks every once in awhile. glad I stumbled upon this video!
how am I just now finding this awesome channel    now begins the binge watching.
pisses me off  they leave islam alone and respect tradition tho
ephesians 4 26 -  be wrathful  but do not sin.dont let the sun go down while you are still angry.  a personal favorite. Im real good at wrath. its the  not sinning when angry part  I struggle with  lol
I love how they assume Jesus s politics then bash him as you said melonie. they re delusional. Im pretty sure Jesus wouldn t be for woke  cancel culture and ruining someone just for disagreeing with someone else. also did you hear about the story where some leftwing site said that the  rosary is extremism
hImelonie  any pointers on how to go about finding a good church to go to  Im finding the same problem as you are. I also work graves and early sessions are also a challenge. I appreciate your advice if you come across this comment. thank you and keep it up!
wow! thanks for this video...refreshing to hear you speak your mind...I totally agree with you and feel the same way! cheers
love it melonie amazing job bless you.
preach it melonie!!!keep going boom !
this was a great video melonie glad your calling this out. its harsh but necessary truth being a Christian  a real Christian means you will be hated and looked down on. but I rather have  God on my side than the world.
love a good argument starting with  Im a flawed human being  dont hold me accountable for the many mistakes Im surely going to make not to mention that the first sentence sounds like it came from kellyanne conway
most of the time when you press liberals to clarify the  Christ was libral  statement  they go to his call to charity as their foot hold to the faith. but if you apply  um actually  you find that those that identify as conservatives statistically more often are the ones that give to charities out of there own pockets while the more progressive rely on the government  other peoples pockets  to supply the assistance. great observation  this has bugged me as well.
another good video to enjoy very wholesome ms mac.
I know Im good  Jesus is good  therefore  Jesus agrees with me. -leftoids
randomly found you from a video game video  found this one next. I like your prospective  you explained your views well. subbed!
love this way to speak out
love you sis  keep being faithful   obeying God  this world nor the men in it can destroy both body   soul  keep getting wise   let no one put themselves above God   manipulate your heart God bless   stay safe
this was an excellent show  and exactly what I needed to hear. thanks my friend
amen
I wonder about the select respect for that religion but not for others.
nah  they have their eyes dead-set on ruining islam as well  they re just not as successful.
funny you mention that  my wife came from a Christmas catholic home  her sister is agnostic and lefty. my wife went to ny to see her family back in august and her sister said something along the lines of  religious  Christians  people are trying to take us back in time and hold us back  within the following 10 minutes her sister pointed out a muslim doing his prayers to their younger sisters and said  wow! thats so great to see!
Jesus wouldn t have been for ruining someone for disagreeing with someone else. but he was about love and acceptance and  Im sad to say  that a lot of Christians aren t. they seem to see themselves as above others  then they wonder why more people turn away from religion. they do satan s work for him  but they just cant see it.
best of luck in finding a good church melonie. Ive found a great one here in raleigh  nc.
sister  a have some great love for you. Imust say  after seeing you with mauler  I actually just thought you were another secular youtuber. I didn t know you were Christian. you have my respect sister. Jesus loves you so much! may God bless you. I do not know the extent of your faith  but I thank you so much for using your platform to talk about Jesus. that takes a lot and you have my respect. proud to call you my sister in Christ
I hear you girl Im scared right now. they are twisting everything. in order to satisfy themselves.
Im honestly still learning  but I love this
I posted in a facebook writing group seeking feedback for whether I should continue pursuing to write a female led scI fI  fantasy novel because its seemed men are being belittled in modern entertainment while women are portrayed as mary sue s. the replies  however few  were mostly more focused on whether or not such a thing were even happening
no worries. everyone is flawed to some extent.but obviously youre incredibly blessed. because you never seem to age...I think youre immortal!!
one that has terrified me was hyper grace and alot of this progressive Christianity Ive had to leave the church I went to for 20 years because the new pastor decided to go with hyper grace and progressive ideology I pray he has his eyes opened but that was a hard decision but ultimately cant condone false doctrine
I really found this to be refreshing to listen to-- especially your insistence for people to be bereans and check the word itself  not just take what anybody says as gospel truth. seeing someone with influence like you encouraging people to make sure they exercise wisdom and discernment...... thats super cool   I doubt I can guess the level of vitriol you go through. whether its people attacking you for your faith or attacking you for not being a mindless drone and consuming whatever empty  perverted product hollywoke throws at us... Im sure you deal with a deluge of junk at times. and  as humans  try as we might to act like it doesnt bother us... sometimes it really does. people s words can get under our skin.but I just wanted to say  thanks for not bending the knee  melonie. thanks for trying to be salt in a world growing so dark.thanks for being you
came over from nerdrotic... decided to look through your vids and found this treasure. this is great stuff since I have been thinking about this as well.
God bless you mel. thanks for your example and courage. amen
aww youre a Christian! thats awesome me too
you touch on something I definitely had a problem with as I first became Christian. Christ s sacrifice is not a license to sin  its a safety net for when you fall. and there s a difference between sinning in your life and living a life of sin. I certainly have my own sins  but I at least try to avoid and minimize it. and I was extremely worried before realizing that  but when I figured it out  I realized that I dont live for sin. God will know your heart  and will know if your sins were honest mistakes born of momentary weakness or were deliberate acts committed with the intention of sinning or without guilt. as long as you feel guilt and you make an effort  Christ wont retract his sacrifice for you. also  unrelated  but you give me a glimmer of hope that at least some women of my generation aren t absolute lunatics. and a recommendation  fallout new vegas. you d love joshua graham in honest hearts.  we cant expect God to do all the work.
put Jesus in a box . thats exactly what they want to do. and they are trying to do it with everything. to these folk....everything has to be in its little box  with its label on it  owned by them and can never be questioned or altered.
God bless you  melonie mac. youre not afraid to preach the gospel and you dont compromise it. its dope that you do nerdy videos  but I think its even better that you cantake a break from that and preach the word. this will not make you popular  and you dont care. very cool. continue to go boom.
at the risk of being mistaken for a  pick me   I love you so much  little sister
take us to church melonie  preach the good word.
good job on saying what I have been saying for years  amen  your a sister through Christ  and God bless  just subbed
so proud of you for speaking your beliefs mm! I know this puts a massive target on you and yet you still laid it all on the line unabashedly. keep fighting the good fight and let your soul shine brightly even if severely flawed  just like each and every one of us
melanie if youre still looking for a church that is more traditional in its teachings and practices yet isn t intrusive like a cult then I suggest you look into an orthodox church  preferably a greek orthodox church  I think you ll find what youre searching for in it  I have no doubt you ll be taken into the church with open arms  all you have to do is talk to the priest and just explain your situation  he ll look after you no doubt!
excellent video melonie!  I love these more Bible centric videos.I think this was the verse you were thinking of matthew 18 6but whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin  it would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck  and he were drowned in the depth of the sea.the idea that Jesus is a liberal is really silly.  itshows just how little the far left know what Christianity is.   was Jesus being forgiving and accepting of the money changers when he went to the temple and found they were making deals in God s house    no  he drove them out of the temple and threw over their tables they did business at.   or in isaiah 45 5 which says I am the Lord  and there is no other  apart from me there is no God.I will strengthen you  though you have not acknowledged me thats not a very liberal view of  you do you  and find whatever works best for you.   no  thats a clear black and white view that gives no room for nonsense.
as long as you feel guilt and you make an effort  Christ wont retract his sacrifice for you. what if I told you that even if you went back into sin youre still sealed by the holy ghost  because righteousness is not of works  its purely your faith in the blood thatsaves you. not saying there aren t consequences for sin  or that God wont deal with you directly  maybe even kill you  but once a son daughter  always one. otherwise  grace is ultimately void. salvation would only be provided if you are obedient to the law  but that negates the obedience of Christ on our behalf. he really did it all for us.
@dying rose  I d certainly be comforted to hear it  though it wouldn t mean Im suddenly relaxing my efforts to keep out of sin.
willful sin is what hardens the heart and eventually God will give us up to a reprobate mind.  sinning in error followed by asking for forgiveness then repenting is somthing every human deals with no matter how long in the faith we are.
@jason kemp  God will not give up his own. he said  I will never leave you nor forsake you. he deals with and punishes his children if we go headlong into sin  but he wont give us up to it. that verse thatsays God gave them up to a reprobate mind is speaking of unbelievers who do not even retain God in their knowledge  it has nothing to do with carnal Christians.

I just came across this channel wisht the she hulk video  then see this video and every you said is true. I got sucked in and now Im almost running late for work lol. you got yourself a new subscriber. lol
its not easy to be in the world but not of the world. but youre clearly demonstrating that God has continued to give you the strength to plow through. and I know he will guide you to a biblically sound church soon  melonie!
gotta stay spiritually fit!
as far as Im concerned mel  real Christians would not accept this cultist behavior  and churches that are accepting this aren t real churches.that being said however  we need to pray for those that are being mislead and hope that dont get fooled by these crazy cultist. but not matter what happens  in the end God prevails. stay strong.
the lack of practice of these things in the developers of once inspired and creative pieces of entertainment  and I d go as far as to even say classes and places of learning for my case  will sadly leave the stewards of these things vulnerable to the devil. all I  and we can do is pray for them  and to work hard ourselves to be in these peoples positions to hopefully one day make a better change and steer these blessed and enhanced forms of story telling of our generation back on the right track.not to force agendas and narrow minded opinions in lacking story s and dull game play  but to once again create games thatserve any who play them  story s which compels one to better lives and virtues  that allows them to exercise their perspective taking through simply well thought out game play. thank you for this video  mac!
stand up and be courageous girl. God has called us to be such. we weren t made to be milquetoast.
what youre saying has me worried if Imight have become the offender as you described from matthew 18 6. I have struggles myself I dealing with but the you described it makes me feel like I got no hope because I am dealing with some sins. this troubles me and makes me feel afraid that Imay be beyond any redemption
my favorite quote in the all scriptures   put on the whole armour of God.  thats why I dont say my beliefs my standards or anything I do is because of my political beliefs. no my faith is and always will be thatset by heavenly father  Jesus Christ  and the holy ghost. literally incredible video. have great one
one of the most important videos on youtube.  full stop.
they think Jesus was a free-loving hippie and they couldn t be further from the truth. he s just a tool they try to use  thinking they can control people by saying  see  Jesus is like this so you have to do what I want!   but they dont even know anything about him.
your beautiful soul is powerful. you made me have tears. thank you.
finished the vid.  amen sister!  preach on!
I really appreciated your candor when it came to your opening words  mentioning that you are not coming as a theologian  but as someone making comments on people s modern misunderstanding of both the Bible and Christians.  keep speaking truth to the best of your abilities  we need more people who are willing to share with a modern culture.  as a conservative evangelical pastor with a master of divinity degree who does preach the gospel and unapologetically preaches God s word  feel free to reach out if you have theological questions for future videos.  as I said  we need more people doing what you are doing.  be blessed!
well said mel
today I learned melonie is a Christian. word  thats an awesome surprise. thanks for sticking up for the word.
tremendous content! its time to speak up and stand together! you cant change the gospel  to spread your own delusional ideology.
just got done talking about this on twitter about religion. everyone has beliefs they live by. forcing those beliefs on others is the epitome of not being conservative and what drives the woke movement. thats political activism which is not a party affiliation its a belief system.
I appreciate this video so much
I ll share this with my faithful Christian friend.
Im not sure what if any investigation you have done into the catholic church  but I would definitely suggest researching their claims and supporting arguments. some good resources would be catholic answers  counsel of trent podcast  pints with aquinas  and even some podcasts that capturing Christianity  cc  has done with catholics. cc has some good dialogues from both sides too to check out.
nobody is beyond redemption. dive into your Bible and prayer every day. the closer we get to God  the more we want to distance ourselves from sin
yes sister mac. preach!
wow. some great words. I had just recently started watching your content  like last week  and now I am even more interested in your videos! love seeing a believer in all aspects of life.beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit  after the tradition of men  after the rudiments of the world  and not after Christ.colossians 2 8 kjvfalse doctrine is everywhere now and many people are being lead astray.
what can I say  when push comes to shove  no one truly wants  progressiveness  in their business  be it entertainment  church  or the atheists. there is just no common sense  just a whole lot of confusion and bitterness.I am sorry to hear that about your church and hope you can find a new one as soon as possible. I would like to think there are people in your church that can be reasoned enough to be convicted of their mistakes and repent. until then  thank you for being you and for sharing to us Jesus unashamedly and with as much care and thoughtfulness as you have done.
hell yea I dig the social commentary
I think this is the scripture you were trying to reference proverbs 28 1    the wicked flee when no one pursues  but the righteous are bold as a lion.
side note  Im sorry to hear the church you were at took the turn that it did. I hope you find a church family that will take the teaching of the word seriously for your sake - and of those who feel the same way you do. if you find yourself moving abroad to the uk  you d be most welcome at the church I currently attend. of course  God alone can guide you in the right direction. God bless you in Christ
God bless you melonie.
good job  young lady.well said.peace.
you are speaking my language. since youre looking for a church closer to God s word  I feel like seventh day adventist will be to your way  coming from one.
good video. hopefully you can find a good church soon.
hImel!  well if its your church I ll be happy to take a seat lol.   now I didn t read that article but I believe that the main problem is free will in all this.   sure its a gift God gave us but it also is our greatest falling.  and as long as we have free will churches will become far away from Jesus s intended purpose.   like now I having a tough time finding the right church because there s so many out there  in a way I just want one church to belong to but there is no one church. not yet anyway and I pray for the day Christ comes and there will be only one church.  finding a church is no easy task anymore and I wish it was. maybe in the future all we will have is the word and our personal walk with him is the only real leg to stand on.  see in my past I got confused with all the churches out there and went a little crazy to be honest.  I pray that you find a church thatstrengthens your walk with God. I will pray for you as all I always do and seek in your congregation thatstrengthens your walk with God.
I think your faith is beautiful  melonie.
pharisees   this woman is a sinner! Jesus   so are you. wokeies   see  Jesus says gay is okay! me   wait wut  great sermon  mel
yeah this is a tough one.  the more youread the Bible the more God reveals himself to you and the more you ll see how us Christianity is messed up.  always love your views
I d love to listen in on a conversation between melonie mac and alisa childers.
nobody puts Jesus in a box  -swayze
God bless you melonie
Im at my computer  adam sessler seal clapping and yelling  tell em !
this is 100 percent correct  you have to preach God s word with no compromise  no if  ands  or buts  its better to stay hated for standing for the absolute truth in God s way.  time to stand up against the evil.
I interpret  fasting  as meditation in the Bible  fasting while meditating can bring enlightenment after you get over the extreme hunger which only lasts for the first few days.
xd!
Jesus was gay himself.
@dragon ball fans cant read  no he was not
@bayley inc  he was.tongues were flying when he embraced judas.
little boom but a lot of punch.  God bless.
I subscribed to your channel because of this video. Christians cant be afraid to take a stand.
I 1000  agree the devil s hand is in this.
Im a Christian and I stopped church due to peeping this years ago. church is a business and it needs money first in modern times
the burden of faith lies in each individual s heart to do good and not the institution.
thank you!!!  I agree with your post and have also noticed much of the same things in society  in church  and  of course  in current tv and movies...  I also feel the new ads  humanizing  the Christ are part of the same problem  these ads only mention the humanity of Christ  and make absolutely no mention of his divinity.  satan is a fallen angel - he knows that yhwh is all powerful  which is why when he attacks he uses the word  but will change a little  leaven is small .  words of doubt like  if  are not small.  I do believe that Christ Jesus allowed himself to be sacrificed to atone for my sins  past present future  and those of the world.  I was very happy to hear you mention that he came to fulfill the law  not annul it!  I ll stop now  but thank you  thank you  thank you!
new intro  summarize your video in a minute or less  like done in the first 45 seconds of this video and then a boom like explosion transition. but then it goes back to you just sitting in the chair. lol dont be scared to record these in a different location. phone recording has come a long way.
preach sister! romans 12 2
there s a youtube channel name lutheran satire that has a cartoon called  horus ruins Christmas  where the woke pastor answers point for point what horus believes as opposed to the lutheran church. the meta thats often missed by the viewer is that the woke lutheran pastor is parroting what are pagan beliefs and  as you say  if satan is out there this is exactly how he s work to sunvert Christianity.
facts!!! you cant pick out a part of the scripture that benefits the point your trying to get across read the whole scripture!
if the world loves you... youre doing something wrong
well said melonie!the embrace of the progressive movement by churches has led to me pulling away from organized religion  but Ive not been overly close to organized religion for decades anyway.  I suppose Ive been more withdrawn into the hermit of faith than drawn into the community of faith since there s so much there that does not sit well with me.  and Jesus was completely apolitical.  earthly politics did not concern him except for when they infested the church itself.  and while he was personally conservative with his views  wanting to uphold the laws of God not change them  his apolitical nature meant that no political group could rightfully claim him.  though they try.  I didn t like it when it was the moral majority of the 80s and I dont like the secular religion that claims him but in name only now.  I still remember the paper I wrote in college about being secular and being spiritual at the same time  and the strange duality thatseemed to go with it.
8 43 youre not alone in that thought process. a lot of us have seen it and know.
amen sister  1 tim 4 1-2  now the spirit expressly says that in latter times some will depart from the faith  giving heed to deceiving spirits and doctrines of demons  speaking lies in hypocrisy  having their own conscience seared with a hot iron   stay strong in the faith - 1 the 4 16-17  for the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a shout  with the voice of an archangel  and with the trumpet of God. and the dead in Christ will rise first. then we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. and thus we shall always be with the Lord.
preach on preacher!!!!
preach my sister preach
progressive  used to mean wanting to improve society for the betterment of mankind. see theodore roosevelt s excellent speech called  what is a a progressive   I submit that the  progressive movement  is what has been hijacked. this has been a problem since roosevelt.
well said
the God-emperor protects against the agents of chaos.
continue to speak the truth. I will not conform to this world  I am hated because they hated my Lord and savior first. Imay be put death for my faith in Christ  but I can say I ll stand on the rock of my salvation til the very end.
amen sister  amen  great video
wow on point. dope channel
Im so happy you spoke about this. its usually only Christian  based  channels that do. a channel like this reaches other kinds of people with different beliefs
Im sick of these people  they seem to be blind to everything  this is why I stick to hacking to at least find truth.
well melanie  through the spirit of God you ve pinned me into a spiritual corner. youre not as well versed as I am but God knows my heart and Im compelled to confess that Jesus is Lord. lest I become an apostate and reach a point of no return. please pray for me.
thats what the prophecies say must happen and its our job to warn people and sit back and watch the fireworks.
I dont think youre crazy. I agree with you! God bless
where has the algorithm been hiding you. hI  you just earned a sub lmaoGod bless !
based!  also no one ever said not to judge.  its just that if you do judge be prepared to be judged also
two good channels that address this topic are cooper stuff and center for biblical unity. there are a lot of good youtube channels for Christians but I recommend these as john cooper is pretty blunt and monique came out of crt.
in the book of acts  there were a group of people called the bereans who would listen to someone teaching the Bible and then cross examine it with scripture in hand. Ive noticed an alarming amount of Christians nowadays not doing that and just listening to someone because they have the appearance of wisdom. the growth of progessive wokeism in the church is scary. thanks for taking the time to speak truth.
belma. the new scooby-doo series comes too mind. jinkies
I am one of the last crusaders and I stand up for God. I have never fed it to anyone with a shovel. I am not an evangelist. that being said I will not back down on what I believe.I have at many times debated with aron ra because or his and his fellow atheist attacks on us.you go girl.
perfect message
it is always cool to come across another believer in Christ  but it is also cool that you are a gamer as well and found your mission field.
totally off topic  but did you happen to frequent the splinter cell message boards  back in the day
how canthey take over that which they believe not nor even have an interest in
john 15 18 is the verse you were looking for re  hatred of the world  matthew 18 6 for the millstone quote. and Im glad I could give you something for one of your videos.
its sad but true...as Jesus said it is a narrow path seldom walked...it is a narrow gate
really cool to see you talk about things like this. the rot has been spreading for a while now.   edit  and she brought out the scriptures! you love to see it!
praying for you
u get 1000000 likes from me as a fellow Christian who also loves comics.
the Lord our God is able to use anyone in his good and perfect plans  however flawed we are. Jesus is God with us  God made flesh  and he came in person to save his people - 100  agree with you  melonie! he is holy and just and therefore worthy of all our adoration  yet he paid for the penalty for our sin by dying on the cross  imputing his righteousness as our own. we are saved not because of our  good deeds  but because of the gift of grace that he freely gave to us at the cost of himself.keep going  melonie mac! go boom!!!
great job  kid
to many people today are trying to create a God of their choosing in their own heads.  the truth is Lord Jesus Christ was very clear on what he expects from his followers and none of us can pick or choose what to follow.  we must deny ourselves and the world  pick up our cross and follow Jesus daily.  on a separate note I think you are an excellent role model for people young and old and that is shown through the fruits of the spirit you display.  I pray God continues to give you strength and knowledge so you can continue to spread the gospel and bring people to the truth.  thank you and God bless you.
for orthodox people such as myself this is so ironic
aye yo well done
try watching life source international. we will not conform to the secular world. I love your channel. found it looking up tomb raider videos but subscribing because of your morals. God bless!
again  madam   well said
ever since the early 2000 I have seen Christians slide down a slippery slope trying to do the nice thing the easy roll over and take itstance  slowly abandoning doing the right thing which can be hard.
I once asked God what s the best joke of all time in human history  a mirror fell on my lap!
whatever you might or might not believe  know what you believe. know it inside and out. you are much easier to persuade and corrupt when you dont actually understand your own beliefs.
as I pray for you melonie. I also pray that God will direct you to a good church  that isn t going down the woke progressive path. Im sorry that your last church went that direction. I hope that this video will speak to people and maybe some will come to know Jesus as their Lord and savior. may God bless you melonie and make you a light to others.
not crazy your right
amen  sister.  people who try to drag Jesus Christ into politics should always raise a red flag  Christ himself said  my kingdom is not of this world  and it was the popular jewish belief of his time  - that the messiah would be another king david who would rid israel of foreign leaders such as rome - which Jesus was continually fighting against.  and youre very right in saying Jesus Christ never condoned sinful living because whenever he confronted someone about their way of life or if he was performing an act of healing for them  he always told them something like  your sins are forgiven  and or  sin no more.  as for the woke and  progressive  Christianity  paul warned us all about them and he s speaking of  believers  within the church so it fits well with what you were saying  for the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine  but wanting to have their ears tickled  they will accumulate for themselves teachers in accordance to their own desires  and will turn away their ears from the truth and will turn aside to myths. 2 timothy 4 3-4
unexpected  but great nonetheless
fun fact  republicans used to be called liberals  like lincoln  when their ideals were young. as time passed and their ideals became the norm  they were considered conservative. same can be said about Christianity.
11 02 to 11 24 girl that applies to everyone and everything  when you first learn of anything and then find out what is behind it and what it is doing and then form an opinion on it and move on  and it is not inherently evil  its just how things are  and with 12 22 to 13 09 where is the 1 800 number for donations that I used to see with those televangists in the 80s  and 90s as your flat out telling people what to think  and being forceful rather than just letting them beand telling people their stupid because they are is one thing  that however is another. like religion lost its popularity because of things like that where people with their morals didnt feel that this was that evil  or is this really that evil  and then were told that in face of what they believed  which is what caused the rift and the disillusionment that you now haveand with the woke themselves  their a victim of the modern era of too much information and worry  when all they need to do to win and get better is to thrown their damn phone out the window and get a life and stop worrying about what other people think.which is what leads to 90  of their craziness to begin with  along with not understanding that the human brain undergoes changes all the way up until 25 when people learn how to cope and start to chill properly. meaning 90  of their life has been spent just flipping out at things rather than just enjoying life like a bunch of idiots
boom!!! you are so right.
isaiah 57 20  but the wicked are like the troubled sea  when it cannot rest  whose waters cast up mire and dirt.   these woke and progressive types are summed up well in this verse. stay true to Christ darling. how firm a foundation  ye saints of the Lord  he has laid for your faith in his excellent word!
I feel like most people dont know what it means to be properly woke. the word  woke  for the most part seems to used as an insult
pray for her tattoos
well liberal means to be free  problem is that definition has been warped to mean the exact opposite as it is with many things.
a lot of fake Christians who missed the message of the gospels.  why do you notice the splinter in your brother s eye  but do not perceive the wooden beam in your own eye     amen  mac
well said. the greatest thing satan ever did was convincing the multitudes that he doesnt exist.
preach!
preach it  melonie!  this is great!on a side note  for some reason liberals never realize that  after Jesus gave the famous  he who is without sin cast the first stone   speech  he turned the the woman and told her to  go and sin no more !  john 8 11b
here s the verse that melonie was referring to kids   matt 18 6  kjv   but whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me  it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck  and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea.   its talking about children and causing harm to kids.
praise Jesus. amen
none of that in my church. hopefully it remains that way. people are welcome but there ll be no pride flags or blm posters.
Im not religious at all. but I respect others religions and am honestly fascinated by the concept. even tho Im not religious  Im respectful and what their doing to Christianity is just wrong.
amen!
God said to judge righteously. Ive also heard that Jesus told the group that if youre innocent of sinning through her  then you canthrow the stone. they lusted after her or even did worse with her. at least  they had sins that were similar to hers. it wasn t about needing to be completely innocent in order to punish a guilty party.
Im an atheist for reasons  but I have admiration for Christians with this kind of attitude. another thing that I dislike are the Christians that are getting force-fed the message that God is in control  therefore they dont have to fight back against any of this bs.
I wish there was an easy way to like a particular quote.
do it to glorify God  and we will pray that God blesses people through it.
I need to be wise and go to church every sunday connect to faith
when we are all forced to take the mark of the beast  the churches that turn away and dont let people without the mark of the beast enter and pray  then will will know that those churches are fallen. and I believe 99  of churches are already fallen.
speak the truth even if your voice shakes
baruch  bless  you  mel!
he also forgives the sincere. mary magdalena was an important figure.
shout out to the one person who disliked this video lol
not here to convince you of anything  im a Christian here to agree with you. what you are pointing out  correctly  is that the Bible says God is in control  not those exact words  but that is the gist of it   and then man  used as a general term to reference some pastors priests in this instance  has misinterpreted that to mean  you dont have to fight back against evil . Jesus is clear in telling his followers to  buy swords   arm yourself   and that 2 swords is  enough . this is not to mean you cant have more than 2 swords  but the idea is that more than 1 is a good thing. why would we need swords if not to fight back at the very least in defense of ourselves and our religion as melonie quoted   satan appears as an angel   and I believe the church is currently being deceived...
@chris mcaulay  for me  there s an atheistic argument in favor of tradition. whether someone believes its the favor of God or survivorship bias  the concept of darwinism dictates that the most suited to an environment will survive. shortsighted  nihilistic atheists will conveniently ignore the fact that this applies to tradition as well. stripping Christians of their Christianity is akin to stripping a cat of its claws. you may think youre fixing a mild inconvenience  but youre tugging at the essence of what has let itsurvive to this point. tradition is a hereditary trait and needs to be protected.
they claim they are the party of tolerance and love. they claim to be the party of Christianity and faith but they attack God every chance they get. its disgusting. great video melonie. we were placed here in this time for the battle ahead of us.
Im pretty sure peter wrote out to the churches in revelations and one of them specifically warned of these kinds of Christians and the danger of it.
I think its been twisted since the beginning of its writing I dont think anybody has it close to what it really means.
idk Im a progressive and a Christian and  lol  not  woke   and just dont think actual progressive politics and wokism is at all the same thing.sure there s overlap... but I dont think its the same thing.I agree with you on a lot of points though.  I like your points about how Christians are tasked with not comforming and also with forgiveness  and how both are clearly not acceptable with being  woke  as its currently being employed.
see!  this is what happens when we get rid of verse of the day.
william shakespeare was a wise man. in the merchant of venice he wrote    the devil can cite scripture for his purpose.
Im not even Christian  but this newest development is completely asinine
beware  for the devil sings with the voice of an angel
last comment.  yes!  Ive been saying this for a while.  look  there is only good and evil period. there s no different tiers of bad or good  all these new isms and phobias are methods the children of the lie use to separate us from each other. there s no such thing as a ist or phobe  your either a good person or a bad one.Im not into the religious thing but dangit Im on the ripe side of 35 and Ive got kids and Ive been around the block but I tell you what if you help yourself and do right by Jesus things just kinda work out. and Ive come from a dark place  you might even say I was already in hell.
God bless you
I could swear Jesus commanded his disciples not to be apart of this world.
yea these are called progressive churches most of the faith dont claim them but there are lot of people conforming and it is alarming
truth!
it always comes to me as a shock thatsome of the reason american rejects progressiveness is because of Christianity because I always thought that americans or the west in general has lost their religion. I guess thats just my bias.
some people think fasting is hunger strike! lol
they conflate disliking an ideology with hating people. I dislike modern liberal policies because they re antI freedom. the people who follow them however  are different. we want them to see sense and stop pushing for the restriction of individual rights. God gave us agency. the modern liberals seek to remove that with use of government force.
dont you know  their God is their all-important  message  and they will sacrifice their own  and your souls  to spread it.
amen.
you may not consider this scripture  but you made me think of this scripture when you mentioned the progressives using the savior to push their message.2 nephI 25 25 the book of mormon25 forasmuch as this people draw near unto me with their mouth  and with their lips do honor me  but have removed their hearts far from me...
thank you
its refreshing to see someone thats passionate about their values - especially when they are unpopular.
we are not perfect and so we need perfect ideas to be able to make our world better. unfortunately political ideologies are not designed for making it better  only for bettering the domination of our brains by politics.
there is a lutheran church in the town I grew up in that  when I was young   had a woman pastor.  that was a bad sign then  because you have to twist or ignore books like corinthians and I timothy to square that circle.that church now flies a giant progressive pride flag.  whatever that lutheran church is  it has little to do with martin luther.
amen melonie
deeply unfortunate but not surprising. Ive heard people liken progressive Christians to saducees  which makes them an interesting counterpoint to the legalistic pharisees.
just remember that all religions did the same thing hundreds of years ago in what they thought was progressive at that time and millions died in the name that fitted the respective religions agenda. still good video and enjoyed it.
love u mel   here from fbg!
jkdbuck     totalitarians cannot abide people who can escape mentaly and recharge. it was forbidden in 1984. unless you were asleep your mind must be consumed with the politics of the party. thank God for tolkien who gave us the greatest playground.

Jesus is not confined to the us political system.   thank you for saying what should be obvious  but sadly is not in this overly politicized environment we live in.  Imean  he also wasn t confined to the political system of his own time on earth as a human  thatshoulda been the first clue.
I have no idea what progressive Christianity is but then again I gave up on religion 14 years ago so Im guessing a lot has changed
it all brings to mind these lines from the merchant of venicethe devil can cite scripture for his purpose.an evil soul producing holy witnessis like a villain with a smiling cheek a goodly apple rotten at the heart o  what a goodly outside falsehood hath!
this began  25 years ago.  there was a big divide in the protestant church....people started feeling comfortable admitting they were gay and some churches took a hard-line approach and some took an approach that was more  well we disagree with this particular part about you  but its only one small part of you who are from there  things on both sides just got more extreme  churches split  and we wound up with stuff like westboro baptist  and churches putting on drag shows for kids.  both of those things are equally reprehensible.not exactly surprising that fewer and fewer people are identifying as Christian.  the actual message has been buried under hate and acceptance of...shall we say...peds.I fully consider myself Christian  but I cannot bring myself to go to a church for worship. half of them would say I wasn t Christian to begin with  and the other half are busy ignoring reality and singing happy song time  totally unprepared for reality.  and none of them would encourage me to establish my own personal relationship with God.  they all want to curate it.  I can do that myself  thanks.  I can read  study and judge just fine on my own.Im former military  an officer  and I had several openly gay soldiers who worked for me. they all did their jobs and sometimes during down-time we would have conversations.  it was never hostile  and usually they would try and joke about things to make me uncomfortable  and I found it very refreshing.  I expect all of them would at least say that their interactions with me were not negative.  one  in particular  was the best lt I ever worked with  and Imade a point to reach out  take her and her wife out shooting  because I felt they were both very good people  regardless of orientation.  her wife was worried that during deployment she d be on her own and wanted to be able to defend herself so I tried to at least give her the basics.  it was great  and I wish both of them the best  even though Ive lost contact since I got rid of social media.people get so hung up on that one thing  when its mentioned less than 10 times....while greed and coveting your neighbors things is mentioned well over 100 times.  everyone has faults....but the church has collectively lost its way. they either celebrate sin  or bar people outright because of sin  when both of those things are exactly converse of the actual teachings they proclaim to follow.  its a sad state of affairs.
thanks melanie
15 40 matthew 18 6 if anyone causes one of these little ones those who believe in me to stumble  it would be better for them to have a large millstone hung around their neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea.
Jesus wasn t against violence.  a violence without anger  judgment or resentment.  like the money lenders in the temple  he simply did what needed to be done.
thanks!
too many people are looking for a  teddy bear Jesus   with only soft  warm hugs  instead of someone who paid the price for them to return to the father in heaven. with  teddy bear Jesus   we humans dont have to do anything  and we re  saved . as we take the invitation to follow him  we constantly need to work on ourselves  and repent daily.
melonie mac hotter than ever.
I would never say the conservatives follow God s word more. especially these days. holy cow! however  I agree with the image of Jesus being thrown into a misaligned context. unfortunately  too many stray too far from the truth and begin creating and spreading their own.
the people I feel the worst for are the pastors of these churches. I never became a pastor because of james 3 1. and I wish to God that these pastors would stop and remember that verse.
Jesus is the red pill og
you are bold to speak up like this when it can ruin your reputation. I wish I had as much boldness as you. working on it  just need to get out of my head and comfort zone. plz keep the faith and continue the straight path.
all this does is reinforce my own stance that you dont need a church to have faith. I haven t stepped inside an actual church or religious building in months  and it hasn t shaken my belief.
most people base opinion of Christianity on what they see on tv. I dont think the Bible has ever been more misunderstood then it is now.
to let someone be comfortable in their sin is tantamount to murdering them and pushing them into hell yourself.
as a progressive I practice what I preach. I am not without sin  but I would give my clothes to the homeless in the moment if he  she was walking naked in the street. our brothers and sisters sleep in the streets and its our fault for voting selfishly for our own gain. just like the cops. dont judge them all for a few bad apples
well said melonie! world needs more believers. sad that it is hard to ever have a conversation with a white girl about religion.
never have I fallen for the fallacy that these wokies have honest intentions at heart. I am not religious  though.praying isn t what wins us the culture battle.
here from sacred symbols
the cultists use Jesus to push their message.   Christians share his message to push Jesus.
they have been doing openly itsince vatican 2.before thatsince at least 1800s if not earlier.
if you look for a new church  try an eastern orthodox church. we use services which were used for the last hundreds of years. we are so conservatives that we still use incense in our services.
Jesus is a king. I promise  he doesnt take votes  there s only his way. and Jesus never complained about the government  mainly the teachers of the law.
well said  melonie  this was wonderful.check out perry stone on youtube.  his ministry is amazing as it pertains to sound doctrine  biblical prophecy  eschatology  nephilim  and much more.
4 44 wasn t the devils plan  they will follow my every command  they will all come back and I want the glory for myself   sounds like the  progressive  movement  progressing to a cliff  if you ask me  with their virtue signaling and conform or die mindset  raise your fist in  support  of blacks  is part of that great and abominable church as spoken of in the book of revelations... not saying others dont fit the bill as well  just stating the movement seems to have a lot of similarities.hope you have a great day   safe travels!
that verse is why I get so scared every time Imake a video like this  but I do the absolute best I can and pray that I dont ever misrepresent anything
@melonie mac go boom  100  feel that. went to a Bible school  after high school for two years  all we did was read the Bible book by book and listen to different teachers from around the world. thought I was pretty hot stuff afterwards  so did all the students  but since I left God has been telling me to  shut up and listen  and the more of that Ive done the more Ive seen how the arrogance and pride of man can poison everything. seeing that church in nyc have a drag queen be praised... almost made me cry. but I do believe  through personal things  that the Lord is telling me  after 11 years  to start putting my foot down and speak up to what s right and wrong in the church. hasn t made me any friends. so tho you dont know me  I am proud of you for following the Lords prompt and speaking up. thank you.
right on
thank you so much!
yayyy! thank you for watching
@melonie mac go boom  heavy first jump in the pool lol  good work though
true  Jesus ain t askin  permission  lol.
the teachers of the law are the government of israel  the high priest is the equivalent of the senate and congress.
@vivienne koo  Im referring to rome of the time. israel was roman controlled  had to abide by their law. plus there was a roman appointed king  herod.
@_n8thagr8_  nevertheless the pharisees remains as the senate congress of israel  it did not change.
@vivienne koo  nevertheless  they did not control the government at the time. that was rome.
@vivienne koo  Im aware they were already subjugate...under roman law. Im aware the pharisees had political power even before the romans  nevertheless  the people thought Jesus was going to overthrow rome. his beef was not with the government or ruling power. it was with teachers of scripture and those who were supposed to be the spiritual leaders. point being  Jesus didn t sit around telling ppl how terrible the government was. he told them how it was. which goes to my original point. Jesus is king. not republican or democrat. and time is better spent following his example and trying to help make sure ppl get to heaven.
the king of kings
no one puts Jesus in a box.
also notice how a lot of politics is based on a debate about who should society cater to  the individual or the group or both  just me hope you have a great day   safe travels!
if Jesus had a choice in modern government I kinda think he would either be conservative or possibly anarcho capitalist but I dont know why someone would want to put Jesus in a political box
this is true  but melonie also comes across as a pretty liberal  lgbtqI  excepting  female pastor  female skin showing type prot also.  the church need to learn to guard itself from progressivism.   and yes Im actually an anabaptist heretic myself but itseems like protestants are actively working to embarrass ourselves.
lol they can say they claim Christianity but in the end result they will be judged like everyone else.
Jesus fashioned a whip to drive out the blasphemous from the temple. the least we can do is guard our faith from infiltrators with ill intent.
when do u think u will go live on twitch again been a wile missing u
as a Christian  this frustrates me seeing this from them. a lot of people are ignorant and judgmental against real followers of Jesus Christ  as the former derogatory term  Christian  ofc suggests. many dont know this but Christian used to not be nice to say as the first followers were jewish israelites. it wasn t until much much later when it got coined as a name for a religion.the Lord says there will be many false Christs in the last days. and not just in the way where people will claim to be Jesus  but present teachings that create a false image of Christ such as what s being covered here. a demon s favorite weapon is deception. the corinthians didn t just believe paul when he came to them. they examined scriptures daily to see if they lined up with his teachings and they were called noble for doing so. we gotta be like the corinthians and test every spirit if they claim to be from God.
the political philosophy which most closely aligns with what Christ taught is libertarianism.  which is ironic  because libertarians tend to be the most overtly atheist.
1st john 5 19 rev 12 92 tim 3 13 misled
Im sorry your church feel away from the word. if you are interested in a God lead church the church my wife and I recently joined and rededicated our lives to God in does services online. I think you would enjoy brother jackie s sermon s. he doesnt sugar coat it. eden westside baptist church. a thing about to telling someone about God is starting up a conversation with them and than ask where do you go to church and go from there.
isaiah 55 6 seek the Lord while he may be found call upon him while he is near.
they who claim they are without sin speak not the truth  and neither is the truth in them.satin does not disguise himself as an angle of light  he was the right hand light and is an angle of light. in fact any human that would see him would mistake him for God on sight  lest you pay attention to his words and deeds. that is what makes him so dangerous . he is not going to show up as a red demon with horns and going boo.yes the principalities are what we fight.
if youre looking for another church or place to learn and understand the Bible more clearly I highly recommend grace ambassadors on youtube. they teach the Bible according to 2 timothy 2   15. they have helped me see the Bible in its proper context and understand things more clearly that were muddied up by religion and denominational Christianity.
Jesus wanted the poor taken care of  but reducing being liberal to that one characteristic is silly.
render unto ceasar what is ceasar s  and unto God what is God s!
Jesus  teachings were that people should live for one another and forgive one another for their transgressions  and he was a pacifist.  these 2 things are in direct contradiction to individualism and democracy statism which are the tenants of enlightenment liberalism.  though forced collectivism isn t the answer either  it must be voluntary.
glad my church preaches against progressive Christians. Imyself am not the best Christian  as I have a hard time sitting down and reading the Bible  but Im at least working on myself to be a better Christian compared to those that blaspheme the word of God and convert the church into a church of the world.
if you dont mind streaming only.   as.I dont think you live in florida  my church is a strong Bible believing church in newport richey florida and we stream  .sunday morning services live every sunday I can send you or anyone the  webpage and facebook info  just let me know also I can send it to you on discord as well if that would be more acceptable
as far as I cantell this battle was lost over 20 years ago.the moment the  popular church  caved to lgb ideology they became no better than the pope selling indulgences in the time of martin luther  causing the rise of protestantism .so in my view today the protestant church by and large has receded back into the trap of excusing sins in trade for money the same as the catholic church relied on half a millennium ago.
my church shut down services during the pandemic. I haven t been back. why go to a church that doesnt even believe in its own doctrine
I have a hard time reading the Bible too  reading in general really  but I get exactly what you mean. and people treat it like  thats no excuse  youre not trying hard enough    they dont know what they are talking about!!!
@timbothruster afterburn     ya  especially when you forget or have multiple things going on and its so hard to start that new thing cause the time investment will be long. Ive even tried spending 15 minutes of time to read but even then something comes up
what is your take on providing services over zoom
the thing is that the entire  woke  ideology is based on liberalism   the bedrock of western civilization including the usa   which is inherently athiest.so your issue is with the Godlessness of society  you need to fight athiesm  and bring people back to traditionalist beliefs  including all the stuff modern society finds  quirky  or  oppressive  this includes modesty in clothing  behavior and worship.individualism is the problem.funny thing is that communism and marxism are based on empowering the weak against the strong  which is the traditional Christian ideology   hence why the church and the commies were protesting the tzar in russia side by side the problem is that leftism in general is atheist  so while the liberals calling Jesus a liberal   in opposition to liberal conservatives  the gop   are in a way correct  but wrong on the fact that while Christianity opposes the gop s individualism in favor of community mindsets. the liberals are individualists too   my body my choice etc. religion doesnt map onto us politics that well  since both the left and right are liberal  i.e. the are based on individualism  whereas traditional religion recognizes the importance of sacrifice  and recognizing that equality is not an inherent good  and that inequality and hierarchy is important  wheras liberalism opposes this and wants to abolish things like the patriarchy since they see it as inequality and hence as bad.so while it is true when a democrat progressive says Jesus would stand against the gop championing rugged individualism as an excuse against universal healthcare  they are wrong on the belief that Jesus is an individualist  since all humans are created for ultimate submission to God.
conservatism was built upon Christianity  so to say he wouldn t align with them is saying you dont understand one or both of these entities!also  thinking you can be proud of your sin    celebrating it will get you into heaven is some real mental gymnastics I haven t seen since  men can get pregnant but only women can speak on abortion  argument!
its an ideology. all religions are. ideology- a system of ideas and ideals  especially one which forms the basis of economic or political theory and policy.take note of the first part  because thats the part that matters. religion has be a governing system since it was first a thing. this isn t necessarily a bad thing. Im not particularly religious  but I also dont negate its importance to others. if it helps someone find purpose in their life  and helps benefit them in a positive manner  who the fuck am I to judge
13 35 matthew 5 10-12  blessed are those who have been persecuted for the sake of righteousness  for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. blessed are you when people insult you and persecute you  and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me. rejoice and be glad  for your reward in heaven is great  for in this same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you.
they will do what is right in their own eyes and justify itso.my gay co worker whom I work with of course and I usually will not discuss religion and or politics at work. this is a good thing for one work is not the place to be discussing these things and or opinions.for two we both know that we do and will not see eye to eye on these issues  so discussing them would be fruitless and not be likely to change anyone s mind.now she is also an atheist  which is fine by me. if God wants to reveal himself to her then it will happen. I do not feel the need to try to evangelize her.so at work the other day she tells me that nowhere in the Bible is it written that it is a sin to be gay  and even if it did  thatsin isn t a real thing so it wouldn t matter I laughed and told her thatshe should re-read the Bible because she missed some verses  and that weather or not she thinks it is in there or not that the simple fact is  it either is a sin or it is not.now I have enough things that I am sure that God will want to talk to me about as I believe that is how it works  and I am not worried about any others issues.I do see the acceptance and appeasement Christianity taking hold though  and it is scary  but have faith that God knows it exists  and the Bible warns us about it.
when Christ was on the earth  he intentionally stayed out of the politics of his day. and you are right saying Jesus wouldn t fit into any political ideology of today. he is the law  and is king of all the world. we are to follow his law  not shape his law into our flawed politics.
the devil can quote scripture to suit his own needs indeed.
as a theologian with an mar  mdiv  and mth from liberty u  I cantell you the modern western church s move away from formal theological training as a requirement to be any kind of pastor and the rise of nepotism in the church is a big problem.  oh and ordanation is a joke  every other profession has formal requirements but to be pastor you just have to be liked and say things people want to hear instead of biblical truths.  I dont work for any ministry or church because  as I have come to understandthe following sounds cynical but other recruiters have confirmed it and it is what I have learned.the issues are 1. I have not spent my life in the church.  under qualified 2. I dont have a made for prime time tv conversion story3. I am not married with kids and a mortgage4. I am not independently wealthy or independently self-supporting.  for example  at my current church  they have a pastor with no formal training but he owns a few gyms and is charismatic so they made him a campus pastor.  he is a pastor but he cant actually help people or create lesson plans and they dont have to pay him.5. I have too much education  over qualified 6. not part of the church s family tree of staff.  all too common when I look at church and mission about us pages.7. my formal theological training is a threat.  paul was a threat to peter see galatians 8. my ministry is informal or when God says go into that den of ill-repute and give people tangible hope and an action plan to get out of their situation.  ie Im not concerned about my reputation or resume enhancement and awards. 9. I dont want to fundraise my own salary ontop of teaching and preaching and doing admin and pastoral care. for example  I knew a guy who was cut off by every single sponsor when it was discovred in order to work for mission organization he had to give the mission  10-25 of everything he raised.  people wanted to fund him  not his employer.10. I care more about a relationship with Jesus than a religion about Jesus.11. every retiring youth pastor I interviewed said it was not worth the risk of even the false accusation of impropriety even if one follows the billy graham rule all it takes is someone not liking the person and we cant exactly get restitution out of a minor for lying or filing false reports and too many institutions instead of doing proper investigations just as the kids say yeet the accused and hope they dont have to deal with wrongful termination lawsuits down the road.
when you leave a church dont sneak off. you need to tell the pastor why you are leaving or he will not know how he is missing the mark.
never knew that an ancient ortodox rabin living in the age of slavery and beliving in the literal sense of the Bible  including all its interesting punishes for women  gays and atheists  should be mistakenly deemed as liberal  d
so late to the comment but I ll bring it up anyway as a fellow follower of Christ. we often talk about gatekeeping  and in all honesty the gospel is the most sacred thing we ought to gatekeep. why  because the gospel is the gospel  God s law  command  and message written in scripture for man to follow. you cannot change God s law to fit your own narrative  you cannot change the sacrifice of Jesus to fit your own agenda. no  Jesus did not come to overthrow the governments of man at the time. no  he did not belittle others on  social justice.  he came to live the sinless life required to get into heaven  and then be sacrificed in order to pay for our sins. he is the way  the truth  and the life. no one gets through to the father except through him. that is what Jesus came to earth for- not to be a rebel  not to instill an uprising  but to provide us with a path to cleanse ourselves and reach heaven.Christianity is obedience to God and Jesus. accepting Christ s gift to us is the only way to cleanse ourselves. mosaic law  as stated in the Bible itself  is the manifest of God s love. as our pastor said  the ten commandments are like a series of house rules  meant to be the cornerstone of our relationship with the Lord and each other. they are his foundation for how we should live our lives and treat one another. thou shalt not kill  though shall not commit adultery  thou shall not bear false witness against thy neighbor  thou shall have no other Gods before him  etc. these cannot be ignored  they cannot be twisted. they are his guidelines for us  and we have no right to alter them as they were are the command of God  not other humans.you dont enter into the relationship with God and then try to change his rules.  to put your own spin on the word of God is really the ultimate sin  and perversion of the one who blessed you with life. no true follower of Christ should be okay with that  and when you see the devil in your midst he must be called out. that is the main plan of satan- to separate us from God and steal us from him. what better way to do that than to have people hijack the gospel and twist it to a different narrative  so yes  the gospel is sacred and  more than any fandom or entertainment community  must be protected and upheld in its intended design.
fortunately my church didn t conform to the woke movement
american individualism has made that country great because of the achievements of exceptional individuals. but the american approach to Christianity  namely evangelicalism denominationalism   its just me and my Bible   where everybody and their mother have their own denomination  and  they re all valid   doesnt thatsound suspiciously  woke     makes it easy prey for bad actors. divide and conquer  and youre already divided. you dont have to come back to the universal  catholic church  but at least american evangelicals should organize some sort of common standard regarding current affairs to stand against invading ideologies.
yes this woke movement is demonic
why do you think conservative episcopalians are leaving the woke episcopal church for the anglican church. Jesus wasn t a radical trying to change judaism. he was a reformationist trying to bring them back to God.
liberals   those people over there are evil and racist yeshua   so are you and remember not to be judge as you will end up receving the same liberals   but but but im a virtuous savior of minorities as I virtue signal yeshua   your words may sound like honey to you  but to me your mouth and heart are daggers and full of pride and sin liberals    reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
hey melonie mac!.....I you.
these people think Jesus was some peace loving hippie. dude flipped over the tables in the temple because the rabbis were scamming people to worship in his father s house  and he came to not bring peace but bring a sword.
thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil...    exodus 23 2  kjv
there are gay people who are Christians and try to do no wrong imo itshouldn t be a sin
just cause a political side was built with a strong tie to a religion doesnt mean he would automatically be on their side
like I said in the video  Jesus is God. we follow him  he does not follow us and our constructed politics.
Jesus would ve called out the hypocrites who live to hate trump despite their own sins.
@adam  no  he said   love your enemies.  matthew 5 44
@adam  however  he also said something to the effect of  worry about the log in your eye before the splinter in others.
you never grew up around methodists in the 70s did you   they were a lot more progressive than anyone today.Jesus only had two commandments.love the Lord your God with all your heart  soul and mind. and love your neighbor as yourself.the other ten came to us from the jewish torah  aka the old testament Jesus also said   let he who is without sin cast the first stone.
Im an atheist. Ive observed the behaviours of the religious my whole life  both goo and bad. one thing thatstrikes me is how much this  progressive  movement has in common with Christianity. things like sin  istaphobia  mysogyny   a soul  gender  separate from the body  accusations towards non believers   you just hate  insert marginalized group here  or  you dont want to lose your privilege   ie sinning   . its not surprising they ve come for churches  they ve infiltrated everything else.
if you are in arkansas  then I can help you find a good church  in the mean time I highly recommend you check out the you tube channel known as fight for truth.
progressive Christianity is an empty shell of theology if you think about it. there are no conviction or challenging old beliefs.
thanks
well  changes happen when there is zero sense of sacred tradition. sacred tradition ensures that the dogmas and ways to interpret scripture over ages and ages remains uniform.prior to 1930 contraception was considered unbiblical and immoral universally across all 9f Christianity. the anglicans changed first and everyone else followed. when there is nobody guarding the deposit of the faith you get churches that  change with the times.
1 of my biggest concerns with the Jesus picture and Christianity in general is the acceptance of hate.  the word  the concept- throwing it around like it has no meaning.  God hate this  God hates that...God does not hate  period!  God is so far above hate that its truly sick to associate such a human concept in the context of the grand creator!  hate comes from fear  anger  resentment  envy...and you dont think God is above all of that   you think those are things we as humans are suppose to feel   this is why we rise above and throw that trash out!  I have never heard a Christian speak out against hate and it makes me sick!
progressive Christianity  is an oxymoron.
pharisees are more comparable to conservative as the were distinguished by strict observance of traditional and written law Jesus considered them self-righteous and hypocrites. wokees would be more like the sadducees as they denied the resurrection of the dead  the existence of spirits  etc.Jesus didn t think much of them either. Jesus came to fulfill the mosaic law and to bring us to a higher law.  the first great commandment  love the Lord thy God. the second great commandment  love thy neighbor as thyself. unfortunately many Christians forget this in their zeal to stamp out evil. how can you pluck the mote out of thy neighbor s eye when thou hasts a beam in thy own eye. enjoy your content.
great Bible verse melonie. anyway I just want to say and tell you that God is God and he is omega and the beginner to the end and God cantear down the devil   God can protect the people who is a Christian from the devil so that the Christian people can be with God when people who are Christian die and can be with him forever up in heaven  ok melonie. anyway I just want to tell you that and I just want to say that God loves you and everyone who is a Christian or not  ok melonie. anyway I hope you had a great day today and I hope you continuing to have a wonderful   great blessed evening at home   have a good night too melonie.
too many thoughts here  so let s start with congrats on responding to your need to speak on this topic.  the liberals in society dont people speaking out.  freedom of speech and honest debate dont exist in a place where one side screams foul  or cries or sues you or kicks you off your favourite social media sites .  you ve certainly triggered some interesting response.  it is sad though to read text like  Jesus are fiction   as thats just plain lazy thinking  there s mounds of physical evidence that he existed.  but this is nothing new.  80 years ago  a young actress named jane russell was becoming an international sex symbol  most often recognized in  gentlemen prefer blondes  1953  .  she admitted being saved as child  and she carried her faith with her into adult life helping start the hollywood Christian group  which was essential a Bible study group.  her life saw her choose to be an opponent of abortions and founded the world adoption international agency  that apparently helped place over 40 000 children.this is what faith should be  and when one is confident in who they are and what their God expects of them  there is no need for hatred.  love should conquer.  we should be able to find common ground.  but today people  especially the younger ones  are offended by everything.  how can anyone learn and grow when you decide you already know everything.  time and experience helps those willing to learn to improve themselves.  if your dating life in your 20s is the same as when you were 17  how crappy would that be.  your critical thinking should improve as well as you grow.its been suggested that winston churchill spoke   if you are not a liberal at 25  you have no heart. if you are not a conservative at 35 you have no brains .  the bulk of this sentiment does back much farther than churchill  so this testament of transition when growing older appear to apply to many  many generations.  the truth of most topics are often very simple -- what s first the chicken or the egg   not a problem ... God created the chicken  and chickens have eggs.  but people that refuse obvious truths insist on complicating things.  so we cant have male and female  because this women is too tough  or this man is too gentle.  seems we need new labels for every combination.  everyone wants to belong  or feel they belong  somewhere  and its so sad how  feelings  are the most important topic today .  when youre in the ground for a few decades  someone could dig up this person and discover they are either xx or xy -- wow  not complicated.helping people having a place to belong is the responsibility of everyone and we dont have to screw up the basics in life to accomplish it.  yes there are things that God hates  but people are not one them.  the death of Jesus was not complicated except that the people witnessing didn t understand the story unfolding before them.  the simplicity is that of a basic choice  to believe or not to believe.as far as wokness is concerned  it appears thats about keeping the populations confused and off-balance  avoiding simple truths  and it could just mostly be about making money.  and we all know about the love of money.
does your discord have anyone who can cater to eastern orthodox Christians  by any chance I dont follow the teachings of the post-schism followers  the catholics and the protestant offshoots of the catholics  who place the words of fallible men as equal to that of God  so as much as I respectfully leave them be as well-intentioned Christians  I wouldn t pray with them  using their prayers  that venerate people like the pope.
matthew 7 15-23
was Jesus liberal  he seems like an outraged patriot to me matthew 5 17 do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets  I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.
I went to elevation in orlando  @ me if you know any good churches in that area  and I left because I realized that the pastor was really the one being praised and not God he talked more about me and how great we are and less about God  aka the prosperity gospel  not the real gospel  I want to learn about God not about me or how special I am
the Bible is impossible to understand if it isn t studied in proper context. there is only 1 verse in the entire Bible that tells us to study the Bible and how to study it which is 2 timothy 2   15 kjv. all other versions of the Bible remove the word  study  and  rightly divide  from that verse which is one of many reasons why I believe the kjv Bible is the only proper and real translation of the Bible. studying the Bible the way the Bible told us to is the key to understanding it. Jesus  kingdom gospel to israel is not the gospel revealed to paul after his damascus road experience. most Christians think paul simply was told to continue what Jesus preached to israel which is not true. paul said what was revealed to him was not made known to man before him.  ephesians 3   5-10 you also mentioned hebrews 10   26 again which as Ive said before is a verse taken out of context by most Christians and used to instill fear in saved people and make them question their own salvation. the entire context of that chapter is about animal sacrifice being done in place of Jesus  sacrifice for their sins and you see this if youread the whole chapter. you cannot take one verse  rip it out of its chapter and context  then use it to say something that its not referring to. that is how religion is born and why Christianity is the way it is today  full of denominations and religion. look at verse 4 and 6 in hebrews 10  verse 4   for it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins.  verse 6    in burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure.  the writer of hebrews mentioned this for a reason because in that time there were many jews still rejecting Jesus  sacrifice and continuing with their animal sacrifices that they still believed God required of them for their sins. if they continued on offering animal sacrifices for their sins  they are willfully rejecting Jesus and trusting their animal sacrifice to pay for their sins rather than Jesus  sacrifice. that is the entire context of hebrews 10. the  willful sin  in verse 26 is the sin of continuing animal sacrifice after receiving the knowledge of the truth which is that Christ died for our sins. it has absolutely nothing to do with saved people because saved people are sealed with the holy spirit of promise  ephesians 1   13-14  and made righteous by Jesus  obedience on the cross  romans 5   19 . every saved soul is going to struggle with sin for the rest of their lives. when we get saved our souls are redeemed but our sinful bodies have not changed yet. we are still stuck in our sinful bodies which is why paul said the good that he wants to do he finds himself not doing but acknowledged the fact he is still saved. its a struggle for every Christian. everyone who gets saved has acknowledged they are a sinner  cant save themselves and needed a savior so they believed Christ died for their sins. no amount of right living before a person got saved was able to make them saved and no amount of right living after a person gets saved is going to keep them saved or undo what the blood of Jesus did for them for failing to do so. no one who is genuinely saved believed Christ died for their sins so they can go on sinning happily without guilt. anyone who says they are saved but lives happy in sin is probably not saved to begin with. everyone who is saved will feel guilty about sin but the peace they can have is living knowing that they are a beloved child of God. they are sealed with the holy spirit of promise and they are made righteous by the blood of Jesus. these things cannot be undone by a truly saved person.
so  just in the interest of accuracy  since we re all flawed humans  but doing our best  Jesus didn t lay down any commandments. that was moses. it was in the old testament. I get that accuracy is difficult to come by  of course! also  st. paul doesnt even quote Jesus in ephesians. its his own interpretation. he also says   22 wives  submit yourselves to your own husbands as you do to the Lord. 23 for the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church  his body  of which he is the savior. 24 now as the church submits to Christ  so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything.  sounds a lot like that other religion y all are always complaining about. finally  not to belabor a point  but you seem to imply that Jesus  teachings somehow square better with the conservative  free-market economic model. Jesus is quoted as saying that it would be easier for a a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter heaven. how  in your understanding of the testament  do these two viewpoints square how do you see  love thy neighbor as you love yourself  as meaning anything but kindness and compassion  or do you just not love yourself very much
how do you square your Christian faith with supporting tolerating homosexuality   what does the Bible say  for clarity   one can hate sin yet love the sinner  but that does not give any of us the right to ignore accept what is clearly defined as against God s law.
there are certain people who like to claim Jesus is a  liberal    a leftist   a  progressive   even a  socialist   etc. of course  if you ask them  if they actually believe in him  not just his ideas   obey his commandments  and respectfully follow him daily  according to the way he said we must follow   obey him  these people always fall silent  or are unable to give a definite answer. why  because in reality  they dont really love or care about Jesus. they just want to use his name and likeness  to win ideological arguments  and give some level of  attractive credibility  to their social cultural political parties  and or  movements.
is that in every context or certain ones cause there s lots of changes that were good and bad that happened for different reasons
@yu lee   changes to dogmas are never good.  they re heresies that lead people astray.  its why there s thousands of denominations that disagree with each other on the most basic things.  the only constant in protestantism is disagreement.  its what happens when the authority of the apostles and the church is abandoned for personal interpretation of scripture.  pick any given denomination or church and it basically comes down to that particular pastor s view of things  devoid of ties to historical interpretation of the scripture and very often the people making these interpretations do so without any knowledge of history  judaism  hebrew  greek  etc.  90  of the time they re also oblivious to the writings of the early church fathers as well and the history of how said scriptures were read in the past.the very canon of scripture is a tradition itself given that there is no divinely inspired table of contents for the Bible.
@ray pastora  I guess but from what I know the Bible has various translation that are right wrong or close and people have misinterpreted changed taken out or just believed in as is with what itsays cause it benefited them they didn t really try questioning it or look deeper or there told is nothing but the truth and spread it around without fully understanding it
God does hate and the Bible very bluntly and clearly speaks of what God hatesGod is love  therefore he hates evil
your sentences have no correlation.
nobody has to support anything against their faith  and they shouldn t honestly. we are still to be kind to others  though.
@melonie mac go boom  in an older video  I believe the one where you explained why you are no longer at gamestoptv  you said people found something from when you were 17  and that you ve changed your opinion.  if I remember correctly  it concerned homosexuality.  I ll ask again...if that is the case...how you square being a Christian with that change in opinion
in fact  when youread the Bible  its progressivism at its core. youre stuck in a much distant time  as opposed to seeing how Christianity was a psychological weapon. you might wanna look into something called  the dark ages .
I was raised catholic and did all the things that came with it. Ive been atheist for a long time now.. you do you as long as it doesnt interfere with others is my belief system.
why do they have to be so bad at it
I find it hard to believe that youre so sensible  yet also believe Bible verses and think the woke movement is from the devil.
yes
the reason both sides claim him is most likely because he is a made up character in an obviously fictional text. look into what s actually in the Bible and apply a tiny bit of critical thinking skill and then hopefully you ll realize that only children should believe that whimsical magical fantasies are a reality
I do not permit a woman to teach or to assume authority over a man  she must be quiet.  - 1 timothy 2 12I think youre well intentioned  melonie. but no need for this here.
religion is one of the cornerstones of conservative  aka the right  culture and they think a big religious figure is liberal   what type of mental gymnastics is that
are you by any of those puquios  or do you know any1 that has some complete good photos of em

Jesus is the narrow path.  not right or left but straight down the middle.
Jesus greatest commandment was  dont be a dick.
wow incredible to hear you talk about this. I like to call this movement the  agenda  this world is progressively becoming evil. we are slowly being influenced by the evil spiritual powers through video games or movies or tv  shows youre going to see an increasing amount of sin put in these shows and video games and movies to influence you. the word of God never changes we shouldn t either. please remember these words from john 15  if the world hates you  remember that it hated me first. the world would love you as one of its own if you belonged to it  but you are no longer part of the world. I chose you to come out of the world  so it hates you. love you guys. and melonie its so good to have a breath of fresh air and hear this coming from you.
matthew 7 16-216 ye shall know them by their fruits. do men gather grapes of thorns  or figs of thistles 17 even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit  but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.18 a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit  neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.19 every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down  and cast into the fire.20 wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.
why is that
you are correct. but good luck getting most people to realize this.
Im not a pastor  Im making videos on youtube and people can choose to watch or not
@melonie mac go boom  sure  but respectively  the context of the passage is not about whether youre a pastor or not. the early church didn t have pastors.
isn t the literal translation of this verse is talking more about marriage and the rolls people play  not about not let a woman spread the word   also you say    the early church didn t have pastors   who do you think people like paul and silas were. and your verse is from the book of timothy isn t that book like the first manual on how to be a pastor   ephesians 4 talks about pastors  acts 20 talks about pastors   even in jeremiah 3 it talks about pastors in the old testament  so it is just wrong to say they didn t have pastors
@sparkiet88  well yes  in ancient patriarchal culture  which included Christians  women played the role of a submissive wife in the household  and maidens  those not married  were the property of their fathers until they were married to become the property of their new husbands. that is the context here. new testament Christians were fine with this  as was paul and the other apostles. they also thought slavery was normal.paul and silas were apostles. thats more akin to the catholic bishops who came later in history. their roles were much different than standing behind pulpits reading out the Bible. many didn t have a Bible yet. a lot of it was oral tradition which was written down and copied gradually over the centuries.got it  okay.
@joseph percy  silas was definitely not an apostle Jesus never called him personally. plus a bishop s job  one of  is to be a pastor for pastors. sure the Bible wasn t compiled into one document until later but the churches had scrolls and books and such  the gospels were written down within a generation or two of Jesus   not centuries later.
@sparkiet88  silas supposedly  not being an apostle  is really not the argument here. however  what you ve been taught is wrong.           means  one who is sent out   or  to send  - its the literal meaning of messenger. the original twelve   paul  having met Jesus in a vision  supposedly  are all granted authority to commission others  such as silas  to be messengers. that is called apostolic succession.
@joseph percy  by that logic wouldn t all ordained pastors be apostles   why then do we make a distinction  or better yet why does the Bible make the distinction between them  also people can wear more than one hat
@melonie mac go boom  ignore him. he smells calvinistic  which means he s worse than a progressive Christian. legitimate gnosticism infused into the church by augustine  and spewed by john calvin. truth is  I like your way of reaching out  and teaching better than his way of not doing either.
@sparkiet88  there s a distinction because there are historical  epistemological  methodological and theological developments.
as far as you know is the church any good  Imainly ask cause in wondering if a church having progressive things but still doing the Bible right is possible
this is unintentional comedy.
itshould be the on sunday
remember when Christianity said no gays but not its like we love love the gays
check psalms 91
I thought the woke movement hated Christianity  unless itsubmitted to them.
in the Bible itsays to obey God rather than men!
melonie I ll tell you the Lord s true name in the hebrew. its yahawashI from the tribe of judah. if you want true truth  go to a channel called gabar adama. and side note  no ads will never pop up in his videos like it did in youre video.
right  pharisees  left  sadauseces  Christ condemeded both.
Christians worldwide have had idols in their houses twice a year they call them Christian holidays but when you look at the roots of these holidays its frightening easter a cute bunny brings eggs look at the roots of this pagan holiday hare lays an egg a bird hatches from it flies into the sky bursts into flames and astarte is reborn and in the Bible itsays astarte is an enemy of God so now Christians worldwide have chocolate eggs thats an idol then Christmas is another pagan holiday celebrates the harvest with a fern tree and millions of Christians call it Christmas and put tree up every year thats another idol there are lots of holidays in the Bible the thing is God loves holidays  but most Christians just ignore them and celebrate pagan holidays instead its been going on for over a hundred years and most Christians dont relies what they are doing is wrong
curious....do you have criticism for the conservatives too or just progressives  askin for a friend  God bless
why does the church exist  for those below  or his will above
this conformism and other attacks on Christianity are insidious. this week its rosary beads  I agree  there can only be one source for all this ultimately...not crazy.
romans 1 17-27 nkjvfor the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all unGodliness and unrighteousness of men  who suppress the truth in unrighteousness. although they knew God  they did not glorify him as God  nor were thankful  but became futile in their thoughts  and their foolish hearts were darkened. professing to be wise  they became fools  and changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like corruptible man. therefore God also gave them up to uncleanness  in the lusts of their hearts  to dishonor their bodies among themselves. for this reason God gave them up to vile passions. for even their women exchanged the natural use for what is against nature. likewise also the men  leaving the natural use of the woman  burned in their lust for one another  men with men committing what is shameful  and receiving in themselves the penalty of their error which was due.
lol Christianity
9 00 - did you just call my governor the devil !   as an agnostic  I cannot argue with your observation  no evidence to say otherwise.
Im an atheist. but the way I see it is if I have to tolerate the mus slims the Christians are going to have to have the same pass.
conservatives did these for decades... now wokes are catching up atheist and proud of it
its nothing new they been doing this for years it gives some Christians a bad name
the Christ wasn t born today 2 000 years ago   Ive never been so confused.  hahaha
more and more each day itseems that if Jesus came back today that he would be ashamed of how no one is following his teachings and using his name and the name of God to commit acts of violence towards others. of how people who claim to love him and God have shown spread hate  lies  distrust and death to others. when they should be loving their neighbors  helping those who are poor  disenfranchised  blind  hungry  sick and diseased.today s religious crowd seem to just dont want to follow his teachings in words only and have replaced what he said to do with greed  envy  hate and the lust for money and power. Jesus would not be very happy about what he would see. and when someone call out the hypocritical nature of Christian s they get attacked and called names like non-believers  haters of religion and such. I believe that if Jesus came back today and started telling those who say they love and follow his teachings to feed the hungry  house the homeless  take care of the sick  love instead of hate that they would crucify him all over again. because it does not align with their current view and beliefs about his teachings.Jesus  commanments to all his followersmatthew 22 37 39   king james version  kjv 1900 37 Jesus said unto him  thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart  and with all thy soul  and with all thy mind. 38 this is the first and great commandment. 39 and the second is like unto it  thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.john 13 34-35 kjv34 a new commandment I give unto you  that ye love one another  as I have loved you  that ye also love one another.35 by this shall all men know that ye are my disciples  if ye have love one to another.matthew 5 42-4842 give to him that asketh thee  and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away. 43 ye have heard that it hath been said  thou shalt love thy neighbour  and hate thine enemy. 44 but I say unto you  love your enemies  bless them that curse you  do good to them that hate you  and pray for them which despitefully use you  and persecute you  45 that ye may be the children of your father which is in heaven  for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good  and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust. 46 for if ye love them which love you  what reward have ye  do not even the publicans the same  47 and if ye salute your brethren only  what do ye more than others  do not even the publicans so  48 be ye therefore perfect  even as your father which is in heaven is perfect.isaiah 58 10-1210 feed the hungry  and help those in trouble. then your light will shine out from the darkness  and the darkness around you will be as bright as noon. 11 the Lord will guide you continually  giving you water when you are dry and restoring your strength. you will be like a well-watered garden  like an ever-flowing spring.12 some of you will rebuild the deserted ruins of your cities. then you will be known as a rebuilder of walls and a restorer of homes.james 5 14 16 king james version14 is any sick among you  let him call for qthe elders of the church  and let them pray over him  ranointing him with oil in the name of the Lord  15 and sthe prayer of faith shall tsave the sick  and the Lord shall raise him up  and uif he have committed sins  they shall be forgiven him. 16 confess your faults one to another  and pray one for another  wthat ye may be healed.the effectual xyfervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.john 131 now before the feast of the passover  when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the father  having loved his own which were in the world  he loved them unto the end. 2 and supper being ended  the devil having now put into the heart of judas iscariot  simon s son  to betray him  3 Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands  and that he was come from God  and went to God  4 he riseth from supper  and laid aside his garments  and took a towel  and girded himself.5 after that he poureth water into a bason  and began to wash the disciples  feet  and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded. 6 then cometh he to simon peter  and peter saith unto him  Lord  dost thou wash my feet  7 Jesus answered and said unto him  what I do thou knowest not now  but thou shalt know hereafter. 8 peter saith unto him  thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him  if I wash thee not  thou hast no part with me. 9 simon peter saith unto him  Lord  not my feet only  but also my hands and my head. 10 Jesus saith to him  he that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet  but is clean every whit  and ye are clean  but not all. 11 for he knew who should betray him  therefore said he  ye are not all clean.12 so after he had washed their feet  and had taken his garments  and was set down again  he said unto them  know ye what I have done to you  13 ye call me master and Lord  and ye say well  for so I am. 14 if I then  your Lord and master  have washed your feet  ye also ought to wash one another s feet. 15 for I have given you an example  that ye should do as I have done to you. 16 verily  verily  I say unto you  the servant is not greater than his Lord  neither he that is sent greater than he thatsent him. 17 if ye know these things  happy are ye if ye do them.I wonder when todays Christians will adhere to these commandments given to us by Jesus
yes  Imade it clear in this video that politics and politicians are flawed in general  not just one side.
@melonie mac go boom  I would love to hear it as well bc to me its the same coin but a different side. every point you made can apply to conservatives as well! thank you for the clarity!  goboom
the Bible does instruct us to go to church  because fellowship will grow our faith. also matthew 18 20 kjv  for where two or three are gathered together in my name  there am I in the midst of them. church is for everyone  even if they are not saved they should be welcome if they are attending for respectful purposes. in terms of pastor  ushers  official members  etc though  those should have strict rules in place with who can be in such positions. but as far as regular attendees go  yes its for everyone. those already saved will grow in faith together  and those unsaved will hear God s word  which never goes void. isaiah 55 10-11 esv   for as the rain and the snow come down from heaven and do not return there but water the earth  making it bring forth and sprout  giving seed to the sower and bread to the eater  so shall my word be that goes out from my mouth  itshall not return to me empty  but itshall accomplish that which I purpose  and shall succeed in the thing for which I sent it.
I wonder what kind of Christianity was shown during capitol attack.
pretty sure Jesus is a monarch.
magical wizards in the sky need respect too!!
this is in revelations. mystery babylon aka the great harlot is apostate Christianity led by the papacy.
I dont progressivism should be conflated with wokeism tbh
of course they are. cant have nice things. commies always do this.
and yet... here you are casting stones. are you without sin matthew 5  judge not  lest you be judged  for the measure you hold unto others shall also be held unto you.
not in the eastern orthodox church.
to be fair. progressivism has been highjacking everything since the 1900s. even Christianity. alot of things churches and Christian culture espouses today aren t biblical. 60  of Christians dont read the Bible or misinterpret it. a big change in Christian culture by progressivism happened in the 60s-70s. there s too many to point out. but for example before the movie a thief in the night came out churches had a more biblical understanding of the end times. the current invasion by progressivism is more of pushing more of thier agenda. and like all progressive agendas in history it eventually fails gets exposed and is eventually discarded.
do you not know that the unjust will not inherit the kingdom of God  do not be deceived  neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers nor boy prostitutes  nor sodomites nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor robbers will inherit the kingdom of God. that is what some of you used to be  but now you have had yourselves washed  you were sanctified  you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the spirit of our God. 1 corinthians 6 9-11. the degenerates can have this world  the faithful will have the next.
did my comment get removed
its called modern Christianity and its really dangerous and blasphemous. the fact that they care more about the culture and less about the things of God  salvation etc.
man melodie looks ridic

the sabbath is not sunday  its from friday sunset to saturday sunset Im a Christian  and it baffles me when people say they follow the commandments but dont do the sabbath iv heard all the answers they say its my sabbath how insane thatsounds itsays in the commandments keep Gods day holy keep the seventh day holy and sunday is the first day of the week dont worry  Imight be wrong  but I dont believe I am we are in the end times everything in the revelations is happening now and most people either refuse to see it or dont believe it.  look at the dead sea its starting to renew fish are swimming is pools of water around it and in the Bible itsays the dead see will renew and have life in it in the end times  and its happening  but people still dont believe now elon musk is doing human trials putting microchips in the right hand and in their heads in the end times the mark of the beast will be on the right hand or on the forehead  but people still dont believe then it also says when the jewish people become a nation that will be the last generation until yeshua returns and israel became a nation in 1948 and people still dont believe. do these people who read the Bible these days miss out these parts  how can you not believe after seeing the proof in front of them
God did say the that devil will twist words of the Bible and will lead people astray and there a specials place in hell who mislead people and this wasn t the first time the devil tainted the church
I truly believe that these sjw s are the angels that fell with lucifer
yeah but woke isnt liberal
I just hate that people still think of Jesus as a white man.
the devil shown me the truth of Christ  he is the way to the father and eternal damnation is to choose of your free will to not follow him. to follow the one true God is the meaning
good old-fashioned communism. it didn t die after the collapse of the soviet union  it just went into a type of hibernation. sometimes I think those captain america movies were telling us something indirectly regarding hydra. by the way  I love those captain america movies  lol. pretty entertaining.
@dying rose  haven t seen them.
@nathanstein  check  em out. I think they were the highlight of the marvel era personally.
perhaps  but not from me. sadly youtube filters comments even when I untick the box
I didn t know liberalism is a us-limited political term. next you ll claim you guys invented it
do Christians and jews and   other  non-muslims go to heaven   quran 2 62   those who believe  in the quran  and those who follow the jewish  scriptures  and the Christians and the sabians- any - who believe in God and the last day  and work righteousness  shall have their reward with their Lord  on them shall be no fear nor shall they grieve.  ie on judgement day  note  the idea of  salvation  in islam is here made conditional upon three elements only  1   belief in God  2   belief in the day of judgment  3  righteous action in life.  according to the quran Christians and jews worship true God   quran 3 113-114    not all of them are alike  of the people of the book  ie Christians and jews   are a portion thatstand  for the right  they rehearse the signs of God all night long  and they prostrate themselves in adoration. they believe in God and the last day  they enjoin what is right  and forbid what is wrong  and they hasten  in emulation  in  all  good works  they are in the ranks of the righteous.  note  according to the quran that Jesus is not God nevertheless Christians still worship one true God.    allah  is the protector of  monasteries  churches  synagogues and the mosques  quran 22 40 they are  those who have been evicted from their homes without right - only because they say    our Lord is God   and were it not that God checks the people  some by means of others  there would have been demolished monasteries  churches  synagogues  and mosques in which the name of God is much mentioned. and God will surely support those who support him. indeed  God is powerful and exalted in might.note  why did allah protected churches and synagogues if they worship false allah     why  are there so many different religions in the world    quran 5 48  ...... if God wanted he could have made all of you a single nation.  ie single religion   but he willed otherwise in order to test you in what he has given you  ie scriptures  therefore try to excel one another in good deeds. ultimately you all shall return to God then he will show you the truth of those matters in which you     dispute   note quran 3 85     if anyone desires a religion other than islam   ie  submission  to God   never will it be accepted of him and in the hereafter he will be in the ranks of those who have lost   ie entry into heaven  my explanation of above versethe word islam is a   verb   not noun like other religionsislam mean  submission  to God  the above verse saying is that God will not accept a religion from the  muslim  and the non-muslims but total  submission  to God  question  how can muslim and the non-muslim  submit  to the God answer  be kind to other human beings and do not lie  do not steal  do not cheat  do not hurt others  do not be prideful and do the charity work.note  if you obeyed all the above allah-God s moral laws  you  submitted to God.  ie islam mean  submission  to God  the only people who will enter paradise those who    submitted to God      ie by good deeds  God does not accept your religion of birth but only   your total   submission to him.   God allows interfaith marriages and eat food from the Christian and jew and vice versa  quran 5 5  this day  all  good foods have been made lawful  and the food of those who were given the scripture  ie Christian and jew  is lawful for you and your food is lawful for them. and lawful in marriage are chaste women from among the believers  ie muslim   and chaste women from among those who were given the scripture  ie Christian and jew  before you  when you have given them their due compensation  desiring chastity not unlawful sexual intercourse or taking  secret  lovers. and whoever denies the faith - his work has become worthless and he in the hereafter will be among the losers.   note    only   islam allows interfaith marriages   14 hundreds   years ago. today even sunnImuslim and shia muslim do not marry each-other.    shame    muslim  Christian  jew and all the other human being worship the    same God    with their own ancestral-inherent understand of God  quran 29 46   and do not argue with Christian and jew except in a way that is best  except for those who commit injustice among them  and say   we believe in that which has been revealed to us and revealed to you.  and our God and your God is one   and we are muslims  in submission  to him. note  God is God of all- every humans not just abrahimic faiths. it will be a shirk to set up a God for others. God answered prayed regardless of anyone religion.all the world major religions came from  same God  but they are  all corrupt  more or less  some more than others  from their original foundational teaching. the older religion are more corrupted than newer religion.question to muslim and Christian    does God   allah only answer your pray   and God   allah does not answer non muslim   non Christian pray did allah    canceled    all other religions judaism and Christianity quran 5 48     and we have revealed to you  o muhammad  the book in truth  confirming that which preceded it of the scripture   ie new and old testament   and as a criterion over it. so judge between them by what allah has revealed and do not follow their inclinations away from what has come to you of the truth.    to each of you we prescribed a law and a method    had allah willed  he would have made you   one nation     ie single religion   but  he intended  to test you in what he has given you  so race to  all that is  good. to allah-God is your return all together  and he will  then  inform you concerning that over which you used to   differ  .  note  judaism  Christianity and other religion are valid path to God.  allah says to jew to follow old testament  not  the quran and not to follow the prophet muhammad   allah says   quran 5 43     and how do they   ie jew   make you   ie muhammad   a   judge   while they have the old testament wherein is allah s judgement  .....  what is the      quranic      ruling regarding the fate of non muslims  quran 4 123   paradise is not  obtained  by your      ie muslim  wishful thinking   nor   by that of the people of the scripture   ie Christian and jew   whoever does a wrong will be recompensed for it  and he will not find besides God a protector or a helper.question to sunnImuslim do you believe only muslim go to heaven and which sunnI sect of muslim go to heaven    there are many sunnImuslim sects    hanafI  shafI  hanbalI  malikI  salafI  sufI   etc did allah chooses you to be born in muslim family or it was your choice  did non-muslim chose to be born in non-muslim family  muslim you are going to heaven not because you chose islam to be your religion but because you born in muslim family.... correct  non-muslim will go to hellfire because they born in non-muslim family.... correct it is fair for non-muslim to find truth outside their religion to go to heaven while you dont    you    must    know how to become   qualified   for to enter paradise   on the day of judgement God will   not   judge humanity bases on sunnImuslim sect vs shia muslim sect   nor   by muslim vs non-muslim  but  doer of goods vs doer of evils.    your   birth in the muslim s family is not a    qualification   for to enter the paradise.    your   religion   sect   foot long beard is not a    qualification   for to enter the paradise.the   qualification   to enter paradise is   faith in God and good work  . quran 41 30  surely those who say    our Lord is God   and then remain steadfast  the angels descend upon them saying do not fear nor grieve. rather  rejoice in the good news of paradise  which you have been promised  note  on the day of judgement angels will gives good news of paradise to those who did good deeds to    calm    you down so you do not panic.in the sight of allah atheist and non-muslim are equal in deeds   atheist in the quran  quran 25 44    or do you think that most of them hear or reason  they are not except like livestock. rather  they are  even  more astray in  their  way.     Christians in the quran  quran 5 82  .....and you will find the nearest in love to the believers  ie muslims  those who say    we are Christians   that is because amongst them are priests and monks and they do not behave proudly   Christians  atheists  rapists  killers and shia-muslim destined to hellfire all together   ethiopian s Christian king najashI who   saved   early muslims lives will he go to hell abu talib who protected the prophet of allah will he go to hell abu lahab  pharaoh  satan and prophet muhammad s beloved mother aminah  will be in hellfire... correct  explain to me why does prophet s mother deserved hellfire  she died before her son s prophet-hood.I am 100  sure if prophet s mother lives to see her son prophet-hood she would have accepted islam.your mother will enter heaven and your prophet s mother will enter hellfire.my final conclusion the    basic    message of God to the human is that    you    believe in God and be kind to other human beings   animals and in the returned God will reward you with a new life in paradise.  the quran only guides you how to become a good human being  nothing else .  you are a good  human being or a bad human being that is your choice.  no one can force you to become a good human being.  you must work hard to become a good human being.  why  should   you   do good deeds and avoid bad deeds   do good - its for you. do bad - its against you.     your   life is a test from God that you will choose to do either good or bad.  find the excuse to help others and forgive others not the other way around.     your    final destination is either hell or heaven.  so work hard toward choice of  your destination.quran 17 7  if you do good  you will do so for your own good. and if you do evil  it will be to your own loss. b
romans 1 25-27 king james version25  who changed the truth of God into a lie  and worshipped and served the creature more than the creator  who is blessed for ever. amen.26 for this cause God gave them up unto vile affections  for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature 27 and likewise also the men  leaving the natural use of the woman  burned in their lust one toward another  men with men working that which is unseemly  and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.leviticus 18 22 king james version22 thou shalt not lie with mankind  as with womankind  it is abomination. leviticus 20 13 king james version13 if a man also lie with mankind  as he lieth with a woman  both of them have committed an abomination  they shall surely be put to death  their blood shall be upon them 1 corinthians 6 9-10 king james version9 know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God  be not deceived  neither fornicators  nor idolaters  nor adulterers  nor effeminate  nor abusers of themselves with mankind 10 nor thieves  nor covetous  nor drunkards  nor revilers  nor extortioners  shall inherit the kingdom of God. 1 timothy 1 10 king james version10 for whoremongers  for them that defile themselves with mankind  for menstealers  for liars  for perjured persons  and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine
I sure hope Christianity goes away during my life time
Jesus is a revolutionary not a liberal
only issue is how can you support the right when you are a woman  wouldnt you want access to abortions
the Bible s answer  Jesus  opposers accused him of making himself equal to God.  john 5 18  10 30-33  however  Jesus never claimed to be on the same level as almighty God. he said   the father is greater than I am.  john 14 28.  Jesus  early followers did not view him as being equal to almighty God. for example  the apostle paul wrote that after Jesus was resurrected  God  exalted him  Jesus  to a superior position.  obviously  paul did not believe that Jesus was almighty God. otherwise  how could God exalt Jesus to a superior position   philippians 2 9.
you not reading the Bible if you think the mirror of God is God
wait Jesus was a liberal    so can we finally squash abortion    you know since y all follow his teachings now
well  Im an atheist. I dont use or need  Jesus  or any other God for anything. I take responsibility for my actions. I dont need an imaginary friend to praise for my fortune or a boogie man to blame my mistakes on.
or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God  do not be deceived  neither the sexually immoral  nor idolaters  nor adulterers  effeminate  nor homosexuals...none will inherit the kingdom of God. - 1 corinthians chapter 6 verse 9 I know that the newest  updated  edition of the new revised standard version says do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of God  do not be deceived! the sexually immoral  idolaters  adulterers  male prostitutes  men who engage in illicitsex...none of these will inherit the kingdom of God. what does the international standard version say  the isv says that you know that wicked people will not inherit the kingdom of God  dont you  stop deceiving yourselves! sexually immoral people  idolaters  adulterers  male prostitutes  homosexuals...will not inherit the kingdom of God. seems to me that they are trying to get more people into the church by changing stuff.
Im a progressive and I think believeing in any kind of invisible sky God. weather its Christian muslim jewish or whatever is dumb and nonsensical.
in islam Jesus is God s mighty prophet. God send him to teach humans the humanity. he is the child of mother mary and has no father. this was from God s miracle. just like God create adam and eve.and they both have no father and mother. check out in Bible the Jesus never says that I am a God and worship me. however Jesus said that my father sent me to humans how to pray to God.
Jesus was black btw
I think you shoud try to stay in your church and not let the progressives taking over  talk to your priest your bishop  talk to other members of the congregation   just walk way is the easy way
most Christians forget that all Lord and savior Jesus Christ is the king of kings he is coming the wicked will be destroyed the Bible also teaches that we have to be aware of people that are teaching false doctrine progressive Christianity is a wolf in sheep s clothing it is not of God romans ephesians and corinthians teaches these things and how to watch out for it my favorite chapter is first corinthians 15 the whole chapter has a lot of doctrine and teachings there we have to remember we re living in the last days end of time this was prophesied to come in revelation and daniel we are seeing the great apostasy of our generation unfolding we seeing the wickedness of our government they are now going after conservative Christians the ones that follow Christ are being attacked right and left here in the united states and around the world by progressive movements that is the antiChrist church the time been paid for tribulations is now spiritually mentally and physically with our faith in God and following Jesus Christ we will be saved we will have to endure tribulations as followers of Christ we need to unite and keep the word of God and help those who are struggling the day of the second coming of our Lord and savior Jesus Christ me and you will see it one day all the millennial generation and generation z will see the coming of our Lord and savior Jesus Christ some of us will be saved others will be destroyed we have to be faithful and keep God s commandments
Jesus was a libertarian. discuss.
so I haven t seen a video of melonies in years no particular reason just stopped watching and I come back to a antI  woke  no true scotsman fallacy about progressive Christians and culture war nonsense. can say Im disappointed not for your belief in Christ but the rest Imentioned.
Jesus was definitely left  and he wasn t real.
they ve been trying to hijack Christianity for a while now. we got pastors trying to make excuses for lgbt sins and saying that Jesus was wrong about specific things. its blasphemy. these people need to repent.
let your will be done.you are very well responsible for your actions.without Jesus  who paid in behalf of everyone s sins  you have to pay it yourself in eternal damnation.
Jesus is God and does not fall under any political side  he is above it all
@dennis the menace  first of all you cant compare all right leaning Christians or centrist Christians like me to the capitol rioters. not all of us were behind those idiots. secondly  even if you were a liberal and a Christian  which isn t a bad thing  are you still preaching the gospel  are you following or at least attempting to live by the rules of the Bible  or are you bending the knee to everything this world is doing that isn t of Christ  yes the Bible calls us to love and respect others. not to hate. but that doesnt mean we have to accept all their sins and cater to their desires. Im a non-white Christian myself too. progressive Christianity isn t real Christianity.
@jcg s lounge   I have edited my above comment. 2nd you may not politically support white nationalist or not  if you do it politically then your stance of not supporting of white Christian nationalist already cancels out. its like saying  I dont support hate for jews but I vote of nazI hitler.
lol time moves on and things change. get over it.
Jesus isn t God. he s the son of God.
imagine listening to a woman on matters of Christ
this progressive crap worms its way in when there s a void in mentoring and discipleship. sound theology is based on scripture  not feelings. also  plot twist  Jesus is an absolute monarchist. he s the king of kings and Lord of Lords. and when he returns  he s going to sit on the throne of king david.
would you dare to remove all your tattoos to save Christianity
Jesus is not God.  Jesus is a story.
Jesus was the first liberal.  deal with it.
Christianity is make believe to begin with.. when you play make believe you can play however you want..
Jesus is not God but God s only begotten son
why would anyone even bother with something as transparently fraudulent as Christianity
what s thatsupposed to mean  women cant tell the truth about Jesus or have good knowledge on him or something
lol
@drsw36  that guy is crazy.
Jesus is God too. the trinity. john 10  30  the father and I are one.
Jesus is God. Jesus said if you have seen him you have seen the father. Jesus and God are one.
@melonie mac go boom  Bible questions answeredis the trinity doctrine in the Bible the Bible s answer  many Christian denominations teach that God is a trinity. however  note what the encyclop dia britannica states   neither the word trinity nor the explicit doctrine appears in the new testament . . . the doctrine developed gradually over several centuries and through many controversies.
@pix lax  its not the word trinity. its the concept of the trinity.  read the gospels which describes the human nature of God and God in the flesh. avoid commentaries   read the main source for yourself.
@melonie mac go boom  the trinity comes from babylon the great get out of her  my people  if you do not want to share with her in her sins  and if you do not want to receive part of her plagues.  rev. 18 4.
@melonie mac go boom  I am Bible scholar for life I like you melonie  mac and hope you find the true God before its too late sweetie just ask Jesus for the truth only then with you see the sacred secret of God!.
@teemo league  lol satan has you the trinity came from bable tower queen of heaven babylonian Goddess ishtar  astarte you are being misled
@pix lax  watch tower org has a horrible translation. with better greek interpretation and advanced linguistic application. we can see who is on the wrong side. jws didn t age well in this century.
@pix lax  how are you going to use the encyclopaedia britannica as your primary source over the Bible itself
@teemo league  I am a Bible scholar I can read all Bibles there is no watch tower Bible you mean new world translation and the only thing changed is the name jehovah has been put back after the king james took it out if you still think Jesus is God then watch and see your out come king james Bible psalm83 -18 that men may know that thou  whose name alone is jehovah  art the most high over all the earth.
@sparkiet88  still no trinity in the Bible not one of them - king james version revelation22 -19and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy  God shall take away his part out of the book of life  and out of the holy city  and from the things which are written in this book.
@pix lax  from john 1   1 in the beginning was the word  and the word was with God  and the word was God. 2 he was with God in the beginning. 3 through him all things were made  without him nothing was made that has been made. 4 in him was life  and that life was the light of all mankind. 5 the light shines in the darkness  and the darkness has not overcome it.
@sparkiet88  1  in the beginning was the word   and the word was with God   and the word was a God  small g  you think what you wont but it is God who makes it grow and Jesus who defends the wholeheartedly to the one true God jehovah
@pix lax  except that isn t how greek grammar works  it a little too complicated for a you tube comment but you cant just add an  a  where was none the and it completely changes the sentence structure just because you want it to  also the fact this aryanism heresy is completely at odds with the rest of scripture. see   matthew 1 22-23    all this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet   the virgin will conceive and give birth to a son  and they will call him immanuel   which means  God with us  . john 20 28    thomas said to him   my Lord and my God! romans 9 5    theirs are the patriarchs  and from them is traced the human ancestry of the messiah  who is God over all  forever praised! amen. colossians 2 9    for in Christ all the fullness of the deity lives in bodily form  1 john 5 20    we know also that the son of God has come and has given us understanding  so that we may know him who is true. and we are in him who is true by being in his son Jesus Christ. he is the true God and eternal life.
@sparkiet88  lol do you not know what a Bible scholar is
@pix lax  appeal to authority fallacy
@sparkiet88  matthew7 19-23 every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down  and cast into the fire.20  wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.21  not every one thatsaith unto me  Lord  Lord  shall enter into the kingdom of heaven  but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven.22  many will say to me in that day  Lord  Lord  have we not prophesied in thy name  and in thy name have cast out devils  and in thy name done many wonderful works 23  and then will I profess unto them  I never knew you  depart from me  ye that work iniquity.
@pix lax  ephesians 2 8-108 for it is by grace you have been saved  through faith and this is not from yourselves  it is the gift of God  9 not by works  so that no one can boast. 10 for we are God s handiwork  created in Christ Jesus to do good works  which God prepared in advance for us to do.romans 3 2828 for we maintain that a person is justified by faith apart from the works of the law.galatians 2 1616 know that a person is not justified by the works of the law  but by faith in Jesus Christ. so we  too  have put our faith in Christ Jesus that we may be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the law  because by the works of the law no one will be justified.romans 321 but now apart from the law the righteousness of God has been made known  to which the law and the prophets testify. 22 this righteousness is given through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe. there is no difference between jew and gentile  23 for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God  24 and all are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus. 25 God presented Christ as a sacrifice of atonement  through the shedding of his blood to be received by faith. he did this to demonstrate his righteousness  because in his forbearance he had left the sins committed beforehand unpunished  26 he did it to demonstrate his righteousness at the present time  so as to be just and the one who justifies those who have faith in Jesus.romans 116 and if by grace  then it cannot be based on works  if it were  grace would no longer be grace.titus 211 for the grace of God has appeared that offers salvation to all people. 12 it teaches us to say  no  to unGodliness and worldly passions  and to live self-controlled  upright and Godly lives in this present age  13 while we wait for the blessed hope the appearing of the glory of our great God and savior  Jesus Christ  14 who gave himself for us to redeem us from all wickedness and to purify for himself a people that are his very own  eager to do what is good.
@sparkiet88  james2 -20 but wilt thou know  o vain man  that faith without works is dead
@sparkiet88 james2 - 18  yea  a man may say  thou hast faith  and I have works  shew me thy faith without thy works  and I will shew thee my faith by my works.

@sparkiet88  if you dont know the version of the Bible how can you trust it I use them all to set things strait not just one.
@sparkiet88  got it new international version
@sparkiet88  let them know that you  whose name is the Lord     that you alone are the most high over all the earth.psalm 83 18 and by the way Lord is not a name your Bible has jahovah taken out simple as that look up old king james version its plain as day  that men may know that thou  whose name alone is jehovah  art the most high over all the earth.psalm 83 18 king james version
@pix lax  took you long enough to figure out what version of the Bible it was being a Bible scholar and all. and to be clear the words I posted were from niv but I am happy to read just about any version  the message is normally the same. but jehovah comes from the hebrew consonants of yh w v h  and the hebrew vowels from the word adonaI  the last person alive to know what the real vowels were died in the time of alexander the great  when people were afraid to say the name of God out loud so they used a a substitute  so we can be sure that jehovah isn t the name of God because it is the only word that came into existences from the people who refused to say his name. so if you are going to base your faith on calling God the right name  at least you could use the generally agreed on more hebrew accurate name of yahweh.
@sparkiet88  now translate name of yahweh to english
took me 20 mins for your replies then I just look it up I have no need to prove my credentials I use all you use one and a bad one at that
@sparkiet88  took me 20 mins for your replies then I just look it up I have no need to prove my credentials I use all you use one and a bad one at that
@pix lax  there is no translation  as mentioned above jehovah doesnt come from yahweh  but adonaI vowels.
@pix lax  nope  try again  but thanks for playing

@pix lax  I dont see why I should have to tell you  first off you called me a liar  you have only presented gotcha arguments  so if I tell you are just going to try and attack me with it  you have not addressed any of the points I have presented  you only change topics or move the goal posts. first off I am a Christian. I believe in one God  the father  the almighty  maker of heaven and earth  of all that is  seen and unseen.I believe in one Lord  Jesus Christ  the only son of God  eternally begotten of the father  God from God  light from light  true God from true God  begotten  not made  of one being with the father. through him all things were made. for us and for our salvation  he came down from heaven  was incarnate of the holy spirit and the virgin mary  and became fully human. for our sake he was crucified under pontius pilate. he suffered death and was buried. on the third day he rose again in accordance with the scriptures. he ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the father. he will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead  and his kingdom will have no end.I believe in the holy spirit  the Lord  the giver of life  who proceeds from the father and the son  who in unity with the father and the son is worshiped and glorified  who has spoken through the prophets. I believe in one holy Christian and apostolic church. I acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.I look for the resurrection of the dead and the life of the world to come. amen.whoever wishes to be saved must  above all else  hold to the true Christian faith. whoever does not keep this faith pure in all points will certainly perish forever.now this is the true Christian faith  we worship one God in three persons and three persons in one God  without mixing the persons or dividing the divine being. for each person the father  the son  and the holy spirit is distinct  but the deity of father  son  and holy spirit is one  equal in glory and coeternal in majesty. what the father is  so is the son  and so is the holy spirit. the father is uncreated  the son uncreated  the holy spirit uncreated  the father is infinite  the son infinite  the holy spirit infinite  the father is eternal  the son eternal  the holy spirit eternal  yet they are not three who are eternal  but there is one who is eternal  just as they are not three who are uncreated  nor three who are infinite  but there is one who is uncreated and one who is infinite. in the same way the father is almighty  the son is almighty  and the holy spirit is almighty  yet they are not three who are almighty  but there is one who is almighty. so the father is God  the son is God  the holy spirit is God  yet they are not three Gods  but one God. so the father is Lord  the son is Lord  the holy spirit is Lord  yet they are not three Lords  but one Lord. for just as Christian truth compels us to confess each person individually to be God and Lord  so the true Christian faith forbids us to speak of three Gods or three Lords. the father is neither made nor created nor begotten of anyone. the son is neither made nor created  but is begotten of the father alone. the holy spirit is neither made nor created nor begotten  but proceeds from the father and the son. so there is one father  not three fathers  one son  not three sons  one holy spirit  not three holy spirits. and within this trinity none comes before or after  none is greater or inferior  but all three persons are coequal and coeternal  so that in every way  as stated before  all three persons are to be worshiped as one God and one God worshiped as three persons. whoever wishes to be saved must have this conviction of the trinity.it is furthermore necessary for eternal salvation truly to believe that our Lord Jesus Christ also took on human flesh. now this is the true Christian faith  we believe and confess that our Lord Jesus Christ  God s son  is both God and man. he is God  eternally begotten from the nature of the father  and he is man  born in time from the nature of his mother  fully God  fully man  with rational soul and human flesh  equal to the father as to his deity  less than the father as to his humanity  and though he is both God and man  Christ is not two persons but one  one  not by changing the deity into flesh  but by taking the humanity into God  one  indeed  not by mixture of the natures  but by unity in one person  for just as the rational soul and flesh are one human being  so God and man are one Christ. he suffered for our salvation  descended into hell  rose the third day from the dead. he ascended into heaven  is seated at the right hand of God the father almighty  and from there he will come to judge the living and the dead. at his coming all people will rise with their own bodies to answer for their personal deeds. those who have done good will enter eternal life  but those who have done evil will go into eternal fire.this is the true Christian faith. whoever does not faithfully and firmly believe this cannot be saved.have a nice day  Jesus loves you.
@sparkiet88  a true cristian does not attack argue or play games we should have love each other God and his son Jesus peace to you brother sister
