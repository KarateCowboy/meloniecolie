hello from the navajo nation  just wanted to say Ive been a fan for years now. keep up the great content melonie  youre my hero
Im native and what are they exactly saying is appropriated   simply because the characters are wearing leather-like buckskin    lol or because the main character uses a bow   lol well  everyone around the world used bows and arrows.  also  it isn t like the game is actually ripping off anything specific to any particular tribal nation.  any native  culture  used in the game is incredibly generalized and very watered down.  much like a watery  tasteless soup.  no harm  no foul.
in majority of cases cultural  appropriation  is in fact cultural appreciation
ugh so sick of these culture gatekeepers  just let em make the story the way they want it. coming from an indigenous!
thank you so much melonie for the shout out!  its very much appreciated.  youreally turned around my crappy week.  thank you for being a genuinely kind person.  we need more people like you.  God bless!
as a native american  I can honestly say...1  Im not offended  d2  Im looking forward to playing this game  d3  woke people are the reason why we cant have nice things  i
aloy is a redhead  as a brit I am now offended on behalf of all celtic nations. someone needs to pay me royalties or something.
Im a native american and Im not offended.
the whole thing about cultural appropriation is just an attempt at control. cultures grow organically. by someone taking something and adding a little twist is how cultures grow. culture a shares cool stuff  culture b says  hey thats cool let me try and share with my friends and use it to inspire our other stuff . culture b brings their newly inspired stuff back to culture a. culture a  hey I like your take on this it gives me an idea for this traditional piece I was working on. you can see the history of all this stuff from art to cloths to food in cultures all over the world.I saw an interview with a native american artist  he was concerned cause there are white people who like his work  cloths jewellery  and would like to wear his stuff. but they obviously cant because the usual suspects will demonize or worse those white people for doing so. this artist now is cut off of millions of possible customers and contributing his cultures art to the world.
completely agree with you  mel. and you are so right about aloy being a mary sue. I ll always love classic lara for not being one of those. a chaotic neutral alignment is way more fun  the ultimate free spirits!
as a reservation-born mixed native myself  and coincidentally half irish   I share the opinion that native-inspired imagery out there in the world is pretty cool.  when I was a child  one of my favorite bugs bunny cartoon characters was  injun joe.   he has the sun-kissed red skin  the big nose  perhaps a tomahawk.  he was also a total badass.  maybe not the best representation of native culture but every time his episodes came on  I was super excited.  the audacity of people to be offended on my behalf.  smh .
youreally do this well. I see improvements from just a week ago. also shows you are having fun and not being sooo serious. great show today and yes its very frustrating. so many things I grew up with in calI are gone and forgotten  sometimes it makes me just sad. as long we have people like you and jeremy  there is hope to break the woke!
hello melonie. I just wanted to tell you how refreshing it is to see a young woman like yourself have such strong morals and values. as someone thats a good generation ahead of you  it gives me hope for our future to see younger people like you are still in the world today. keep doing your thing and you ll go far.
I think this is absolutely awesome. it is simply incredible that your culture is shared or is an object of inspiration. there might be people who would like to know more about this culture after they ve seen how incredible it is. it helps spreading the knowledge.
I actually love the world and designs of the armor and I always thought it was very respectful of the cultural inspirations. keep up the great content and keep up the awesomeness.
these situations are strange because  in my experience  I have yet to meet a live person who agrees with the talking heads online about their culture. Im in canada and we dont use the term  native american  but  indigenous   and one of my best friends is indigenous and he absolutely loves the horizon series. as a student of culture I really enjoy references too. Im sure its unintended  but when youread the word tenakth it reminded me of the hebrew name for the old testament  tanakh . if you played through shin megamI tenseI v  my first smt experience   you would have noted a multitude of cultural references  not the least of which was the name da at  I dont think this is a spoiler since it happens in the very early game . what you might not know is that its actually a hebrew word meaning  knowledge.  I wont say any more for risk of spoilers  but I think Ive made my point. we have all been influenced by a multitude of cultures. by paying homage to them  I think we actually honor them  not misappropriate them. it can beautiful  if you dont shoehorn a hostile agenda into these creative experiences.
Im loving the daily content  appreciating all your hard work. keep it up
preach on sister!!! thats why your channel is blowing up!!! woke culture....why do we suffer for their idiocracy!!!
as someone who s searching for a new job in the gaming industry  let me answer  yes  its part of the hiring process  yes  they measure your wokeness  yes  they will search your social media looking for  dangerous  thoughts. so  to sum it up  yep.
I love you mel for having this channel  3 its soooooo entertaining and also educative  im mexican   irish and also hate when anything that represents or gets close to those cultures is attacked or  cancelled  ..like wth  if its not offensive in any way  why go after it
aw shucks  thank you so much      3
hey ak is grandmother is from the nation and so is my aunt and cousins  ak is
in europe we alsoo had stone point arows in the stone age. in europe we had a stone age  with stone tools   tipI s and the whole animal hide clothing. so why do native americans aproppreiate my culture lol
@cornelius antonius       every single thread you say the same thing. curious.
@vladimir chernikov  because it is the truth
wouldn t you appreciate a game showcasing native american culture anyway  so long as it isn t being mocked or insulted  Imean  I dont know a single european who s upset or angry over dark souls culturally appropriating their culture.
there is nothing I can say that is specific to american natives. from bows  to tatoos  to wearking animal skin. germanic tribes  cavemens  africantribes  up to vikings. there are some things common to humanity  and what they do here is neither scientific  very small minded and misinformation at its best. thank you for speaking out.
exactly.
@thomas k  I understand what youre saying  and when it comes to most of what youre referring to  then youre correct.  however  native culture is far deeper  and far more varied than what is exposed to mainstream society.  take into consideration that each tribal nation had and has its own language  religion  customs  ceremonies  beliefs  stories  superstitions  diets  specific tattoo designs  war paint designs  songs  dances  and even games.  there s far more to culture than just the way one dresses and what weapons are used.
what tribe are your native parents from
@bud389  dark souls heavily borrows  certain european cultures but  the characters are mostly white. horizin borrows from native american culture but  the characters are mostly white.you see the obvious difference now
I would very much like to play a game where I am a powerful  european country that discovers america and we get to role play the colonization of america again  that would be a great game  then you could have all of the relevant europeans and native tribes fighting over the land and fighting with each other. make it multiplayer and nobody can win until every member of the enemy is wiped from the continent.
@manmanopoly 804  tuscarora and my clan is wolf.
true! if anything  their claim of cultural appropriation in this when its so vague and general in the game only paints the complainers as pretty ignorant. like just because they kinda sorta look like a native culture  they are so dumb lol
@manmanopoly 804   horizin borrows from native american culture but  the characters are mostly white.you see the obvious difference now   - how does it borrow from native american culture  bows  living in tents  and wearing hide and leather clothing is not uniquely native american  so what specifically is it taking from them also  last I checked  final fantasy borrows heavily from european culture and has plenty of japanese characters in it. I can keep this up all day and night till the end of time you know.
@bud389  I think there s been some sort of misunderstanding somewhere because I agree with you.
the samI people in scandinavia will make these people keep over.
there is also a lot of similarities to the kit worn by the northern picts of scotland  the headdress item I saw is very island or mayan  much of the art is african. to me as a anthropology hobbyist  not a professional but keener than most  it looks very globally inclusive.. makes sense in a modern world post-apocalypse.
@argobot  these people can not see beyond usa  even when said country is gone
@argobot  yep  tbh it is a great depiction of what society could look like after the fall of civilization. since we re basically a global multiculture it would be people borrowing from their old cultures to use for the new world
there are some aspects of a few of the outfits in zero dawn that resemble a mixture of both native american and japanese styles. though they are never a spitting image of native american decorations  decor  and craftmanship they bear some resemblance. either way I am happy to see my culture be shown in the game even if it is a piece of another tribe. I would like to see what could be created if they learned closer toward the japanese styles though as I feel like that would create some truly spectacular designs for some of the groups. none of the people are viewed as dumb of savage though especially since they can fight 8 foot machines with bows and arrows.
whatever happened to imitation being the sincerestist form of flattery
my brother actually learned making sushI from a sushImaster in japan for more than 6 years. it took him years to get even accepted and now he should stop making sushI because of this nonense! if would say if a sushImaster is proud to release you from his apprenticeship and you have his blessing to work on your own there is nothing to be ashamed of. quite the opposite.
@thomas k  exactly! if he has learned to do it and such that is appreciation. appropriation is defined as taking something for one s own use without owner s permission. your brother took the time to learn it because he appreciated and was interested in it.
@thomas k  sushI is not japanese though  it was introduced to japan by norwegians.
@theamazingjoker  while japan is certainly the sushI capital of the world   and responsible for introducing the dish to travelers   sushI traces its origins back to a chinese dish called narezushi. this dish consisted of fermented rice and salted fish. and  despite what you may think  it wasn t fermented and salted for flavor
in europe we had a stone age  with stone tools   tipI s and the whole animal hide clothing. so why do native americans aproppreiate my culture lol
I see some of my culture used in stories and games and I have no issue with it. it is fake  it is the writer s character or setting and I dont care. it is fiction and even if things are exaggerated that is sort of what stories do to reality  make it more interesting.I dont want to read a book  play a game  or watch a movie from people who only write about things they personal have the cultural  authority  to write about. would make for some pretty boring entertainment.
@nate  in europe we had a stone age  with stone tools   tipI s and the whole animal hide clothing. so why do native americans aproppreiate my culture lol
big hugs  thank you for linking me this article!
in europe we had a stone age  with stone tools   tipI s and the whole animal hide clothing. so why do native americans apropriate my culture lol
aho absolutely bubbly
you are correct
well Im a redhead with freckles  not really  and Im offended for all us gingers.
it makes no sense to be. if someone got inspired by the cultural heritage founded by your ancestors  thats a compliment and a sign of appreciation.at the end of the day  most of us want our cultures to be remembered and passed along to future generations. so the more people that do it  even if some only do it in small parts  the better.Im scandinavian  and it always makes me happy to see when people use norse mythology and the history of the vikings as inspiration for their art and fiction. sure  its not always historically accurate  but thats just nitpicking to me.the fact that people outside of my ethnic group thought the history of my ancestors was a good inspiration is just downright endearing.
@dethtones  ngl I thought you were serious at first
in europe we had a stone age  with stone tools   tipI s and the whole animal hide clothing. so why do native americans apropriate my culture lol
not too many people admit it though xd she is clearly a mary sue but at least is not a complete negative to me. the story was handle well enough for me to forget that fact. but yes we need to go back to more neutral characters and not the  savior  type of character that does everything for the greater good. I feel the developers rather play itsave with the protagonists lately  no matter the gender.
did you know they once got rid of speedy gonzales because of  muh mexican stereotypes   they brought him back because hispanics were outraged that they got rid of him  which I think is awesome.
that really means a lot  thank you so much
they complain about gamers gate keeping people yet they re fine with gate keeping. its always been their way or the highway
@cornelius antonius  commenting on every thread  I see.
@vladimir chernikov  yup
keep up the great work melonie. Im happy you made this channel.
lol  anyone in a post apocalypse world would almost certainly go to a tribal setting  because its literally human history.
normally Im not a fan of daily upload channels except hours and thequartering who is the one that introduced me to your channel. keep up the great work!
the fact that journa writes  humans have been pushed back to the stone age or something  is a huge flag that they haven t even remotely touched these games.edit - I think its worth noting that if thats all the have to complain about  then forbidden west is going to be a pretty good game. early reviews are very positive.
excellent vod  mel! I was going to suggest this topic. Im happy someone did. the wokies and overly offended are seriously getting on my last nerve! they ruin everything for everyone! Im more of a city boy and indoors person  but Im seriously considering on moving to the woods and live in a cabin! screw society! who s with me ! we can build a bunch of cabins  an underground bunker linking them  and a farm among other things.
when someone else s group gets some european diversity thats a bad thing its  cultural appropriation  when the Lord of the rings get s diversity thats just  social justice .
I started playing the first game a year ago and replayed it just before this one came out.  I loved the story to the point to ask when are we going to make a movie about this.  alloy felt like a person which goal was to find out where she came from and someone who had flaws and wasn t the best at everything. at the end she overcame all adversities and was victorious.  forbidden west alloy s is such a mary sue. she s called  the savior  every five minutes.  she s so cocky and she thinks and even says she s the only that can save the world. plus she doesnt need everyone s help to do it. it is she against the world. which it is just stupid. she feels like rey  skywalker  why is she that good  she doesnt have supernatural powers that gives her an edge.  she s just a regular woman that has a little more knowledge than most.  why is she better than all the rest of strong men.  Im not a sexist but if you want to make her the best there should be a reason. maybe she s a vampire ok  she has magical powers  ok she s an alien ok.  itshe s just a regular human woman. there s a part in the new game where she has cross into the forbidden west and there are a couple of guards and she s like dont make me move you. because she s stronger than two human male guards with weapons.  I still like the game and will finish playing it but when I see a character without flaws there seems to not be anything to learn from.
im so happy to see this channel thriving melonie!
so funny   I went shopping down the dairy aisle the first time in a couple of years monday and skipped over land-o-lakes butter for another because I didn t recognize it at first. the abandonment of the symbol was jarring and a little offensive. erasure !  respect.
Im also native  and I too love seeing the native inspired items  stories. also there are the metis  my native cousins that have white skin  and what if a child who isn t native is raised by natives
thing is when it comes to these  journalists  no matter what video game developers do they ll never be happy  they will always find something to complain about.you could make a game that is just  click the square on screen  and they d find some woke reason to be mad about it.
ive played the original zero dawn several times. the story was amazing and fun. zero dawn had all races represented. its literally part of the story. project zero dawn was created to revive humanity from the dna of all the races
in the dozen-or-so years I have been enjoying your content  Imust say that the woman that you grew up to be is by far the best version of you yet. based melonie is definitely the best melonie.
its bad enough they gave aloy a jawline like the rock after these same complainers complained she was too feminine.   oh  the article is from kotaku.  that explains it.edit   the best part about that joshua passage is starting in verse 6 God says continually be strong and courageous.  and  then in verse 9 he finally goes - didn t I tell you to be strong and courageous   Im with you!!!!  love it!
you said everything I wanted to say in my comment with the land o lakes thing  the redskins thing. being half-native myself its frustrating....
I think that the goal is becoming relatable or in some way achievable and to do this so we confident ourselves is to sacrifice the original content to accomplish that.
my great great grandmother was 100  cherokee and sold homemade blankets and loved that her work and culture was celebrated by other cultures.
I didn t know there was a sequel in the works.  will definitely be playing.  loved the first one.  aloy is a badass and the turok feel of hunting dinosaurs with the twist of them being robots is a fun twist.  was a lot of fun figuring out the right weapon for the job and where to aim on that five story high machine developed to kill you to take it down.  the story was actually really solid  so I disagree with the article here.  if anything  the game is a tribute to natives.  this is in the future and theirs is the culture strong enough to survive.  the core values of their tribes are the ones that made it through the generations.  haven t plugged in my ps4 in a while so hadn t heard about this  but now Im stoked.
I think that the reason for why they compromise one side of the scale of attraction vs confidence is due the fact that the character is not relatable or even overwhelming is the sense that you could not really feel comfortable if such a person were possibly real
what I like most about horizon zero dawn is how smoothly she moves around to controller input.  not clunky.  if you haven t played it lookup  amazing details of horizon zero dawn .
I bet you those game journalist wouldn t survive in that post apocalyptic world but yes if humanity was set back like that we will most definitely go back to our ancestors roots
shots fired
@melonie mac go boom  bang bang
you could make a game where you play as a non-binary wheelchair bound indigenous trans midget from mars who identifies as a cat and they would still find something to complain about. these people are the very definition of insane.
its discrimination against triangles and circles
hey melanie  new here. you canthank jeremy from  the quartering . do not get me started on land o lakes or the deadskins. they are now the capitol wokies. why are they wearing traditional native american garb in a post apocalyptic wasteland  asking for a friend.confidence is inversely proportional to breast size  do not tell that to my cnas.loved this episode.
can you talk about mandates and whats happening in canada  also would love to hear your thoughts on blackrock and vanguard creating woke social change with their esg policy s
first  they came for butter. now they come for videogames.
how can a game  not based in america  not based on native american anything  be appropriation of those things. this is so unbelievably wild to witness the mental gymnastics that people perform these days.
I was very impressed with the first horizon and will be playing forbidden west asap.loving the channel melonie  keep droppin them bombs darlin.  !boom!
my favorite Bible verse as well! I repeated in my head a million times getting through the toughest parts of my life.
you could easily say the outfits could also be inspired by the ainu  northern japan   early goths and gauls  germany   celtic  britain   ireland   or many of the native tribes still found in india or south america.
if these  gaming journalist  didn t complain about first world problems they wouldn t have jobs.
cultural appropriation has never been a thing. because nobody can claim to  own  a culture. culture is one of those things that really do belong to the entire world.a people or ethnic group can make the claim that they founded a culture  but they do not  own  it  nor do they have any right to tell other people whether they are allowed to engage with parts of that culture or not.I have just as much of a right to dress in a japanese kimono as any japanese person has for example  so long as I bought and paid for the kimono. although the japanese might be a bad example since when you talk to japanese people in japan  they tend to be happy to see foreigners wearing traditional japanese clothing. they like knowing that other people in the world appreciate parts of their cultural heritage.
you just spoken some harsh truths to people that only wants  inclusivity  so long as itsuits them.honestly I have been to afraid to even speak up all that much. not because I am afraid of the sjw mob  not the twitter puritans or anything like that. its usually because I am never heard unless  I pay money to  insert person or thing here   I ruffle some feather s and piss someone off  I dont people please  insert person here  ego  or whatever to where I wish to speak my mind  but another part of my mind cracks the whip and even if I wrote a well worded thought  I end up erasing it and write like in your case  youre so pretty   which I will not lie it is true  or say completely nothing and leave instead of truly speaking my mind.
my gf is native american and was so happy to see outfits in ff14 thatshe made an extra set for my character to wear as well. its the small things that matter the most
I thought it was neat that the article mentioned the magyar people. Im 100  hungarian on both sides of the tree so thats cool. I look like your average eastern european dude so Im sure the woke people would just lump me into the  white problem  without a second thought. anyway  my parents have a bunch of cool items like a traditional bullwhip and water canteen  paintings  ceramic figurines of people in the traditional clothing  18th-19th century stuff   etc. I gotta do one of those ancestry tests at some point so I can go down the rabbit hole on exactly what grouping I fall into... there s a ton of variation.but if some video game dev decided to design some stuff inspired by my culture I d be stoked. you just dont see it in pop culture.
hey mel  how about giving us a tour of all your lara croft figures sometime. I have a old 1ft one of lara in her dive suit from tomb raider 2  bought it at k-mart  remember those   back in the day.
freaking loved it. respect
you just made my day melonie!  joshua 1 9 is my favorite.   see comments from 2 9  the woke mob want to dictate every facet of your life   much love
I guess the writer didn t realize story wise we were extremely lucky to even survive as a species in a robot post apocalyptic scenario.
I cant wait for this to get nominated for the first annual wokie awards.
hI  mel! can I ask what documented native american means  meaning  you ve some additional information stated in your birth certificate  dont come for me just interested  since Im not from us  unfortunately. good vibes to you and your aunt.
great takes and insights as always but I always get so stoked for the verse of the day!!!! yes!!
the awesome new album   songs of cultural appropriation   featuring such great hits as dude looks like a lady   betty bought a bass boat    lola    Im turning japanese   ...
technically it is based in america.  but your right about everything else
@jeremy greene  yea colorado in zero dawn and california for forbidden west.
@cornelius antonius  here is the thing. all the native cultures of north  central and south america originated from asian migrations across what is now the bering strait  if Im not mistaken  14000 years ago or later . whose culture was appropriated now  do you understand  all this talking about cultural appropriation is utter bullshit.
I know right  I was joking to make thatsame point. @herandro just herandro european and asian develloped a bitseperate from eachother but we all come from africa
@cornelius antonius  I had already understood your irony.  furthermore  even completely isolated human cultures can end up developing very similar costumes and weapons  simply because they are human.be well.
if we dont embrace each others cultures and blend our cultures together into something we can all share and unity around then how canthey claim to want diversity if all they want is cultural segregation  what exactly are we supposed to unity around if we cant have anything we share in common with one another  if you like the japanese kimono because it is nice than the japanese culture over years have just enriched the whole world with something we can all appreciate and enjoy. only in america can someone be offended by  others  wearing or eating the product of your culture.
@seven proxies  well that is why they are so heavily invested in spreading their ideologies through public schools and universities. otherwise they cant grow.
keep speaking your mind  I love to see it
love that   they are so woke  that they woke themselves backwards  lol
hello from the iroquois nation  there is a difference between cultural appropriation and cultural appreciation. things in videogames that have native american vibes are awesome! tauren from the warcraft franchise for example. these people just want to be butthurt for the sake of being butthurt and dont really care at all about what they are saying.
lmao everytime I watch her channel keeps it
thank you for sharing joshua 1 9! excellent content  as always!
when your life is so easy that you declare that a video game has  sinned .
hard to find anti-woke gaming channels. youre one of the few too many woke gaming channels out there to sift through  that directly negatively affected the working class with their trash policies  that dont deserve my support.
the game editor they reference straight up says they dont try to explain it. they literally lost their whole past and culture. so she wants them to exposition dump on  our tribe wears this because....
I did notices this when I was going through my anthropology courses in collage  is that the people who brought into the cultural appropriation bs didn t do well in the classes. they couldn t wrap their mind round the idea that many cultures worlds apart did share or have similar garb  customs  or believes. for example the germantic nordic and celtic gallic peoples where very similar to native american for a time. I can also bring up the nanman tribes of southern china and southeast asia  who are the ancestors of modern southeast asians and the polynesians. Im getting side tracked  anthropology and history are kinda my favorite topics. anyways these woke knuckle draggers also could never understand the difference in showing appreciation for a culture  compared to insulting or disrespecting a culture. note  let s also point out these woke cultural appropriation types tend to insult or disrespect different cultures more then anyone else.
9 21  - aloy white  others color   do you know the story   aloy   white because she is a clone of  elisabet  a white female scientist from before the apocalypse. there are other  white  characters within the story  several of the characters in the first game  zero dawn  - the matriarch mother  erend  whom is in forbidden west   roth  the outcast whom raized her  zero dawn  and several in the dlc  frozen wilds .  why do I bring up the original game  because of their location... in the mountains and snow.  the forbidden west is mainly in plain desert  sun beaten  environment.  do people forget there is such a thing as melatonin    for the uninitiated  it is the thing that pigments  colors  skin.   those who live in desert regions or open plains often have darker  colored  skin due to the fact that melatonin reacts to the uv rays of the sun and darkens to protect the person. this shouldn t be a surprise to anyone with a  brain .   it is simply being consistent with the environment.as for wearing  native  clothing...  this is supposed to be 1000  years after the collapse of modern society.  there are no stores to go buy the latest hot topic clothes. all clothing is made from those things gathered around them.  note there are no  large  natural animals in the wild.  those are mostly machines.  only smaller creatures like boar  fox  raccoon.  not a lot of  leather  or large pieces to be creating clothing from. so things have to be stitched together.  no cotton or sheep to create wool or fabric with.  also the crops are dying because of the blight .  take a look at the story  where these people are and what has happened to them and how they would have  developed  over 1000  years given the limited resources and knowledge they had.  I think it is appropriate given that  beginning . 9 31  - female savior   I dont consider aloy a  savior .  yes she is called that by everyone else  but if you listen to the dialogue  aloy doesnt want to be called that  she doesnt want to be the savior.  she actually realized she if  forced  to do these things because she is a  clone  and is the only one whom has the genetic makeup that can accomplish some of the things that need to be done  interact with gaia and the other computers around the world .  she is the  reluctant hero   protagonist .
woke person   all we want is a little representation. guerrilla games   okay  here is a strong  independent female protagonist from a diverse tribe inspired by various cultures and ethnicities. woke person   not good enough.
in response to heroic women figures I personally do enjoy it. mainly because I have had the unfortunate experience of dealing selfish women seeking an adrenaline rush and I have felt victimized to it.
Im from oklahoma.  100  european  but half my extended family are choctaw  one of my best friends growing up is kiowa.  been to sweats with sioux  cheyenne  and cherokee.  if the world were gone today  I would wear skins  and wouldn t feel like I were insulting any of them.  I d feel like I was trying to cover my junk . and stay warm ..  maybe I could find a bedazzler to help whiten those skins up . anything but turquoise right
its times like this where Im grateful to be a fan of roguelikes where eye bleed inducing graphics or asciI art are the norm. super nerds cant be bothered with trivial things like appropriation while in deep contemplation of a dwarf fortress map.
you forgot the cleveland  guardians ...the cleveland indians were named after louis sockalexis a penobscot from maine  my home state and my home town is home to the penobscot reservation  who played for the then cleveland spiders.
truly  game journos are still one of the banes of modern times... great video  melonie! btw what would you say to someone who s having a crisis of faith because God doesnt answer his prayers
good take as always its people trying to find things to be offended about which is great    people need to get over them self
like many others  I am native.  Im also really tired of these liberals telling me what I should be offended by.  the only thing that offends me is watching lots of natives waste away in reservations rather than assimilating into society.
Im stealing that quote - so woke they woked themselves backwards . lol love it .
the original face for the 2013 xbox 360 version of lara croft was perfection imo. she was stunning... and then they went and changed her face for the xbox one  definitive  version of the game for absolutely zero reason. they can never just leave well enough alone.
quoting ecclesiastes in a reaction vid of a game article  truly a woman after my own heart.
people really need to step away from the aaa sphere where this woke nonsense is most apparent. dont buy into the hype cycle of such titles etc the best games over the last 5 or so years  at least  have been indies. aaa gaming is creatively bankrupt  it became stagnant around the late 00 s. the injection of woke nonsense post-gamergate has just turned the situation from bad to worse.
couple things. God knows best  and when I think of some of my past prayers I asked him I am so glad they didn t happen. so he knew better than me. secondly  we are not guaranteed a perfect life because sin is in the world  so sadly bad things will happen to all of us. but one thing I have thousand percent noticed is that when I distance myself from God or blame him  my life doesnt get any better. when I finally stopped being stubborn and put God first - made that my top priority  all of a sudden things started falling into place. I know my life will never be perfect and there are still some of my biggest prayers that have yet to be answered  but Im putting all my faith and trust in God that everything will happen when the time is right.reading from genesis again helped a ton. seeing abraham  isaac  jacob  and joseph s faith and where it got them. was so inspiring. I realized I need to have thatsame faith myself  so in good times in bad  I have to focus on trusting God always.
imo  cultural appropriation  is only a term given by supremacists who dont want to see members of their own  supreme  race looking like others they think are below them. the rest of us realise we are human and things are awesome. there s days I want to just wear grey  and there s days I would love to be able to pull off a multicolour headdress! you hit the nail on the head when you said  they woke so hard that they become racists themselves  and thats the whole woke shuffle right now...  s
also you nailed the nail on the head   these are not natives getting mad at this and I dont know any native that gets mad at this type of stuff . I know many that were mad over the sport team changes   I live near a rez and they always wore   those so called racist teams clothing .
take a tequila shot everytime melonie mac says the word woke
melonie  you are proof that a woman can be both confident and attractive.  you would make a fine lara!
so here s the thing. this is the audience these developers wanted. these psychos are the people they tried to cater to by uglifying alloy in the first place.
talking about beautiful confident women we cant forget sonya blade.
what s crazy about the internet is that the same people who get offended  will stream the most offensive stuff imaginable once they turn on netflix.
new sub! here from the quartering. keep up the great work youre really funny!
I was born here.  Im a native american.  my parents were both born here.  they were native american.  their parents were born here.  they were native american.Im native american.
10 50  italian accent   itsmacks of cannolI  love ya melonie
I would love to hear your take on this pastor who says  witches are among his church and he plans to expose them. you may have something interesting to say about all of it.
great game review! they sold me on the game. I am definitely going to get this game just to piss them the game urinals .
oh my heavens  when will people learn to judge everything with only their feelings.....
you know if they had played the previous game  it would make sense that they speak english giving that the game takes place in a us apocalyptic areas where robots that acted as care takers spoke english. hence the 1st humans reborn heard english 1st and thus learned it...but hey details right
entertaining content. cheers!
mel  you dont toe the corporate line  they ll come for you no matter how many of their interesectional boxes you check.
that verse is beautiful. it reminds me  no matter what happens  we get a happily ever after with our father in heaven forever. another verse that gives me hope  is jeremiah 29 11
melonie mac is a Goddess and seems cool
they made the main character fatter  blotchier faced  etc to be more  realistic . and still its not enough. when will these people learn you play stupid games you win stupid prizes
if horizon were realistic  civilization would have fallen because the robots became woke.
@cornelius antonius  we did it first and for longer lol you were too trendy and started using fabrics  so you lost the right lol.
@Lorddarkhelmet  I dont think you can really say who did it first but you are right about the fancy fabrics.
can never please the woke no matter what you do - they will always find something to try to get some sense of moral high ground on
I am tired of the  savior hero mary sue  trend as well  which I can only describe as narcissistic but also delusional  self-inserts  of the woke cultists  that have no actual resemblance to their beliefs and especially actions in the real world. not to mention  its boring  as you said. there is a thing  where when it comes to games  a big portion of people  especially those that like role-playing  wanna experience something different than real life  either playing as the opposite gender  being a villain bad so on. you know... something that you are not irl  although I do fail to do that in well written games like mass effect . having this in mind   based on my observations during the last several years  where the  woke lunatics  were ravaging everything  not just entertainment   we can safely  conclude that they are basically  the bad guys   and it makes sense when it comes to the numerous times when their past  or current  skeletons get exposed. these are severely malicious  and at the same time stupid and ignorant people  things that can clearly be seen as manifestations in the work they create  or corrupt   for example the way they write stories characters  or portray good vs. evil   and especially the way they write villians  remember what a joke disney s star wars is  . all of the  woke villians  are contrived  ridiculous  nonsensical  unrealistic  thats because they are often deluded projections of how the woke cultists perceive their political cultural opponents  which ofc are a threat to their agenda  which is nothing but power and despotism .  what ever they  create  suffers from this  which is why their work often feels as unrealistic contrived ridiculous. in a way  we can say that the woke cultists basically  role-play  being  good guys  irl  what for normal people is common sense   while actually doing harm and destroying society s fabric  mainly in the western world ofc  where they are  allowed  to operate.a few words can be said about the  cultural appropriation  bs as well  but its getting too long already. in short  hypocrisy and stupidity aside  they actually are enemies of diversity when it comes to culture  which can be concluded based on their severe disdain against groups people that think differently than they do  or simply by looking at the results of their  actions . they are hiding within the cult for protection diversion. whether they realize it is not important at this point. different cultures races with various values  traditions and beliefs are actually the biggest enemy of group zombie think  which is what the cult needs for their own security   and the irony is huge when it comes to this  especially when we see how the consequences results of their actions completely contradict their  noble  intentions. and we know how they treat the people they  pretend  to  fight for   when they  step out of line   or dare to think outside of the woke frame  which of course means - its all a facade  a lie. these people are psychopaths. malicious and evil  and they are doing it for their personal selfish reasons. f ck em.
this is literally cultures that live thousands of years after an apocalypse and probably saw remains of the ancient cultures and so built their own a good example of this is in fallout new vegas   the ceasar legion   ceasar literally found books about ancient rome and decided to build his whole own civilisation around what he tought rome was
this is getting ridiculous now. no one had a problem with it in the first one. why are they getting mad at this one all of a sudden
these people need to find a cause to believe when it comes to their whole agenda. there has to some way to keep their movements going when new content is put out there. if they dont then their whole campaign will not be able to continue.
on the gaming journos  it comes down to whose paying them to bury who.
so they made aloy look like justin silverman in a wig to appease the twitterazI  and they re still not appeased  I am shocked! its like any concessions made aren t good enough for that crowd.
culture appropriation  is from the same people that will say  stereotypes are racist  but here they are to say thatspecific cultures belong to specific races ethnicities.
wus up chicky!!!! keep  em coming because we are watching!!!! 18.7k subscribers awesome!!!!
think about it  post application  the cloths will be stone age regardless  no textile industry. I like the game that lit you  build  your character  i.e. color  sex  clothes etc. .
1800 s -  these people are inhuman savages 2022 -  these people were wood elf like creatures who didn t understand what violence and war was  I guess natives are just doomed to never be seen for what they are  just normal human beings. revolutionary I know!
you d think game journalists would spend their time better. like  I dunno  playing games  just an idea.
Im going to get this game now
it takes place in california so they picked up on native american iconography and customs that was left after the fall.
to my knowledge  horizon s cultures are an amalgamation of nordic  celt  native american  japanese and africantribal looks. it doesnt portray any specific culture or pretends to be representing any nations - regions.
they better not mess with my horizon.
what do you think about playstation censoring martha is dead and other foreign games  yet not censoring their games like tlous2
all they have to do is show one employee that has any native blood  pretty much guaranteed to be at least one  even in a small company .  then the tech journos will be blatantly exposed as the racists they already are.
what did you think of - lara croft  and the temple of osiris - and - lara croft  and the guardian of light - Im new to your channel  I was sent by thequartering a few days back so I dont know your whole past so I d love to know what you think.
I wasn t going to play horizon forbidden west to begin with  not because of  cultural appropriation   but because I got caught in the hype storm around the 1st horizon game and was greeted by an ok game when I played it. I thought I was about to play the next mass effect or final fantasy viI and instead it was the next dynasty warriors or ecco the dolphin. good games in their own right  but cant compare to legends. the contrast of what I expected and what I experienced was vast and I haven t gotten over it yet.
I hate that these loonies keep putting people in boxes. all in the name of inclusion. seems like they want everyone separated. we are all humans.
who tf is justin silverman
Im so heckin happy     thank youuu!
will feature this comment in a video and answer  d
as the great tom macdonald said  activism saved the planet  no more plastic straws wrapped in paper  just paper straws wrapped in plastic  congratulations...
saw an old comment from you on an aba and preach video I was watching  I see you were always a real one
as I like to say  there are a lot of crazy ppl at large out there
I still haven t played the game yet. looks dope though.
every culture has appropriate other cultures.
would be cool to see a gta game based on cartel warfare like in mexico. that ll be a good idea to appropriate. rockstar is missing out.
can we talk about about how aloy went from actually looking like a woman in the first game to now looking like buzz from home alone in the second  if these people are going to complain about anything  thatshould be it. the first hzd was awesome. I personally loved that they took a lot of influence from native american culture  but placed it in a futuristic setting. thought that was really cool  and one of the things that made the first game great. im excited to finally get my copy of forbidden west in today and play it. I hope its just as good as the first game. these people need to stop.
fur  feathers  bone.....all pretty common in every hunter gather or tribal society.....
Im not surprised the journos are calling  cultural appropriation  but I am a little surprised they didn t do that with the first game. to be fair  maybe I just didn t hear about it with horizon zero dawn  but I really dont remember many  if any  complaint s about cultural appropriation when it was released cause it had the same  issues  as the sequel.
found you from quarterings video. I watched his vid on you and then you showed up in my recommended. great vids.
inspiration! has anyone heard of that there is no appropriation since all is mixed-up  game wise . sure there will be differences from place to place. ofc there are native  of any given place  clothing  culture  food etc  one can wear something without being disrespectful  not making mockery of any given thing . some like to gate keep and feel offended for others when they are not being malicious nor disrespectful.
Im irish and russian. now thats one hell of a mix. just when you think that woke people cant get any more ridiculous they do. you cant help but wonder how far they will go and how it will end. what I find funny is when they turn on each other.
melonie mac love your contact here. ever since herd of you from quartering I have whaching your videos since . the only video game character female I think can compare to original lara croft is helena walker from ark survival evolved what do you think
I looked at your other socials. I d get into alt tech. you may grow faster on rumble than youtube for example.
what do melonie mac do  she go boom
oh my God  youre a hot half-native  half irish woman  God does exist x.xnow all she needs is a headdress.
Im native  bought hzd on steam when it released. and I have to say  I enjoyed the game and loved the gameplay  characters and art style. kotaku is a joke of a game news site  and these  game uorno s  wonder why we make fun of and laugh at em.
I had an easier time finding waldo than I had spotting the native american in this video.
tbh I dont know if people are forgetting that this game takes place in the future after everything was wiped out. leaving the rest of humanity to go back to their old roots  chances are they re all natives.
the people who say  cultural appropriation  are the same people who use anime characters in their profile. Im sure they are not japanese
cultural appropriation is purely an americanthing. go to various places in asia and they are more than happy to share and engage their cultural with people.
funny how they try to speak for native people when all you would have to do is ask if they find it offensive...Im sure most would not care  having more important things to worry about then a video game which is just a guess I have no idea.
this game s gonna get my wompum.
hmmmm in horizon zero dawn ya find out that the human race was literally wiped out to the last person  the ferros robots literally caused an extinction event. project zero dawn was created to reboot the human race which technically means that all the humans regardless of race in horizon zero dawn are native americans. although what concerns me the most is how come aloy now looks like she has mumps... her face has ballooned insanely.
kutaku didn t get any add rev off the game so they are breaking a few things to remind them
as long as they dont come for the most awesome logo in sports  my chicago blackhawks!
I love how these journalists point out a specific tribe of people and speak in place of native americans instead of getting their  or any other tribes in the world s  opinions on the matter. ngl  that in and of itself sounds pretty racist
inspiration  cant be a thing anymore
this reminds me of the football team in canada  the eskimos  who changed their name because some  woke  leftist said it was racist.  I asked my first nations  native friends  none of them were offended by the team s name.  I always loved the eskimo name as I imagined some indians in snow gear destroying in football.
I have several native friends who live on tribal lands in san diego. they were actually pissed when they changed the redskins name.  they used to wear redskin jerseys and jackets to school all the time  and now they want nothing do do with the nfl.  these people shouting and complaining about this type of couture appropriation in games are not natives  but the white rich kids who had gone to college and were told by other racists how to think.
they say all the garments are native appropriation  but apart from the headdresses  the armour and clothing designs were seen all over the world in the stone and  some areas  the bronze ages. as well as during viking scandinavia. animal furs were not explicit to native americantribes
I bought the 2013 tomb raider on sale on gog. played it for 5 minutes and uninstalled it. I ll give it another go at some point  but I think I d just rather play the ps1 originals.
appropriating native american culture... mcdonald s  shoney s  sears   roebuck  ford...
yeah  imagine a group of diverse people due to humanity and civilization collapsing end up in the same exact locale and similar circumstances to the ones early native americantribes were in  and they end up dressing and acting in a similar manner  shocking!!!its like groups of humans will act like other groups humans when put in very similar location and circumstances  outrageous!!!
thats just getting too weird. Imean if they do the same thing and create black elves and dwarfs in Lord of the rings amazon show  they should have no problem with that right
these journalists seem to forget that cultures exist outside america and its obvious to see that the whole game is a mix of celtic nordic asian and yes native american influences
super smash bros. ultimate  is my favorite competitive game.  nintendo remove a feather from mr. game   watch because someone somewhere might interpret that feather as offensive to native americans.  how canthey be certain that mr. game   watch isn t native american !
itsagundam is gonna have a field day with this.
as a blackfoot-irishman  I love your style. eff these woke-sI chu.
how about the simple idea that pretty much all previous knowledge of humanity has been lost and they are starting over from scratch.
I always saw it as honouring those cultures. the idea that  hundreds of years in future  history and culture forgotten  society reforms and adopts native american mannerisms. thatseems to imply that that is a more normal and natural way of life.
amazing how lots of the stuff they are wearing looks a lot like ancient briton   gaul  hun  macedonia or various other ancient communities. the game is dealing with people sent back to the  ston-ish age  and its in n.america so really it wouls be parrellel aquisition not appropriation. humans exposed to the same stimulI tend to do the same thing.
nowadays  having some paint on your face and using a bow in a fantasy - scI fI video game is a fucking crime ... wth
I cant stand game journalists. I normally go with the opposite of what they say. if they like a game  I will more than likely hate it  tlou2 . all they do is try to find something to complain about  unless the game fits their narrative. most of the time they dont even play much of the games they are reviewing.
cultural appropriation is cultural appreciation
appropriation     uncountable  singular   formal or law  the act of taking something that belongs to somebody else  especially without permission.how can a culture be taken  who does a culture belong to  who can give permission
I dont claim to know what the devs had in mind when they designed the cultural elements of the peoples portrayed in the game  but if we just start from the basic premise--i.e.  civilization collapsed  and technology was pretty much forgotten--the only materials available for crafting clothes and tools basically dictate what people would be able to make. when you absolutely cant make polyester  nylon or any form of polymers  then your stuck with covering bodies in buckskins and coarse  tarp-like cloth. as for bows  the mongols in the 12th century mastered horseback archery and conquered most of asia. and the lascaux caves paintings  which were created 17 000 years ago in frikkin  france  also show someone using a bow and arrow.  world history  people! besides  anyone with a lick of sense should get that  when you need to take down cyborg beasts  you ll do it from a distance if you can manage it.in short  I dont think the game s peoples necessarily copied native american cultural elements  so much as they rediscovered our shared  pre history. if the devs looked at native american imagery and styles for inspiration  I think thats great! but as I explained  it would be an oversimplification to say that the game is simply copying something that is exclusively native american.
Im blackfoot indian   scottish and Im not offended.
as an individual who has some native american blood running through my veins  I have german and possibly irish or scottish blood too  I dont see the issue here. the character designs are a work of art which offers variety compared to other games. as for the social aspect you have to look at the games story and setting. if using certain cultures in different ways or if its you follow the stereotype  and its considered offensive then just shut the entertainment industry down because Im sure you could find things that are offensive just because you want to look for things to be offensive about. and if you want to look for stuff to be offended then you offend me. so what should I do then  and what should the person who offends me do  I doubt they would change in any way.
the people complaining about this  we re the same people calling you a bigot last week for complaining about black elves and dwarves in the new Lord of the rings show....
far cry primal  appropriating prehistoric culture.they could have made aloy so much cuter and feminine  and a developing love story with a man just as strong as her. Im asking for too much in current year 2022.idk about the 2nd game though  just thatshe has a more manly jaw  so it doesnt bode well. fyI  the outfit people choose the most to wear in the first game was the most revealing one.
is anyone surprised  do game jurn-jurns enjoy anything I dont think they could say anything nice about a saucy chicken nugget at this point  even if its dark meat .
so what is aloy supposed to wear  a flannel shirt and jeans  a track suit  fitness wear
stone age europeans wore furs  skins  and headdresses that were very similar to what native americans wore. the game takes place after the fall of civilization and everyone goes back to the stone ages. these people think stone age europeans wore khakis and polo shirts.
as a native american  I call horseshit.appropriation isn t a concern in a fictional setting when said culture no longer exists in that particular fictional setting.
its like they didn t even play the game.  humanity is completely wiped out.  all of the people who make up the new tribes in the game all came from the underground vaults.  any sense of culture was erased.  and the computer systems that humanity invented to  hopefully  teach the new generations of people about the past...were rendered inoperable.  so whatever  culture  the different tribes have in this game isn t based on anything before it.  not in the universe of the game at least.
I haven t played the game yet  but I think its a good game if people are only complaining  about  cultural appropriation  of the game and not the actual game play.
I enjoy the game in the characters in the diversity there is a choice system in the game you can choose a selfish path a hostile path and a loving caring path but the main character she is selfish in the fact thatshe want to save the world for selfish reasons so that one day she can be just left alone exploring the past but she doesnt do it alone she has help from friends she is a flawed character in many ways she struggles with her past and where she comes from I have played the game do you learn this in horizon zero dawn I see a lot of the main character in you
so tribes or clans exist  see the entire prehistory of northern europe. the preitanI  the painted people   the celts  my people  the welsh  cornish   southern ireland  the angles  the scottI  the cambrians  barbarians  bearded people  etc etc. the characters wear animal skins and head-dresses  literally any of the aforementioned tribes   clans would have donned these artefacts  except maybe the celts who preferred to be naked
melonie - could be me  but itsounds like your mic a bit hot  grainy breakup at peak
wokespeak in action. they hate unity of different cultures. they despise embracing beautiful differences of cultures  and being human with each other. to appropriate is to appreciate.
Im actually getting into the video now  my initial comment was based on my initial thoughts by the premise of the video - knowing how these things usually go  and I find the things being brought up in the article to be pretty ridiculous  d you know  something thats never  ever going to make sense with me is how proponents of  cultural appropriation  refuse to see the positives in the normal way in which it typically happens and it was 100  imitative and mimicry and 100  flattering. no one engages with a  native  aesthetic  whatever the hell that means anyway  with the desire to be deriding  derisive and derogatory - they re appealing to something  they like . but thats another thing entirely - that article is touching upon imagined appropriation in a fictional world that only exists digitally  d dismissing entirely the notion that humans forced into primitive  stone-age lifestyles and cultures might revert back to something else  something entirely plausible and historically understandable.again  in a fictional  digital world. there s also the utterly meta-textual notion to all of this - outside of the idiot meta considerations these modern day  low-wattage  leftist knobs are making  there is no argument because in the fictional world in which this takes place  its not as though these guys had books or magazines or movies  videos  etc  kicking around in which they could see past  native  cultures and thus appropriate them and their aesthetics for themselves  d they ve been forced into pre-modern ways and they ve found some familiar roots.also there s robots roaming the lands  so  maybe the weirdo leftists should do that thing they like to say a lot... the touching-grass thing  you know there may come a time when the only way certain past cultures will ever see representation and rebirth will be at the hands of people that have no blood or locational-birth ties of their own  but whom come across the culture from the outside and find something they love and want to emulate or keep alive. something to consider  you know also  I really love your thoughts about the land of lakes native  d that was my first thought as well when it happened  I used to work in grocery retail  so I saw it happen in real time  and for me it was a holy shit  really laugh-out-loud moment because unironically  the white  weirdo-leftist  knee-jerk closet-racists removed the native woman from her land so they could feel better about it and morally superior  d they sent her on her very own trail of tears or long walk to defend the honor of indigenous natives everywhere... but they kept her land. took her off of it  but kept her land anyway. historically accurate if utterly inappropriate.
even woke games are getting hit pieces.
every culture began as primitive hunter gatherers. every. single. one.so how can it be cultural appropriation when it represents the origin off all cultures
we have a game set in a post - post - post apocalyptic american landscape in the distant future. why are people talk english
all I can say is  good.  nothing makes me happier than to know the woke mob is pissed off about this game.  gives me hope that they stayed true to the story so far.
ever seen ryan long s skit about racists and wokesters being the same thing  freaking hilarious.
you can never be woke enough for the wokies.
to me the game feels like a blending of vikings and native americans tribes.
is it native american  I thought it was the flinstones season 3.
today s game journalists are nothing like the journo s of the very long past that actually played the games for what they are fictional stories and art for us to enjoy and escape reality . I look at no reviews that has anything to do with these people as they act like everything that is created is real life associated somehow. this has me baffled beyond belief. I am not american indian at all so I cant actually comment on this apparent cultural appropriation thing towards you   but I am a part indigenous australian and I would have no problem fighting back against these woke fools if any type of game was centralized around australia and they came out with this type of bs. they are a disgrace these so called journo s and what needs to happen is not to give them the clicks. all they are are doing is causing division to get everyone hating each other. thats what I believe they are going for and doing. they dont care for nothing else imo. gosh I hope this makes sense.  btw melonie keep up the great work you are a inspiration to alot of people out here .
oh my grief  its like the journos covering hfw never played game one  if they had they would know why humanity is essentially starting from square 1  again. the apollo sub-unit is  uh the cause for that.if I was a betting man  I d wager they tossed together a half assed 2hr play through  and called it a review.
im so fkin tired of wokeness.anyway  just under 3 hours until im playing horizon.
this woke stuff is getting out of hand last couple of years. these games are fantasy world most the time and just someone s creative vision.  everyone gets to upset over these tiny details. I say if you dont like it dont buy or watch it. its a great game
here they come walking down the streetget the funniest looks from everyone they meetheyheyits the wokies
didn t lara in the reboot trilogy slowly become selfish and psychotic in rise   shadow of the tomb raider  also  I found lara to be very beautiful in the reboot trilogy  its kinda weird to see you think otherwise when there are so so many other western games out there with some straight up ugly women in them.
someone explain to me in what period of time did native americans battle giant robot dinosaurs. I clearly missed that point in history. gaming  journos would be appropriating the job of actual journalists if journalism still existed.
damned if ya do damned if ya dont.......thats wokenes for ya.
its one reason I still stick to sites like electronic gaming monthly.  these new basement writers on websites like gamerant are not experienced journalists.  just listening to youreading their material shows it.  .... and more importantly sounds like modern day white people....  should not have been published by this editor.
so society is collapsed  which means factories are gone so what do you expect them to make clothes out of
I ll be playing too! stoked!
not really  she cries all the time and has inner monologs saying she doesnt want to let people down  and she is constantly trying to be a savior.
@melonie mac go boom  but her selfish psycho obsession with trinity almost got her friend killed not once  not twice but three times and yet she continued on. also her selfish quest to be thatsavior destroyed a city and killed who knows how many innocent people  she really screwed shit up in her selfish quest for answers. I do enjoy the newer reboot games more but I would like the sexy lara back even tho I do like the current version but I feel like you cannot make current lara sexy  its impossible  which I find hilarious. I think the issue is they are trying to make a fictional character more real  which is... hmm.. not a good idea sometimes and itseems that people think making a female real is making her emotional I guess which is also funny to me  and I find it funny thatshe s crying while committing mass murder  that was truly comedic. I like the games tho and I while I dont think it will happen  I do hope you get classic lara back in a future full featured title.
its kind of fun that this comes from the same cultural background thats generating more and more cases of cultural appropriation when it comes to iconic white characters turned black.
this is actually so ridiculously infuriating. the entire story of the game involves cultural genocide  and not even just that  but nine segregated rebirthing of the human race. you literally cant make a single argument for cultural appropriation about horizon. it makes complete logical sense in the game world to have mixed races representing tribal cultures.
melonie knocking that microphone around!! like some kinda drunk irish indian!!  d
the idea of  cultural appropriation  is the worst thing to happen to racial equality in recent decades.people used to be inspired to learn about and engage with other societies  slowly breaking down the barriers that divided us. now everyone must stick in their assigned boxes for fear of offending internet blobs.
Im here for the cute and hot takes.
my big gripe with horizon zero dawn is that most of the white male characters were evil  or blithering idiots. otherwise great game  built on a great sci-fI story.
I thought the tribes were more aztec in aesthetic. did they even play the game  the tribes are not suppoesed to represent anything from real life. all of humanity became extinct and basically had to start from scratch with no recollection of the cultures that existed in the past.
people have no idea what  fiction  means  huh
Im just going to play the game even harder then. ashly burch is super woke and is aloy but thats not enough. its pretty cool to honor the native americans like the game does but its never ever enough.
the same people would be mad if aloy wore a crop top and shorts lmao..im shocked the dude didnt say she was black culture appropriating too cause she had dreads lol
they also forget that barbarian tribes in europe dressed and lived like that to  as well as gaelic tribes. not to mention its a post apocalyptic world they cant run down to the local gap to go shopping.
many different tribal people of different races have worn animal skins over the years. they are animal skins  they are worn to keep people warm and to take on harsh environments. but natives do need more representation in media  100
most of the time cultural appropriation  can be a form of flattery   its all about context. these people just ignore context and use there emotions and not logic .................uhhhggg
lemme see if I have this right - me on lotr  black dwarves dont make any sense!  leftist response  thats racist!!! its fantasy  it can be whatever we imagine . me on zero dawn  I think leathers reminiscent native gear looks cool.  leftist response  thats whites appropriating native culture  you racist!!!  but  but I thought it didn t matter with fantasy.
so unless everything is super bland and generic its problematic.... sure sure sure. let them make their own bland non problematic games that have nothing recognizable from any culture and all the characters and genderless amorphous blobs of nondescript origin. if they can do that... lets see how well they sell. and when they dont sell   they cant blame it on people being racist or an istaphobe.
these woke journalists seem to be confusing the terms  cultural appropriation  and  cultural appreciation.  if the costume design was inspired and not a direct copy of native american garb  then thats cultural appreciation. also  I find it very ignorant that when these journalists write about native americans  they write and speak as if  native american  is a singular culture with the same clothing and traditions. which is factually incorrect and highly offensive.
I haven t played the game but seen pics is it really native american specifically  there where other hunter gatherer societies that dressed similarly.  the game depicts that period of time so you would dress them accordingly  you wouldn t see the characters wearing modern day clothing also modern day native americans dont dress like that now so isn t that kind of racist for them to automatically think that of them
if I was native american my name would be cantfindhispenis
I actually liked the premise of the horizon series and the gameplay was pretty good. the story though is pretty meh.
for you have to create the bogeyman first before you can be scared of the bogeyman.
isnt the main bad guy sylens
@purefoldnz  yeah but the issue is the overall theme that develops when the characters with certain traits behave like whimpering children or monsters throughout the game. it makes a bigger impression than the behavior of one character.
@purefoldnz  he isn t really a bad guy. just he has his own agenda and thinks he s smarter than anyone else. he seems villainous because he s a  the end justify the means  kinda guy. but said end he s hoping to achieve is technically for the greater good.
so humanity was totally wiped out but with the effort of the leading scientist they took a large variety of gene s from all races and creeds to restart the human race. as time passed you see that the plans they set out was flawed in more ways then one. you have the new humans released into a world that would be alien to what we would know and then they form tribe and clans as we would as well if thrown into this type of setting. its sad when you look at it from the perspective of Im playing a character in a world I dont live in but I have to view there world with my world views or my political views. wtf this is a fantasy world people you play games for a escape so escape and have f ing fun for once. your killing enjoying the releases and the personal touch of verses with the vids
the only weak thing I saw in horizon  zero dawn was the ubisoft syndrome the open world suffered. not to mention all the hand holding a lot of new major sony titles like to do.... and dont get me started on the chatter.... too much talking! but I digress. these journalists hurt my iq. but speaking of sony. this stuff was what I feared with this game. it didn t help where they pulled thatstupid stuff off with the  70.
cultural appropriation is cultural appreciation.
might have to play this game now. has been on my list for a long time but other games keep getting slotted in front of it. pretty lame that indians are being removed from everything. cultures that aren t maintained or allowed to be idolized will be forgotten over time. there are actual terrible problems to worry about on the rez before being annoyed by some ginger in a headdress which is actually dope and should be seen as veneration. you wanna help indians  then abolish the bia and let natives have fewer obstacles to success. end the bureaucracy and corruption.
I dunno I dunno melonie lets ask chief thunder from killer instinct if he approves
I remember seeing a tweet from someone on twitter complaining that in cyberpunk the author made black gangs bad and violent and they were racist. the author  mike pondsmith   replied with a photo and he had long dreadlocks and black skin. soon shut the twitter crowd up. I know why they wear clothing of native americans. humanity has gone back to hunter gathers which means they have to wear animal skins and decorate themselves with items and animal parts rather than crafted jewellery. people in britain used to dress in animal furs and wear feather tokens at some point in our past. the woke left are pushing too much and are becoming racist themselves.
I just saw the thumbnail  and my insides just did an eyeroll.yes  this is one of my favorite games thats been out recently  at this point it is my favorite of any Ive played but bias aside.cultural appropriation is the stupidest thing Ive ever seen and it just goes to show how they didn t even play or know anything about the first game  which explains why civilization is nomadic and tribal .plus  what part of this is derogatory or putting native americans into a stereotypical light   its just all so dumb.I ll stop the rant and press play now  I paused it at 0 06 because I had to say something now because of how stupid it is.
Imean the world she lives in isn t even real.
I think I should point out we all knew they were tribal peoples and gaia brought all ethnicities back to life..  nobody complains about the asian oseram
they did this same story for the first game and everyone laughed at them.. now they re copy n pasting the story again for the sequel.. and the laughs shall be louder at them.
I the luck of the irish     the more the people given into woke the more the woke want . let s have a good game with duke nukem and lara croft as the main characters going around chasing the woke and raiding their tiny little brains.
could have sworn this nation was founded to be a melting pot  give us your sick  your poor etc...  where everyone can come and share their cultures and ideas  free of oppression from kings and the like  right  its disappointing that our the world  biggest strength of having multiple ideas and cultures to learn and take the best of  is now portrayed as cultural appropriation. the world would never exist how it is today if tech  culture or progression weren t shared and the best ideas kept to teach the next generation. the movie idiocracy is becoming as relevant as movies like v for vendetta these days.
code talkers are my favorite
my two cents here.  people who accuse others of appropriating native american culture should not wear western-style clothing  nor should they use electricity or drive automobiles  they should not live in modern houses or use computers or the postal system  they should cook their food over a fire or boil it using hot rocks  they should not use telephones or fly on airplanes  they should not avail themselves of modern healthcare  doctors or hospitals  they should not use firearms and they should not use cell phones or the internet.
I know we re all rebels but since we go boom around here  does that make us all............boomers  heh heh heh
aloy is a great character  and the urinalist is wrong -  its not  native american  culture. there are different tribal cultures developed in ways that mimic actual tribal evolution throughout history across the entire planet.just sad I cant play until the pc version comes out.
am I getting this right  they are complaining of actual cultural appropriation  because of the fact thatsome characters in a game !   a fictional storytelling have a somewhat vague similarity to native americans  and thats it  you could also call it inspiration or creative freedom...when did it become famous to throw buzzwords at each other  just so one can bathe in unhinged lack of tolerance...  just on a side note  cyberpunk 2077... how many cultural stereotypes does that game serve as characters  honestly  I could probably look at half the games   movies on the market today and find some reference to cultural habits or appearance of whatever  minority .surprisingly no one screams  cultural appropriation  there  guess why...
commenting to feed the algorithm
I dont recall being asked if I found this shit to be offensive or culturally appropriated. nor was I asked if I need some white knight to stand up for me. in fact  the idea that we re so fragile that we d need this is insulting in itself.
91  of native americans didnt mind the redskins logo and this seems to be the same with most of the so called   cultural appropriations
@sebangler  thats fair.  its interesting that they did a more soft rpg style.  I never played any witcher games and I didn t realize they had that level of pedigree on their staff.maybe in forbidden west it ll have more rpg elements.  I could see them wanting to focus more on story and their new assets on the world so they didn t pull what wound up happening with the division and cyberpunk
my two cents from the lara croft comment near the end of this video. trust me  building muscle is insanely difficult  it takes significant amounts of time  effort  patience  and critical thinking. and thats for a dude having the advantage of testosterone! with the extra effort it takes for a woman to develop an athletic physique  they dont accept no for an answer to anything!that level of relentlessness should be celebrated and easily jelly over. so yeah  it makes total sense these game developers dont lift and feel inadequate.
i... dont get this article  it was explained pretty well why aloy and the rest of humanity speak and look the way that they do. aloy and the rest of humanity are not descendants of those that came before  they are in fact the first set of humans to walk the earth in over a thousand years because the first generation of kids was born  bred  and raised safely within arks cauldrons  with the idea that they would be given the knowledge to rebuild the world after gaia and hades put it back together. of course  that didn t happen  so they were only capable of learning so much  and one of those things was probably english... and that was about it. gaia was for some reason ordered to not help or  interfere  with the development of humanity once released into the world. sure  this wasn t entirely spelled out for the player  and some inference needed to be made on the player s end  but the information is all there. they are genetically our descendants  that was the point  that they would be human but not clones or replicas of those that came before. as for the dreads and general style of clothing  what do you want  they live in huts and villages  not cities within a warm client like meridian. they are a nomadic tribe that lives in temperate weathers like mother dwelling  they need to stay warm too  and animal hides and skins when crafted make for warm clothing. I understand generally about cultural appropriation  but for horizon  we got to look at the setting  the story  the characters  and why they look and sound the way they do  and devs checked all those boxes and more when creating the nora tribe. lastly  these are people who never learned about the truth outside of aloy  and even then she doesnt know what came before.
cultural appropriation is an illogical concept invented to segregate people. humanity has exchanged cultural practices  foods  customs  philosophies  etc.  since prehistory  either by force  which most cultures have participated in pretty evenly   or by voluntary trade. its how we naturally  actually progress and learn.cultural appropriation is as silly as  white privilege fragility   and is an offshoot of postcolonial theory  another made up  academic  field in social sciences  which is just a bunch of people who read too much postmodernist and communist nonsense  and think they have it all figured out  when in actuality  it makes more rifts between people.the best way to bring about a sense of community is showing and allowing other groups to borrow from your own culture  which adds to the whole culture in the country in general.I could go on about this nonsense for a while  but I ll leave it here. I just hope guerilla games doesnt cater to these clowns more  and release some apology update to  fix  the  disrespectful  costumes. the first game was already subversively woke enough as is  but at least subtle enough to still be enjoyable.remember when game journalists just wrote about games  man  good times.
wow thats dumb. like dumber than the average gaming journo take.this sounds legit within the game lore.considering how well north american natives were able to survive with  for most areas was about stone age technology  it doesnt seem like a huge leap that the survivors of the apocalypse would adopt from the natives thatsurvived so well for thousands of years.
clicked for that perfect face  stayed for the cultural appropriation.
so is there a direct link from what s in the game to native americans   otherwise is the author stating that there is  and has never been  any white tribes  because Im pretty sure there s been white tribal people  and unless the game is directly pulling from a native american culture and not just tribes in general than I dont see how there could even be an arguement for this. also is that author native american or is she just deciding to get offended for other people  just curious.
of course they appropriated. native american culture is awesome.
where was this outrage 5 years ago when the first one came out
... do they not realize that most native americans today have modern  huwite  american accents  sure  there are still plenty in the older generations that tend to have more specific accents  but most natives sound just like anyone else in their region - in fact  its pretty racist to both expect and desire a stereotypical  native accent  from people who look the part  regardless of their or their family s background if we wanna go there.
of course it was.
aloy is the shit
are people offended on behalf of people of another culture  are native americans offended  how is that ok to speak for people whom they do not belong to culturally  how can someone speak on behalf of every person within their own culture  it is a game of fiction. there are countless games who use cultural elements because of a character or a setting etc. it is fiction and it has to be based on something to tell a good story. they just found something to complain about because their goal in life is to be as offended as possible to spout moral superiority over everyone else.
the salty army has your back mel lol
I d only accuse it of one thing....bland  derivative gameplay    tbh talking about this only gives these non-entities the attention they crave.
tomboy thursday let s goooooooo....... I like tomboys   women in general  I just want one for a girlfriend Im a simple man bite me.
liberal man here  its just a very cool series that makes very much getting a ps5. as for native americans a game or reboot to bravestar would be awesome minus any woke producers.
its kinda funny in a sad way  that its the wokies that are the most active at destroying work for ............. --- insert group here  a black woman cant be on and Im sorry here but as a not american I forget it was some food  and the same for a few native americans  same for what was called lane women to booth babes  we can always discuss the names of a job title  but it used to be a nice laidback job  laidback as in comparing to actual modelling that can be a very hard job  for models offseason  now vikings have to be transsexual and hollywood are still scrap feeding black actors with old 2nd hand reused roles
what about people with mix family  like mine  grandmother is native my mom is half  I am 1 4  I look more white lol but it is still part of my culture  and family
I feel that this game is guilty of culturally appropriating cavemen. as a descendant of cavemen  I am offended. I also acknowledge I set myself up for some great jokes with that line so fire away.
gaming journalists are culturally appropriating real journalists by pretending to be one.
@throgster productions  well  I am happy to hear your journey wasn t as difficult. I come from a small stature family and it took considerable time  effort  and patience. Ive found its simple but not easy.
I swear  wokies dont recognize natives unless they look and talk like the stereotype. you cantell they have never interacted with natives before lol!
modern day white people  come predominantly from europe  that was settled by a previously nomadic tribes at some point in history. because everybody was nomadic at some point. it is only with rise of farming  that people started to settle on specific locations. prior to that people foraged and hunted out one location and the moved to another.presuming that nomadic lifestyle is specific to native americans  who also actually came from aisa and exterminated those who lives in modern day americas before them  is a pinnacle of ignorance and stupidity.I played first game  I found it to be boring  due to limited degree of character development  but what else can you expect from console port. but I never even thought about native anything. my only issues were lack of variety in both character development and strategies.as far as war bonnets go  I find it funny how they are butthurt about the fact that this traditionally native american regalia is worn by aloy  whose ancestry is actually unknown  but not the fact that woman wears one. something that would be considered far bigger offense by same native americans.as far as lara croft goes  she is not strong  she is tough. muscle would not work well with her occupation.
just for the giggles I ll pretend to play along with the journalists and complain because look at all the appropriation the game does with the animals. those poor babies! you have dino-like creatures  turtles  mammoth  birds  bison  sabertooth tigers  and others who got culturally appropriated into metal robots terminator style. the game should be renamed to culture appropriator simulator.
again  they did the same thing over the first game
I didn t mind the name change because  redskin  is a racial slur  but even I never wanted them to become  the washington football team . the article complains about cultural appropriation  yet fails to realize that native culture has been largely erased  sans the mainstream  hollywood native stereotype. natives dont exist in modern american western pop culture unless its performative mourning over the cultural genocide that the natives experienced. all we are good for is pointing out how the govt white ppl wronged us over a century ago. otherwise  no one gives a damn about natives in the modern day  because our collective cultural imagery is forever frozen in the 1800s.
they ve never heard of picts  have they
the issue I have with this game is the main character. during the stone ages women were not hunters and warriors. they stayed in the caves and villages. the men went to war and hunted for food. sorry ladies  thats the way it was.
I can enjoy the game for what it is and I while I dont know that its appropriation specifically since I haven t seen any specific native tribal symbols  but something doesnt feel right about white people from europe to america profiting generation after generation after generation from the blood and off the blood and sweat of millions of people because their culture  like the characters in horizon  was  primitive  and the people were  subhuman.   then when white characters  white acting characters adopt the same types of cultures and clothes its like  no harm  no foul right  there s been no substantial effort made to repair any of the damage thats been done that I can see.just because melonie is fine with being told she s backwards  but straight up white people doing the same aren t doesnt make it right either.sam bradford  as a pro nfl qb  said he would never have worn a washington redskin uniform.
today as almost melonie s mike go boom
thier ethnocentric paternalism is off the charts
itseems like they gotta complain about anything with strong female leads that aren t  woke  enough.
goodness girl.... youre looking especially cute today. but no worries...I know youre not here to be easy on the eyes for me!! lol! booooom!!!!
do they not even know about european hunter-gatherers
I thought she was dressed like a north england pict.
good video. horrible take on aloy as a character lol
dont believe in not sharing culture so that will have to be an impasse im danish I was raised differently im proud of sharing mine also as a sidenote I dont remember ever being even asked if you could use norse Gods or vikings hell the first is a practiced religion yet no one pays that any notice as they pervert itsee marvel for examples
hey mel I just want to tell you that why is there so much of hate between the native american culture   non native american culture  anyway I do wish that we all should be respectful   nice to the native american culture   quit being so evil to them   love them as they want to be loved  ok mel. anyway I do hope you understand what I am saying to you and hope you understand what I am saying bout this topic  ok mel. anyway I do hope you have a wonderful   great blessed day today at the gym   at home with your pets  ok mel.
do you shoot firearms like lara croft does
game editor and chief  what what
aloy is an irish man...
stop the world - I want to get off. smh
maybe they are saving that argument for peta
bahahhhh! thank you. boom indeed  d
those guys are right  there  plenty of native stuff in this game but no cowboys.  where are the cowboys in this game   there s robots  but no pirates... horizon needs to get on the ball here.  they didn t make my game they made a game and left it up to people to decide whether they want to buy and play it themselves.... how dare they.  lol
love ya sweety!  3 .... that is all
isn t this game pretty woke too  they eat themselves.
its the washington commanders though btw
native americans have a monopoly on tribal society and primitive weapons clothing - the wokies  2022
good job they re not wearing kilts...... nah I dont care really  you wanna wear a kilt  rock on  gotta go commando though
does taco bell appropriate mexican culture  lmfao these people dont let anyone have nice things.
this aloy looks like brian stelter  changemymind
Im curious  what percentage of native american are you
they accuse horizon forbidden west of appropriating native american culture but when marvel did that very thing with the black panther movie the woke left stayed completely silent.
you are also conservative...ish so they will come for youregardless. stay awesome though
@melonie mac go boom  remember there is only one race human race - rest is called cultures
peoples        to quote tropic thuder  you wouldn t say chineses
go boom everyday!
if this makes them mad  let s see how mad they get when they realize eminem is  by their logic  appropriating african-american culture. go on. try to cancel him.
its a Goddamn video game jfc
I remember the land o lakes squaw.  they are doing this to blacks too.
the wokies. new verbage integrated into common used vernacular
horizon forbidden cultural appropriation
all humans wore animal skins and furs
this writer didn t play the first game. theres nobody  left  they were all made by machines long after humanity was wiped out
rolls eyes  oh  cultural appropriation. youre using to many representations of greek mythology in games. my greek grandmother would roll over in her grave if I ever said anything like that.
first off my family have been mixed with native american blood for generations upon generations.  I can speak for myself and my family who play games as a hobby. and what is getting beyond fucking annoying is when people speak for others. so Im assuming these so called journalists are probably white.  we can speak for ourselves.  and trust me we are not worried over appropriation in a video game.  we are involved in powwows  you know where we educate  share our culture with others.  we teach our younger generation to speak our language and this appropriation is not high on the priority list. the problem is they have white guilt and are completely uneducated about other cultures.
how canthey appropriate a culture when no one is aware of that culture. humanity in this game was remade by machine after the extinction of life on earth.  they dont know nothing about what came before.
booom!
I didn t realize native americans made clothes and gear from robot dinosaurs.
7 57   ecclesiastes 1 99 the thing that hath been  it is that which shall be  and that which is done is that which shall be done  and there is no new thing under the sun.
oh my word people just need to complain about everything dont they  people just need to just enjoy the game for an epic adventure.
there is no discord link into your  linktree
the only thing I dont like is they made the main character look like nick avacado
daily comment for content
my goal is to comment on all your videos
keebler elves have been culturally appropriating my people for decades and no one says anything
man  anyone thinking its appropriation is soo painfully dumb. they obviously never played the game as people of various color and nationality wear those clothes. and the clothing style is a fantasy made up tribe with lots of lore.
do they think the only hunter gatherers were native americans
sigh...
they changed her look masculine anyway  but .... bending the knee is cowardice.
the game has nothing to do with american indians. its not like she can go to the local walmart to get new digs.
so  youre like .... 1 512th irish   p
as a latino they pull my latino card instantly when I spout an opinion they dont approve. so I imagine this is the same for any native americans disagreeing with this.
good point
oop my bad  I will add it! discord.gg meloniemac
king
actually looks pretty good but I ll have to wait for pc release.
more like half. figured  mac  in my name would be a bit of a giveaway there haha
@melonie mac go boom  just take this 1 512 irish narrative. Im sure youre gonna need it in case they come after you with  but muh native american appropriation .
@melonie mac go boom  also  pardon my ignorance. Im asian  so  I couldn t catch people s ethnicity by their names mostly . so  mac is quite an irish name for a woman  then. glad I learned something new. also  jeremy from the quartering sent me here. you have quite some interesting takes on today s western culture. guess  I ll stick along.
facepalm
when will these stop with this stuff.. these things they call cultural appropriation is actually cultural appreciation
they could have at least put some native americans in the game since every other race in the game
my copy pasta was a bit inappropriate I apologize
the woke mob dont buy and play games just look at bf5
its pretty obvious they didn t play the game with this ignorant article
anyone born native to a land called america is native american. most americans are native american. its better to make use of the term  american indian.
19k by sunday...
game is broken so much smog
ah yes the people of horizon are appropriating a culture that no longer exists in their universe  because all the information about them was destroyed.
oh my  distance yourself from the mic when raising your voice.
they are new natives not old natives. wow some people s children.
all of the wokies  talking points ultimately boil down to inciting racial segregation and conflict.
on base of this some ethnicities should stop using electricity  english  cars  mobile phones etc because this thing are fruit of different cultures... it is just theory not my opinion.
its a freaking game. you play them to be someone or something you are not irldamn the woke   cancel culture is really a collection of the weirdest people online
this attempt to shame people for  cultural appropriation  bs needs to fade away as it truly shows human idiocy.
there was once a time when game urinalist talk about games  now its politics and woke bullshit!
land o lakes  uncle bens and aunt jemima  pearl milling company   I wont ever buy those products again.
yeah the cultures shown is a mix of all tribe based cultures. did you know if technology is forgotten we would act like this.
the minute we find out that natives of any country had to battle robot dinosaurs for survival we cantalk about cultural appropriation. until then why be upset people
agreed. my family have always called ourselves indians  but the wokies have policed our own language so hard
I hope so
they ruin and whine about everything . let their trail of tears grease the gears of normality and God please let us return to the 90s and early 2000s
I dont think anything is culture appropriation.  we come from a culture.  we dont own it. when you attack people for stealing your culture then are perplexed when people dont celebrate it.
last time I checked  the game is fucking fictional lmao how tf does it get  cultural appropriated  when its a fictional fantasy game
funny how these  journalists  never cried about dark souls being european cultural appropriation by asians
in this game aren t they tribal humans living in america  after an apocalypse  that would make them new native americans. I cant stand journos!! smhand Im part indigenous but not us native american. my native blood is from mexico.
lots of angry people with no knowledge of respect for native american history.  my grandma was na and guess what  Im not offended!
I fear horizon 2 may have been infected by the last of us 2 woke shit. did not preorder waiting for the info on that. if the game is just a fun game with no political messages of any kind in it  im all up for playing  but if it ends up the shit that lou2 was  im passing for elden ring.
you dont read your comments
lol right who cares   omg!!! Im wearing white man cloths !!!!
when they insist non-white characters stop wearing blue jeans  practicing the empirical scientific method  using electricity  airplanes  steam engines  and internal combustion engines  then and only then will I take them seriously.
let s be real  its not the depiction of native american stuff thats the problem. its because its on aloy.....and she s white. if she was tanner and had brown hair  they would be cheering.
God makes women beautiful and the devil makes some women ugly.
Jesus never condemned appropriation.
they made a viking character black  wheres the outrage over that  vikings braided their hair and had styles similar to dreadlocks. they have taken numerous viking Gods and made them into characters for movies  even tried to own the right to the character  lokI .. thats not stealing a culture  or appropriation
the white savior  gaming  journalist   pls  natives let me be offended on your behalf im so riddled with guilt and ashamed to be white
its a game nerds! get over it!
humanity died out  there was no native american culture left....
two things. first  God gave adam and eve furs and leather clothing. second  as a member of the cheyenne  please stop trying to save my culture you know nothing about.
cringey idpol stuff aside...yeah I think this a bitsilly. what aloy wears is directly correlated to the narrative of the story in which civilization basically had to start over. it makes perfect sense thatshe d be wearing things like animal skins and pelts. she isn t using traditional indigenous language  she s speaking english. so what native americantribe is she directly appropriating here  imho I think its a little strange that these folks are claiming cultural appropriation without really identifying what culture its taking from  and painting basically all indigenous people as a monolith.it is weird that I see a lot of comments saying that cultural appropriation  doesnt exist  or  is made up.  it does exist  but that doesnt necessarily mean that it is inherently a bad thing. it becomes bad when it intentionally ridicules or reduces something s cultural significance. I dont see how that would apply at least in the game s universe because aloy or the tribes in it  dont know about any of these cultures so we can assume they either just came up with it on their own -- which is probable considering its civilization starting over -- or they emulated something they saw from the  old world  which is also understandable considering they have the knowledge equivalent to like 1500 s humanity.
I have a segment where I respond to them every day
@melonie mac go boom  omg you actually read em subbed
lol no1 cares what this woke game journos say  they have lost all credibilitygood video  we get to laugh at wokies again
what about the cultural appropriation of europeans with amazons lotr show sjws
oh no  historical accuracy is evil! I know  let s completely forget history and reality to appease the whiners of the internet!
as an archaeologist  this is utterly moronic. this  primitive  state  hmm  linked to native american peoples  this seems problematic.  describes the bulk of human history. everywhere.
yes. because only native americans ever were tribal. nobody in africa  mongolia  siberia  the amazon  or zny other place has ever been tribal.
youre not allowed to dress  cook  speak  etc like each other... and you certainly cant socialize with people who have differing values or youre a traitor to the cause.... so  you want segregation and tribalism  is what youre telling me    sigh  give me a break.
there are no  native americans . people seem to forget the land bridge that brought all these people here.... mostly of french and siberian descent. nothing here was native.
boring game anyway.
could the wokies please stop appropriating the race card ... and the critical thinking skills of my tribal ancestral neanderthals ... ... ... ...
thats just one theory
