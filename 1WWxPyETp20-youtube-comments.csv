so much I could say here but I ll keep itshort  Ive been watching you since 2014-15ish since the until dawn and rise of the tomb raider vids. its so great to hear your thoughts opinions on topics of this sort. its so annoying when these  wokies  will race swap a character for the sake of representation. for example  race swapping batman and making everything about the character to be  black.  I dont need to see batman as a stereotypical black man in order to relate to him. I admire bruce wayne as a character and what he s done. its not about race or gender. something Ive been annoyed with for a while  love this channel  speak your mind!
you dont have to masculinize a woman to make her powerful very well spoken.
nobody took any issue with eowyn in the real lotr movies.  she had what was probably one of the best lines of the trilogy when fighting the witch king.  he proclaimed that no man could kill him and she took off her helmet  said  I am no man  and proceded to finish him.  it never felt forced  it never felt over the top.  she was scared  she was out matched and she was getting her ass kicked as any human would against him.  that is bravery  that was powerful.  not some modern woke take where she would have been some super human warrior doing flips and whatnot.  similar to what you saw in mulan then and now.  you want to write a powerful female character  you dont do it by making them manly.
everybody just remember  this isn t tolkien  its amazon token.
galadriel was practically a demiGoddess  her magic was so powerful even gandalf bowed to her and he was a maiar  practically a personification of an angel. now she s a lvl 20 fighter and elronds a nerd  great. and what s with the the architect crap   strangers from distant lands  friends of old you  ve been summoned here to answer the threat of mordor. middle earth stands upon the brink of destruction and I have just recently designed a new gazebo
its not just the  white nerds  who are complaining about the casting. Im a filipino who has never left the philippines  and I love tolkien s work. I will tell you that the pictures from the vanity fair article made me raise an eyebrow.
I love seeing woke  reimagined  franchises turning into dumpster fires
the wokening is stupid  nonsense is always gonna be nonsense. good video mac.
cant wait to publically display my disapproval for the trailer amongst my peers at super bowl.
eowyn was badass in lotr and my 1st thought at seeing the armored galadriel was   why are they trying to make the most powerful elf in the 3rd age into eowyn   weird!
I read the books growing up and was am a huge fan of tolkien and I loved peter jackson s take on the books personally. I saw early one all the gay frodo sam stuff come out after the movies and it really pissed me off. they had a true friendship! also  I absolutely love how you are doing Bible verses at the end of your videos! as a fellow Christian gamer girl I fully support and encourage you doing this!!!!!  you should totally check out gothix on youtube as well
really enjoyed your perspective. also happy to see someone in the gaming nerd culture so open about their faith. looking forward to the next one!
I saw the video jeremy did  they re trying to preemptively blame the fans for itsucking and trying to acuse the fans of being homophobic becauase 20 years ago the actor who played gandalf was gay. Im tired of being lied to and lied about.
original galaderial was intimidating with just a look  this other one commands zero fear
you have just inspired me so much as a Christian and as a person! I struggled with how to be open and share my faith but after seeing this vid I now gained some confidence! thank you so much!!
the sad part is that in the proper Lord of the rings queen galadriel is a politician  not a tactician...and in her role as a politician she s successful and empowered  while empowering her people to have safe lives.further  40k twatter likes equals 1 sales views... now you know the exchange rate.
its almost like they wanted to go to war with the fans.
the sam frodo thing is happening because we live in a time where two people cant be good friends without being  in love ...its insane...and a big reason being gay is so popular.  children with ridiculously close friendships are told its something more...and are too impressionable to understand the difference.
as a nerdy atheist.... you madame are doing awesome. Imay not believe in everything you do....though  its nice to see some more classy wholesome nerd videos. keep up the great work!
to be for real  had amazon did do a spin off of Lord of the rings with a live action version of shadow of mordor and shadow of war  not only would it had been amazing  but mostly lore accurate and still had at least two characters which would have been baranor  real name warad  which has lore that is believable like him being a haradrim baby  found by the gondorian people and raised as one of their own and his brother jagaI aka serka being middle earth s alI baba and the 40 thieves  covered an elf assassin  eltariel that gets her own story with uruks that would be fan favorites  like maku the fixer  ogg the bow of morgoth  ar-kaius the architect and my personal favorites the boom brothers aka flint and tinder and that is not even covering the main story that would have been amazing to start with.everything that they shoe-horned in there  not only done organically and better  but would have been the mandalorian grade and the best part  they can have an infinite set of possibilities of uruk and olog characters they could use and itstill would worked as long as they stick to the game s story.
bless you
@melonie mac go boom  bless you too!
@queezy  hey man  if you haven t check out eric july aka young rippa. he s coming out with his own comic book company.
@sheepdog  yess! I follow him  I cant wait to see what he puts out
for some reason..I want to blame ion hazzikostas for the fail.  lol
bless ya brother
@warren perkins  they literally dont want to see brothers in movies brother..thats all what woke means to them.  dont worry you ll get it..just like that trump supporter pro-police brother who was killed unarmed by the police for walking while black. lol
totally.
true
galadriel in the fiction and the trilogy is amazing  the one in this is so bland by comparison and innacurate.
my grandma was the sweetest person you may ever have met  yet I believe she was the strongest in our family. her strength came from God  not herself  which is why I say she is strong.
thats a fucking epic line.
d b  not some modern woke take where she would have been some super human warrior doing flips and whatnot. similar to what you saw in mulan then and now  to be fair to mulan thats not really  woke  chinese wuxia movies have been doing wire fu shit for a long ass time. well known examples crouching tiger hidden dragon house of flying daggers and hero to name a couple western audiences probably know of. like ya mulan isnt a good movie and its disney but stylistically its pretty clearly trying to be influenced by chinese cinema not really being  woke .
tolkien tourists are leading the tour.
this practically screams   we threw a billion dollars at this
j.r.r token
@dinadan alcedines  I kinda did read the book when I was a teenager  a big old paperback trilogy which was as interesting as it was dry  I also read the silmarils. I cant remember half of what happened because its been 35 years since I read them and Im not a crazy mad fan who memorized everything. I know she was tall and strong as a man  athletic and liked to explore middle earth but to my knowledge she didn t command armies  she was a councillor  diplomat and planner.
@dinadan alcedines  lol we found one. . . . . . .
he built a she-shed to sip soy lattes while tweeting social justice
the wokening  will  probably  be written in history  even if in the psychological branch of it.
mental ilnes  I hope its not gona spread.
you are going to actually watch that dumpster fire   oh crap  they are both dumpster fires....  Imean you are watching nfl dumpsterfire....
man we may not be in the darkest timeline... but our timeline sucks a lot of ass though. time for us to create our own entertainment and start supporting new creators who aren t woke collectivists.
true.galadriel and eowyn are both brave and bold but are never the same as characters. some fans out there refuse to see that.
long over due
facts!!!
and then us men grow up learning that its wrong to show friendship with our friends. the most we can do is insult them playfully  because thats mean and manly... yeah no thanks  we can hug our friends if we want too  y know.
nothing new sadly
gurl no. 1. being gay is genetics 2. men not being able to pursue platonic intimacy has existed for over a century due to conservatism and a false sense of manhood 3. same can literally be said vice versa  when gay ppl  especially historical figures are getting straight washed
@schoe  hahahah
@glorfindel  prove me wrong tho skshshsb
@glorfindel  sure you can...but the insult thing is pretty natural too.  masculinity is abrasive...and thats a good thing.  innocent outlets for that are healthy.
they are also doing this with sherlock and is maddening.
thank you so much
there would still be a tiny bit of backlash from hardcore lore buffs but those games were beloved even messing with the lore. all you need is a good story and characters  and if they needed a soyboy they could have put sauron the deceiver in his beautiful elf form. no need to screw with beloved characters
those games are not lore accurate lmao
yeah  while those games rarely wipe their ass with lore the way I suspect amazon will  they weren t entirely accurate either. Imean  the first game starts at the black gate to the north of mordor  even though gondor stopped manning that centuries prior due to lack of man-power and inability to even secure their immediate border. the games mention all sorts of existing lore  yes  but that doesnt excuse where they shit on it.
@gandalf the grey   you actually completely missed my point. Im not saying its cannon  I am saying its more lore accurate  at least in comparison to what amazon is doing.  besides are you saying that it would not be a better version spin off compaired how they are shoe horning one thing or another is
@bwmagus  monolith did a better spinoff than what amazon is. any lotr fan will say its non-cannon  even me  but better than forcing in galadriel as a warrior when she never had to to begin with.
I feel like amazon is making this for the casual or non tolkien fans rather then the strong long term fans.Im happy you got validation today about how you were feeling and the video you made.
Ive posted this in a few other videos discussing this show. the skin color thing  and the beardless lady dwarves mean nothing to me. outright ignoring huge parts of the lore does. the problems with the amazon show as I see it are  1. the hyper compressed timeline. there s 1 700  years between the forging of the rings and the fall of numenor. 2. giving galadriel gil-galad s job as a military commander  gil-galad was also the king but never mind that. 3. galadriel as warrior princess. giving her armor and a sword when she needs neither. remember when she destroys that orc with a wave of her hand while rescuing gandalf  from dol goldur  that wasn t her ring  the elvish rings are made for defense   that was her own power. she basically is a weapon. 4. describing her as  young  brash and angry . she s 5 000 years old in the second age. 5. as you correctly point out  depicting elrond merely as an ambitious statesman. he was a warrior and he earned his place as gil-galad s herald in combat.
super bowl is going to break record today. for the most woke commercials in a single day
you do such a great job of explaining things. I hear about such stuff and have a feeling its weird but cant put it into words. its like smelling something and saying  dang...something stinks...what is it   then you lean over and say  the dog farted .  youre right!!! I knew something was off...and here I thought it was you...sorry.
God forbid they see the criticism as something other than racist or sexist. the criticism comes from a place of passion and love for any of these franchises this happens to. these are properties that were a place for us nerds and geeks to feel happy within a community when it wasn t cool to be a nerd and we re bullied for it. keep up the great content and keep up the the awesomeness.
please keep including the verses! its so refreshing to see someone in this space do that. its a reminder to many of us that we can do the same  no matter what corner of life work world we are in. not only that we can  but maybe that we should. if the word defines me  why dont I share it at every opportunity.
youre awesome  melonie. keep up the excellent work.
considering that the nfl has been rolling out the  football is gay  ads recently  I would hazard a guess that its going to be a wokefest
Im so glad I learned of your channel. thank you so much for the things you said. they reflect my ideals and gives a voice when I feel voiceless. and the biblical message at the end is beautiful.
I really like that you add your element of spirituality into your videos and the basis of how you frame your perspective. good content! thanks for sharing
I like to describe it as my shadow  and that Im comfortable with my shadow now. the main thing you need to take away from all of it though  is you need to accept that you will have  bad  thoughts and desires  and not punish yourself for them. if you get rid of one bad thing about yourself  you will still find more. it ll never end  there will always be more - and some you can never get rid of.youre not suppose to get rid of them either  just realize that you have them and not beat yourself up over them.
do youremember the thermonuclear explosion when somebody suggested recasting the black panther as a white guy   despite the comic canon that black panther actually was a white guy at one time  such emotional fragility.
thank you for your perspective. and speaking openly about your faith  easy sub. keep up the great work!
re  galadriel  I think what they may be trying to go for is that when galadriel first came to middle earth  she was much more ambitious and power hungry  which we see lingering elements of when she was tempted by the ring. but much of that would have been already settled by the end of the first age when she saw how badly she and her people messed up. second age galadriel should be much more similar to third age than first age. and thats not even addressing the fact that  as the singular most powerful magic user in middle earth  there s no reason for her to resort to close combat.
hey melonie mac. love these videos you always do. love seeing the woke ppl turning on against amazon lotr. also yes go bengals
great video with a better ending  thank you. I had to learn the hard way when I was younger that you cant blame others for your mistakes. that you need to reflect upon yourself and need to take personal responsibility and realize that if you hadn t put yourself in thatsituation  it might not have happened.  no one is perfect  no one is sinless  no one is righteous but God and Jesus. you said it best  who needs Jesus more than the sick and sinners  I know I need Jesus! xd
woke washed  is a term that I haven t heard before  but itsure fits.  it gets put in the washing machine with woke pods and comes out completely different in every way.
I cant stand anything coming out of ca so I am totally going for the bengals. plus the bengals haven t been to a super bowl in 30 years or some shyt. also  I am really enjoying your daily video drops. definitely  something to look forward to! also  cant wait for you to get that pop filter as well  lmao.
yup there was no backlash about  owyn    that was extremely exhausting filming the witch king fight scene which we can see in the appendices. she did perform pretty well and dont even need a sexy armor.
keep up the good work!  jeremy had your back and thats how I found you. glad that happened!I ll go get the wheelbarrow  to help you carry the massive balls you have sharing your faith. what a rare thing these days.
right. they are shitting on an ip for people who dont care anyway  so why do it  why pay for it  why not just make your own medieval fantasy epic
awesome facts!
there is a behind the scene documentary where peter is directing cate in the scene destroying that orc.  he tells her to keep getting more  dismissive  with each step.  like the orc is an annoying fly and no threat at all.   she obliterated that orc with an arm movement  not a sword! barefooted and no armor.  I like pete s version much better.
hello melonie!this Bible verse made me burst into tears two years ago.  I had a special moment with Christ and I love it!  thank you for sharing the verse with us.  I got watery eyes again today.  may the Lord light the way.
I dont know  I think dont think galadriel will be wearing a full set of armor at all times. we also see hear wearing a dress on another picture. she is described as fierce and leading rebellions in the silmarillion there are thousands of years between the events of the amazon series  and the ones in lotr. people evolve and change over time  affected by events in their lives. the series is set to have five seasons  there s a lot of room for character growth and development.its impossible to judge from a few pictures.the same goes for elrond  there s so much room for character growth. maybe he ll start as a young  more passive politician and grow to realize  sometimes its necessary to fight for what you believe is right  and words might not always be enough.again  there are 5 full seasons for those characters to develop.thats something got accomplished very well  the characters we ended up with were not the ones we had at the beginning. yet  there were some clues of what they would become  their character development didn t feel out of place  for most of them anyways
as a hispanic and haven t watched Lord of rings much   I think that the pandering is way too much. this show makes me want to not watch anything from the series. of course you can make anything you want but dont shove it down our throats. stop pandering and get this make a good fucking show moive!
I remember back in the day how we d make joke meme s and gifs about sam and frodo being gay.maybe life will imitate art once again
you kind of choked me  up there at the end. thank you for that message
not much of a tolk fan  but I did enjoy the movies for the amount of beauty they portraited. I feel that if the woke wanna portrait their perfect idea of a story  they need to use their own story and stop taking what belongs to others and twisting it to their view.
pulling for cincImyself. would like to see them succeed for the first time  realistically since the 90s.
this channel is a wonderful thing
I love critical drinker s opinion on this. there are cultures south of mordor that are already existing that they could have expanded on  but no. they had to insert their own ideals on an already existing work.
the most incredible thing  is that the original Lord of the rings managed to make the  feminine  looking elves and the princess-like women well they were actually princesses or at least high hierarchy women   look badass and alpha as fuck  the main line of elves as against sauron  the fricking archers at helms deep  eowyn and arwen dispite the later created some turmoil xd   they were all given agency  they all get their fair share of bravery........ they could have given us and really expanded the lore with the mountain man  the haradrim and the easterlings  that are barely touch in the books or movies  but naaa  naaaa lets just slap some diversity were it wasnt........ lazy as fuck
woke wash  basically encompasses everything thats happening in recent years within the entertainment industry. Im going to start using that from now on.
galadriel is so powerful thatshe was able to resist the ring.
by now  fan hate is baked into all woke products marketing budgets.
love youre figuring out through your religion!  I do not share your beliefs  and dont care.  but your explanation is so true!
never thought I d die standing side by side with a crazy psychopath yandere.
great video. just found your channel today. I am definitely going to check out more of them.
original  the real  galadriel didn t need armor to be powerful  she literally wields a ring of power  nenya  and has powers stronger and older than the first age  why would she need a suit of armor...   owyn was a mortal woman that would need a suit of armor in battle like all of the species  man  in tolkiens middle earth. galadriel   owyn  and arwen are my favorite characters throughout the entire series. the  hell yeah  moment where  owyn kills the witch king of angmar after saying  I am no man  was awesome. why are they destroying these amazing female characters and replacing them with weaker versions of themselves. armor never made these characters strong  their internal willpower and courage is what made them strong. Im a 151kg strongman and I found the older female and male characters to be stronger than the new ones in every way. period. this reboot is a sick joke.
cant wait to see your reaction to that trailer.
you said it very well. I heard about you through the quartering. anyways  I do feel that this so called wokeness is nothing but pandering. Im only gonna watch the pilot. see what its like  then I draw my own conclusion. thats all we can do. we all have the choice what we watch. I like it that you do a verse at the end.
Im a steelers fan aswell Im pulling for cincinnatI bangles.thank youmelonie for everything you do your awesome.
@melonie mac go boom thats not you! check this out!
so its not really going to follow the source material all that well  is what youre saying.
the rings of power come fairly late in the book  so maybe she doesnt have it yet  but still  those old elves were so badass they make legolas look like a amateur.
@bwmagus  true  thats why Imentioned her magical power older than the first age  and damn right  I suppose you do tend to get quite powerful after living for 8300  years as an already powerful elf. just baffles me that they would think galadriel of all elves would need armor  and then to use the argument of   owyn also having armor so what s the problem  is mind boggling. she was badass the way she was originally designed as a character  why change that
because of the woke destroying all these franchises  we ve managed to get some of the other youtubers into anime. let s find an anime melonie would like. she liked lotr  let s start with goblin slayer and record of loddoss war.
bless you for the little sermon at the end
they forgot its a fantasy story  not a reality show.
never been one to simp  but you make it very challenging not too  mel. glad to see you landing on your feet.
going for the bengals!!! enjoy your time with your brother s house and prepare for some yelling lol. I love lotr but this new one is not to my taste. I love how you speak your mind thats why this channel rocks!!! if this cancel culture messes with you again we gotz your back for sure!!! have fun my queen!!!
your someone I would want my daughter to listen to.
@melonie   I appreciate you are planting seeds as part of your ministry into your videos.  peace and blessings to you in y shua
I ll say this again I copied this and saved it in notes because I knew I d use it multiple times will poulter was supposed to play elron and a much better choice. will actually looks like hugo weaving. as for galadriel  she s the most powerful elf in the 3rd age. even elron is scared of her silent ferocity. its such bullshit thatshe would ever wear armor or use a weapon. she stayed out the wars because her power was so great that war could corrupt it and her like it did to sauron and the witch king before. as for the dwarves  they have a grayish white complexion because they live inside the earth. they dont have melanin. and yes  the women have beards. which could have been a really good and fair win for transgender people. but no  they have to force diversity instead of stick to lore. there are darker skinned men in the east. and the show could have had an awesome story arch about the blue wizards  who have almost zero lore unfortunately  by following the wizards to the east and have their diversity there. where it actually was in tolkien s world. this is very disrespectful to tolkien and his actual  not just bandwagon woke mobs  fans.
love the content  keep it up. even the religious doctrine discussion  atheist here  is based in logic and interesting to hear.
exactly  couldn t of said it any better myself!
Im from cleveland and we re all browns fans of course but our bowling alley erupted with applause when the bengals beat the chiefs 2 weeks ago.
I love drinker s point in his recent video  you dont need to swap genders or races of established characters  you can create your own. but its easier to cannibalize someone else s work.
so I have a childish sense of humor but this is what popped in my head. when you were talking about the pharisees. I think the verse is  remove the log from your own toilet
I cannot wait for frodo to share his ring with gollum.
that biblical message has come up from several sources this past week. thanks for the confirmation.
love the addition of religion  I always need reminders.
I just now realized that they pretty much interchanged elronds and galadriels characters..
evil cannot create anything new  they can only corrupt  - j.r.r tolkien
while the show looks like dumpster fire  a couple of things  I thought elrond was made into too much of a badass warrior for the movies. he was mostly a scholar. rivendell was established after he had to retreat after getting beaten badly  and saved by the dwarves . gil-galad was the elven badass in the last alliance  elrond was kind of his squire. I have no idea where they are getting galadriel as the commander of the  northern army  the only one Im familiar with gets absolutely destroyed and is not led by her. her wearing armor  no problem. carrying a sword  no problem. using the sword regularly in the way of say gil-galad or glorfindel  problem  big problem. she is badass enough as is  the bit of her on the ice in the promo is one of things that is faithful to the lore  she did cross a massive ice field. some of the detractors of the show though  are showing massive ignorance in even talking about frodo or saruman  both of which will absolutely not show up in the show  it is thousands of years before saruman even shows up . some even have a problem with galadriel claiming she is going to have mary sue magical powers... despite her being thousands of years old and well tested by this point in time.
I quit western entertainment years ago. someone wake me up when woketember ends.

I think many people erupted with cheers when they knew that the chiefs had been beaten.
this morning in church my pastor tackled the very difficult topics covered in luke 16 1-13! these passages discuss the idolatry of money and the sin of divorce! but as always  he handled it with compassion and grace! it was a great service!
religion or not  people need to love each other and try to be a good person every day.
I thought they canceled it already
I love how you end your videos with a Bible verse and talking about the word. I am happy that jeremy put me onto you take care
wise and funny  thnx for your take on this.
screw what others think. always someone not going to be happy. thats just life
I want the bengals to win just because I love tigers. I know its a ridiculous reason but I stand firmly behind my logic. when I was a kid growing up the nfl had official clothing and I always wanted one of those kickass pullover hoodie jackets. and the offical team merch for clothing at the time had those crazy tiger striped pants in the team colors. I loved the bengals merch because it was actually the right color for tigers  so the bengals always had a special place in my heart just for their aesthetic.
a mac a day  keeps the woke away !
I didn t realize when I saw the woman in armor that that was supposed to be galadriel. thats ridiculous.
I agree with your points melonie
unfortunate turn of events. however thank you for the Bible verse. just found your channel. cheers
sam and frodo are a couple ... uhh  before they leave the shire  sam is into rosie. after they get back  he marries rosie. has kids with rosie. sam is the kinda friend everyone should strive to be   and should be blessed to have in their lives. if sam is into frodo... he s bi.
glad to hear this
nooooo Im a ravens fan  I guess I can make an exception for you melonie haha and Im going for the begals just cos I want cincinattI to win over an la team haha
its like amazon went and said  how can we make our version of marvels  what if  lotr intro
its gonna bomb. even normies are getting tired of woke shows.
I love that you end the video with a Bible verse.
Im hoping if we ignore this and not watch it  it will go way.
yikes  they really gave galadriel a default valkyrie look
this dumpster fire is already visible from orbit.
youre awesome. love the end of this  d
great thoughts! keep it up.
the power of money over something that a person never created but owns it. thought inheritance.  this guy who is letting this happen. earned his money the old fashion way  he inherited it!
we ll see  we ll see. if twitter speaks for the majority  then they really shouldn t feel so threatened by a few old school fans.
subbed because Godpilled
personally speaking I already got what I wanted with the peter jackson film franchise. nothing the amazon prime series tries to attempt will ever hold a candle to what jackson and his team at weta accomplished.
another example of gaslighting Ive been seeing lately is people who say things like   what is this wokeness you speak of  and can you give a working example of it   straight up denying everything from the last decade s worth of fan abuse.
the best question to ask them.  how would you feel if shaka zulu was cast as a white man  or better yet as a white woman
love the reflection  thank you for quoting the Bible  keep up the amazing work
we are not going to let them get away with this
still trying to decipher your tattoos through watching your videos as well.
your daily consistency is showing and starting to pay off. your first video was great  you have talent and a knack for this. but this video seemed more fluid. youre starting to delve into your platform  cutting excess fat and focusing on essentials  imo. lol am Imaking sense idk the frequency you aired on your previous platform  but if it wasn t daily  I think thats a subtle discipline you are benefiting from  now.
it appears they swapped galadrial s and elrond s backstories
its simply pandering to the  woke  mob. they do this a lot lately. they take a canon and twist it or totally flip it to suit their agenda. its not enough thatshe was already a powerful confident female character  they had to totally change the characters to something that was never intended by the author. then they label the true fans as  insert trending ism  to justify their bs.
I dont watch Lord of the rings but I know cringe when I see it and yea the fans are wilding. sometimes certain changes dont need to be made to peoples art. although obviously its peoples choice to watch and invest in the movies and etc. once they see some people dont like the changes and the writing they are gonna scrap it.  no matter what they change or names they call people  media lives and dies by audience investment. if people dont like it or dont give a shit it wont be invested in or keep going.
lets make a super powerful female character into a normal person.. its like having a female dr. strange who cant do any wizardry.
hey this is the first video of yours Ive seen. I was shocked by the little Bible study at the end  but I absolutely loved it! thats incredibly bold of you to include like that  and I hope the Lord uses it. youre probably sick of this but what denomination are you  if you have one  or are you catholic  I assume not brethren since we dont normally have pastors. I dont ask so I can nitpick your beliefs  I just am always curious about it  so that I can understand where peoples reasoning comes from more fully. cant wait to meet you in heaven!
your scientists were so preoccupied with whether they could  they didn t stop to think if they should.
I think elrond is going to become the masculine figure from lotr due to lady gal bc you know a man cant become strong on his own volition with out a woman giving him the ok
evil cannot create anything new  they can only corrupt and ruin what good forces have invented or made.
thank you!    I go to a non denominational   evangelical church
@melonie mac go boom  hey thats awesome! I basically said it but I go to a brethren chapel  myself. not nearly enough evangelism over here  but we ve got other strengths. glad to know Ive got another sister!
wow! great to see you end the video with a Bible verse. may God prosper you in your future endeavors.
tell us more of this carnivore diet  also  happy birthday .
get ready for netflix s woke narnia
oh I love the image of galadriel that chick is hot af and a good choice. but I dont get how armour and weapons are more  empowering  than galadriel s real power  the ability to see into the mind and strip it bare. any dope can swing a sword but only a powerful elven queen can destroy you from the inside out.
Lordofthewoke
I call the actress who s cast as galadriel bubblegum girl. it looks like she enjoys chewing gum. not my idea of a powerful 4000 year old elf.
heh  tolkien isn t around to set the record  straight  about frodo and sam  I dont think you meant that as a pun  but I laughed.  d
not even his son can consult this mess. rip
whenever youre not agreeing with what garbage they turn out  you get called an  istophobe  of some kind. at this point  3 4 of the world must be an istophobe of some kind according to them. sad really. what bothers me in the entire thing is that they dont respect the lore one bit. if the actors can hold the role well and actually smash it and if the story is good and within lore  then I dont give two shits about race. however  the way this looks  we re not getting even that.
just like jack kirby s kids telling stan lee he had no rights to characters he created and couldn t use the word mutant this shit has to cease. boycott it.
I just want to see that halftime show  my favorite line up in my entire life
ever follow supernatural  on twitter there is a sizable group that insist on the winchester brothers being a couple. Imean they re brothers fcol.
the quartering sent me here  your content made me stay
they ve already killed any desire I have for watching the show whatsoever
they deliberately take away what little we hold dear and then when we get rightfully sad mad about it they insult ustell me if this isnt bullying and being toxic then wtf is it I fkin had mad respect for our lady galadrielshe was elegant  wise  powerful  pure  dependable   fiercehow dare they do this to her...her own words  in place of a dark Lord you would have a queen  not dark but beautiful and terrible as the dawn  stronger than the foundation of the earth  all shall love me and despair  now canthis new galadriel claim any of those things  no ofc not! except  thatshe has  beautiful face which really wasnt the point...
how good were the women in Lord of the rings already .....so strong  and so feminine at the same time!
nailed it! the new galadriel looks like an nfl linebacker  not a powerful elven maiden.
the amazon lotr series just doesnt exist to me
preeeaaaach. Im so happy to have found a based gaming channel that is run by a Christian. so many are either atheist or agnostic  and they re fun to watch  but its just good to know Im not alone
one more reason I deleted my twitter.
bahahahahahahahqhahaha
at the end of the 2nd age there was  the great cleansing   it is something that the elves and dwarves do not speak  of openly.
cinema galadriel was definitely more powerful looking than armored tv version. cinema version screamed  magically mighty . this show is doa.
Im a movie nerd my whole life  had a massive dvd collection and sold it all off after streamig came around. but since the basterdisation of modern cinema I lost all interesst in movies
on of the best moments in the lotr trilogy was  owyn saying  Im no man   this is what female empowerment sounds like!
I like you  I think I should subscribe. I lost my faith a little  and I like to see someone on yt who is not afraid to put Bible verses in videos that are not about religion. maybe this even helps me a little bit.
the comments section on the new trailer is hilarious  just a constant stream of  evil is not able to create anything new  it can only distort and destroy what has been invented or made by the forces of good  - j.r.r. tolkienI imagine amazon will upload a new video and disable comments.
if we can get enough people to write a positive review while praising donald trump in the same paragraph we might be able to shut this production down
when you spend so much time pouring your soul into giving black women dwarf representation you forget the beards
you   the critical drinker  need to get together   swap notes.I cant wait for the orcs to come mincing over the hill waving their nail files in a mildly inoffensive way.
I was pulling for the half time show  but all those rapper and eminem couldn t even make a new rap song.
I ll never understand how they can say that a person is a racist misogynist homophobe etc when true fans protest against their opinions..... smh
what the defenders of wokism fail to realize is that tolkien fans wouldnt want to see legolas look more masculine like elrond. we wouldnt want to see arwen be portrayed more like galadriel. we just want accuracy.calling this crap middle earth is the same as calling ice ice baby an under pressure cover.also we are sick of real world politics invading our favorite fiction.
supposed to be a trailer today for amazons bastardised lotr .any sign of it
the funny thing is that I always thought cate blanchett was too old and plain to portray galadriel.  but compared to this travesty  she s perfection.
the first time I ever heard sam and frodo being gay was in clerks 2 and randal made the guy puke
yep  it wasn t enough for the wokies to have eowyn as a strong woman  as tolkien portrayed her  or have gandalf played by a gay man  and nobody cared because he was true to tolkien s work.
galadriel needed nerfing and not empowerment
honestly I didn t know that was supposed to be elrond before watching this video... I thought it was a young legolas. xd
if it doesnt say  edited by Christopher tolkien and illustrations by alan lee  its not tolkien  I wont add it to my library.
can somebody please explain what the issue is with the image of galadriel
he has great taste in tomb raider - for that reason alone I will respect anything he says from here on out
because they are everything they claim you are...its literally projection on thier part.
john howe and ted nasmith
your a steelers fan - not optimal but acceptable.go bengals.
Im disgusted that galadriel has a feanorian star on her armor..absolutely insulting.
excelent v deo. hello from brazil. God bless you...
its called creative license.  its allowed.we re casting frida karlsson in the role of harriet tubman and Christopher walken as uncle tom.
of course your twitter is in steelers colors.
thinking a lot about john 4  Jesus and the samaritan woman at the well. she may have thought of herself as a failure because she wasn t in a successful marriage and was likely a social outcast. however  Jesus s comments to her about how she didn t have to let it define her  but how she approached God was more important. Jesus called her to recognize that a life of joy and peace is possible  but only when we take our focus off ourselves and put it onto the savior. you will never have peace if you live by what society says is acceptable  only by what God says is good for you.
off topic  are you a paper book tabletop rpg gamer  if you are  I think it would of been cool if you were a member of the rpg group I was in back in the day  1986-1997 group slowly moved a part going their own way . b.t.w.  all have sinned and come short of  the glory of God     let he who is without sin throw the first stone    your sins are forgiven  go and sin no more . and no Im not a Christian  haven t claimed to be a Christan or preyed to  that  God sense 1984  but yes I can hold my own in a theological  king james version  debate using both the old and new  testaments .
so were sam  rosy and frodo in a menage a trois.
its so weird that they cast this seemingly perfect candidate to play galadriel  a beautiful  fair  elegant  slightly exotic looking woman  only to deliberately fuck up so much else  from putting her in plate armour to blatant blackwashing.its like they are rubbing it in people s faces.
yet you ask them the definition of it and crickets. yeah and frodo was the chad cause at end he was like f ck this sh!  Im out. and leave his butt buddy sam. lol.
lawd uv da rangs. but honestly it doesnt even give me lotr feels. it gives me generic narnia-looking fantasy movie feels. lotr was a lot more than just a fantasy movie trilogy and the world was so much than just a fantasy world. its hard to explain  the lotr movies felt different than others that came before it.
there are temptations all around us everyday. God will always give us a way out  but if we do fall into temptation  Jesus Christ is quick  to forgive and forget. when we truly repent. God is so great!
lotr fans get ready to be called toxic for not liking amazon s lotr.
tolkien was very specific how elves  and dwarves  looked. when a black elf has a fade  haircut  like I do. it doesnt take me into middle-earth. they didn t care about tolkiens legacy  just pushing woke political bs.
new mike stand is waaaay better! lol amazon Lord of the rings is going to be trash. they literally cant help themselves when it comes to injecting their politics into everything. its awful
bruh  the dumbest take Ive heard was  they re adding some spice to it  and whites are mad!  no  becky  Im not mad. annoyed  sure. Im only made that the dwarven women dont have beards.they need those. its part of the lore.
I feel sorry for young people growing up with these crap versions of great movies we grew up with. the current gen wont have any original classics to look back on! just recycled ideas to target the nostalgic middle aged generation! we dont need any if this rubbish! we need new stories! and if those stories are diverse! fantastic!
when I think of galadriel I think of thatsaying  the prettiest flowers have the sharpest thorns  probably butchering the saying but you know what Imean
it really ticks me off when film studios and television studios make programs to suit the woke they dont really give it toss about political correctness but when it affects their bottom line they do so they will carry on until everyone goes onto the new big issue. and there s another movie they want a screw up and that is james bond series they want bond now to be a woman but ian fleming the writer of the books never had bond as a woman so they are trying screw up that movie as well are we getting to a point that all males are removed from movies especially if they are straight white are hot on you cant be racist or sexist towards a white straight male can you stop the planet I want off.
what if we rewrote broke back mountain and made them straight
I really hope thats just a neat star and the designer didn t know what that would mean. maybe its meant to be a silmaril  but even then  why bother  galadriel came to make a kingdom of her own  not to help her relatives find the jewels...
@glorfindel   galadriel refused to give feanor her hair so he could cast them into the silmarillion s... she would not be wearing anything representing them.
Im ok with elrond being portrayed differently as long as he gets a character-arch. but I doubt amazon has that kind of writing talent. we ll see Imight be surprised.portraying galadriel as glorfindel is at best bad writing
heb. 4 15 Jesus Christ was tempted in all things yet without sin. he understands what we go through.   1 corinthians 10 13  just remember that with every temptation God has made a way out. that is one of the benefits we received with that new birth.
amazon s Lord of the rings bought to you by j.r.r token
this is the me generation where they need representation in everything they see or else they cant relate.  I didn t need to see a white male in boyz in the hood  juice and new jack city to relate and love those films.
a gamer and a Christian! ! I knew it was a good idea to subscribe.
ignoring the fact that in middle earth dwarven women rock beards that make me jealous  I am trying to not be too disgusted at their approach to the stories of middle earth. I just dont understand the approach to galadriel and elrond. galadriel was terrifying and powerful in fellowship of the ring as a fair maiden. the book and the movie. and elrond was a bad arse. a warrior among warriors who was also kind and gentle. it boggles the mind why they take already well-established stories  and then throw them through the woke machine. making women masculine  and men emasculated. I am getting very tired of them taking some of the greatest stories of all time  and changing them to fit a narrative that pleases a particular minority. as for the trailer  it was a royal mess. could not even tell what the basis of the story was. once again  great video melonie. I am grateful that you ve been freed up to give your thoughts on the woke trends destroying our favourite stories  games and entertainment.
I want the rams to win because matthew stafford deserves a break after being loyal to detroit all those years and not being given a chance to show just how good a quarterback he is.  plus he s a standup guy.  I like burrow  but he has a long career ahead of him.  the bengals can win next year.  I usually just pick a team each year randomly  because the Im afraid the panthers are never going to get there again.as far as the lotr thing - the shills will be coming out in full force tomorrow  and the labeling of critics has definitely begun.  this show is growing more and more divisive each day - even more so than the wheel of time one could ever imagine.  I wrote a post to put up in the show s subreddit about all the toxicity asking people to chill  but I dont know.  seems like its a waste of time to share words that no one wants to hear.about yesterday s episode - if anything  I guess I was reminded of the struggle I have  but most importantly what you shared   especially those scriptures - because the word is what changes us right  - actually gave me a lot of encouragement and reassurance  after I processed it.  so thanks for putting that out there.  I know my position in Christ and I know that I am a sinner saved by grace through faith alone who unfortunately has this thing Im going to struggle with my whole life  and its already given me so much grief  or rather I have tried to take care of it on my own too many times instead of giving him my burden  and its bruised and battered me.  anyway - I appreciate what youre doing at the end of each episode.  plus  funny thing  I listened to a sermon on this same passage about the calling of levI today.  no coincidences  right

oh dang  on my next car license plate renewal Im getting a custom plate  ist man. huh   !!! what you all think !
diversity is awesome  but not forced  illogical and untrue to the authors universe.differences in culture and apperreance are exciting and interesting. furthermore absolute logical  considering they ve been developing apart from onanother and some live in the snowy mountains and some in deserts. in different climates. and middle-earth aint a mirror of modern society. I honestly wonder about people approving woke stuff and forced diversity. diversity makes our world and middle-earth all the more interesting. you see a pale person and think of the far north  you see someone with darker skin and wonder from what distant lands he comes from. if every race and every region has people that have the same hair  skin  clothing etc. its boring.example  you see a man from kh nd in the far south. he is an adventurer. you see how different he looks and what strange clothing and weapons he wears. automatically you fantazise about what his homeland is like and what lies in the far countrys outside middle-earth. thats exciting.if everyone has the same amount of diverse people it would be boring. that man wouldn t be exciting....you wouldn t notice  that he came from another culture and just say   oh look  there is someone who looks like some of our hobbits and some of our elves...oh and like some of them dwarves. differences are natural and not everybody needs to be presented everywhere. if you think every native-american movie needs a white hero  cuz youre white...thats dense. if you think every fantasy inspired by northern mythology needs a black person  cuz youre black...thats dense.if you think every historical movie needs a homosexual  cuz youre homosexual...thats dense. if you think every hero movie needs a more powerful female version  cuz youre female...thats dense. people are reducing  disrespecting and discriminating themselves the most  by not being happy or not being able to enjoy movies etc. without  their  likeness.embrace differences amongst us and dont limit the art cinema  writing etc. for forced representatives everywhere.we are different....why must that be a bad thing. love
wait  there s another strawman take on critical drinker using that exact image  I just mocked a different one not a few hours ago. this is gonna be a long day.
let s go bengals!!!! I dont say it jokingly
nice jay jay the jet plane pic! xd
Im quite enjoying the dumpster fire.
afc north! too much politics in nfl sadly. still right on! what did your dad do in the army btw  I was a cav scout and my dad was a field artillery officer
Im pulling for the dip and antics.  football sucks  but my friends are awesome.
here from the quartering let s gooooo
are they going to use that homely hobbit music is what I want to know     do do do doo dooo do dooooooo
Im pulling for canadian truckers
Ive seen a lot of people being mean to the elrond actor for being ugly or looking weird or whatever  which is a shame. I kinda love him as elrond  since pj cast hugo weaving who is also a fairly.. unattractive man as one of the fairest looking elves in the 3rd age. xd just following the trend of a goofy looking elrond. just hope they dont butcher his character role....
uh no  diversity is not awesome. there is no example of it being awesome.
@the candorist  did youread my comment whole diversity applied to the whole world is awesome. different animals  plants  cultures  weapons  habits  appereance and traditions in africa  different in asia etc.biodiversity is completely normal an thus their are endemic species.diversity is lame  when it means every plant  every skin colour  every hair colour  every sexuality has to be included in a local region.thats illogical and lame.
eyyy  same!
well Im not watching it for all kinds of reasons but I just dont need to know any of this stuff
the armour looks so horrible  elven armour looks way different in my mind  rather have peter jackson version of armour.edit  also short haired elves suck.
when you going on friday night tights with nerdrotic

go team
amen
cincy here...cause cool joe.  that is all.

3 the lady with all the hots with thoughts ..    haha
sorry what were you saying I was distracted by the mannequin.
when the fellowship of the ring came out I dont remember anyone white or black saying the movie was too white.
taking my girls to the beach. if it ain t the 49ers I dont care for it. and I think they might be thinking rule 34.
black and yellow!
woke agenda shouldn t be a part of entertainment of any kind  because of the fact entertainment is so we can escape the problems of the real world for short amount of time  we dont want the intolerance of the real world in entertainment
well. Im from st louis  so...go bengals! lol

@john duncan  valid point

for the rest of us  fortunately  we know that twitter isn t real-life.these harpies have no effect on us.....................
you know sauron  as annatar  the giver of gifts  is gonna bang galadriel in this series and produce a bastard offspring  - .
amazon can lose a billion on this.
oh boy the teaser trailer was bad. cant wait for the reaction.
how do you get black twitter background
if you still use the 2015 meme lady in a tumbnail  you are probably more triggered than she ever was.
hopefully there will be lots of kneeling and ten national anthems
I hope woke mob never touches planet of the apes

hmmm  and you are a smart woman  which is surprisingly rare these days.
dang are you getting 10k peps everyweek
wokies similar to pharisees - lol
this video needs a lot more thumbs up buttons. come on  yt  get rid of the useless dislike button and give me 5 more thumbs up buttons.
you know what amazon likes  money so just eat there trash rings of power and enjoy.
nice vid
heh
ah  but they do  they have plenty of effect on your media and  in some bad cases  your career.
you have no power here
its in the settings somewhere if I remember haha
@melonie mac go boom  found it  merci!
I think it looks like trash. I guess I am a racist. someone calling you racist in 2022 holds the same weight as commenting on the weather. it has been so overused it no longer has any meaning.new sub here I liked your session. interesting to get a woman take on this garbage.

just some facts  a remake of the xena warrior princess show intends to make her black  buffy the vampire slayer a new version will be black indiana jones is going to be a chick  james bond is going to be a girl  even history! henry the 8th second wife anne boleyn is black. they expect us to accept it all.and now hobbits are going to be gay and races are going to be invented for middle-earth.people are starting to say no and they re pissed

jrr tolkien s galadriel would totally destroy amazon prime s joan of arc.
mac n cheese
steelers! !
I want rams to lose because I dont want to see la burn down
Im not trying to force anything on someone but come on samwise was gat for frodo in the movies  yes he married a woman and had kids but that was the biggest twist of the shows.
hm twitter   no one cares about it lol. it ain t gonna save it.
j.r.r. token
their come back that gandalf was played by a gay man  is pitiful.  no one hates an actor acting that great!  no one cared about his personal life  because no one was watching this because of any actor s personal life.  all were judged on their performance!as for these major character changes  sheesh  nothing makes sense anymore!
came here from the quartering. haven t subscribed yet. let s check out some videos. its always nice to hear a different opinion. who likes to be inside an echo chamber 24 365  not this dude!!!
I love your videos and like the fact you are religious but please dont preach     other than that I love your message and your opinion! still sub and will continue to watch
throw it into the raging dumpster fires of mt. woke whence it came.
a common trait among hollywoke is casting uglier people.  look at the star wars sequel trilogy.  compare the new crew to the original trilogy.  poe dameron is like a walmart great value version of han solo.  at best he s plain and generic looking  like daisy ridley as rey.  and dont think this is an accident.  look at rian johnson s star wars abortion with the ugliest admiral and crew in star wars history.  he intentionally made people look ugly.  they stuffed kelly marie tran in a potato sack and messed up her hair on purpose.  they uglied her up on purpose.now look at what they ve done with elrond.  this is not a mistake.  this is an agenda.
not to be misogynistic  but the way you say inserting is pretty damn hot.
no. he isn t.
happened more so after you died and they went on their own @gandalf the grey. merry and pippin were the traditional friendship but definitely something different with sam and frodo hence why there was so many jokes about it back in the day when it came out  not hate or disgust but jokes.
few fun facts about Jesus of nazareth  did you know that he was actually born around 6 bc and not in a year 0. he died around 30 ad so he was in his mid thirties when he was crucified.
just saw the trailer....it was meh. seems like that if you are doing something this big  something already steeped in controversy  and on the biggest stage of the year for commercials that you would put forth more effort into making the first time people see your project.....less generic looking.
is your pastor steven anderson
meh I ll just re-watch the trilogy. I dont consider anything remade these days as part of the originals. it really sucks how much money is wasted making trash. maybe Im just being nostalgic but its very rare to find anything worth watching anymore.
they didn t even put in a latino because only  2 use latinx. that or the fact quite a bit voted for trump 2020. would have been funny to a least put in a joke character  these people take themselves too seriously.
ye well im not Christian.
I think woke stuff is whack...however  I cannot tell the difference between these Lord of the rings properties...maybe it looks like they wanna be game of thrones
yup ... just saw the trailer and that will be about the last bit of thatshitfest I see. and I watched the movies  read the books  listened to the audio tapes ... a lot. no way I am going to ruin my experience with this crap.
Im in the minority  I guess.... I dont watch the superbowl  and have no interest in doing so.
the same people whose head-canon is gay frodo and sam gave us personal pronouns  headmates  and more  tisms  phobics and genders that the average person would never care about in their entire lives. nuke tumbler for the sake of world sanity.
it ll suck
hobbit fan fiction will top amazon book sales by 2023
do not care about the nfl anymore.
eww burn thatsteelers hoodie
this is all on purpose  complete garbage.
make the dudes women and the women bro s.  both become much weaker.
not gonna watch it. been recommending nobody else watch either
the nfl is rigged. the super bowl is a shitshow. the officials are the weak link. watch a  Lord of the rings  extended cut  marathon  instead.
do people even want more lotr anyways  isn t it just the same story repackaged then squeezed through the corporate sphincter
this gender swapping shit is getting old. women cant just be feminine in shows and films anymore. they have to have a masculine edge to the characters. and men cant just be masculine anymore  they re increasingly be portrayed as effeminate. why are traditional gender roles always getting dragged in media.
its not a remake  its an adaptation of the silmarillion  which is basically a  book  that is a collection of 8000 of tolkien s notes that his son gathered together that gives a ton of the history of middle earth long before the hobbit happened. not that I dont expect it to suck  just letting you know.
@bwmagus I see. by remade I basically mean reused in any way. they just want to capitalize on old popular stuff.
I will watch it tomorrow morning I can never get past the appalling half time borefest.
there s thousands of years of stories in middle earth  not just lotr
@gandalf the grey  yeah but they re making a lotr tv show  no
everyone has to be a mix of everything! no individuality.
I refuse to spend money on this garbage  produced by these hacks who are half-assing it...I will find other ways to watch it..or probably skip it all together...
niggalas xd
your usage of the terms  strawman  and  gaslight  literally hurts my soul. please stop throwing these terms around and using them so casually in situations that dont actually warrant them. its coming off as though youre just using them as buzzwords to get your audience going.
even disregarding the message  this looks so generic and tryhard and dumb...
why you talk about Jesus  Jesus!
if the characters make sense   Im all for it.  but if its just to check off diversity boxes  then its just garbage.   wokeness has ruined everything.
yawn... next!
if you believe that  you d actually explain how she misused them  so she could learn. if you just say  youre wrong...buh bye!  well  thats not going to do anything.
sure thats no problem. a straw man only ever occurs when a counter argument is being made  or an original argument is being distorted in some way that mischaracterizes it. in the example melonie gives  the person on twitter is making a generalized observation  not presenting an argument. she s creating an abstraction  but its not a straw man. its more of a semantical error  but its incorrectly applied here.the one that is more egregious in my opinion is usage of the term  gaslighting   and I see melonie do this often where she uses the term very loosely when she is talking about opinions she disagrees with  making itseem as if the wokescolds are making people question their own reality  when that just isn t the case. we know they aren t actually gaslighting because you literally made a video with the purpose of criticizing those same people you think are doing the gaslighting. its gaslighting when the party who is being lied to is questioning their own sanity. its a tactic used by abusers and demagogues in order to cause chaos and distress. when you use terms like this so loosely  they lose their value and become meaningless  see semantic satiation . this is especially bad for a word like  gaslighting  because it minimizes real victims of abusive relationships because youre equating their actual pain to trivial nonsense like the above. I was gaslit for years  and it caused me great psychological trauma that I am still dealing with to this day. I dont think its intellectually honest to equate what I dealt with for years  to some folks on twitter angry over some pictures of a fantasy world. even if this fantasy world is very near and dear to some folks  hey I love tolkien too  and for the record  I also think the show is going to be shit  itstill is wrong to use such a heavy term in this situation. it comes off as disingenuous and virtue signaling to your audience  especially since you put it on the thumbnail and in the title.
