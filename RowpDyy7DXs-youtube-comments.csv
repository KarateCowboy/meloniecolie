fnt folks are awesome  glad you ve joined them.
melonie was brilliant on fnt yesterday. you can sense the exuberance whenever she in a guest on anybody s show. would be a great addition to fnt!
I always felt the perfect criteria for finding the perfect lara croft tone of voice is simply having experience as a mother. that tone that judith gibbins and keely hawes brought to lara s dialouge with her advisries that felt like a mother talking with a cheeky child testing her boundries. a calm tone thatsays  you are not in charge  I am the one in charge and thats just the way it is somewhere in that instinct to assert authority as a parent  lies the heart of the power in lara s presence if you can channel it right.well thats how I always felt anyway
hayley atwell has been my pick for live action lara for years.she s got the right accent  the right cup size and has action experience as agent carter.plus she actually likes the character and wanted to do it.sadly we got stuck with that other one.
awesome job on fnt melonie and congratulations on 30k subscribers!!!!
Im very sorry you did not make it to the next round  mel. I personally felt that you and beatemups had the best designs and that you two should have been in the next round. you did an amazing job getting to the semifinals  mel! proud of you friendo!
you were awesome on fnt! that is my favorite content to watch every friday night. I sure hope you come back on again! you made it go boom!
thanks for talking about stress melonie!yeah Ive been pretty stressed out moving from southern california where I was born and raised to dfw texas area. its hard leaving family and friends behind to a new state where my job moved to.
here because of fnt. you were great  didn t seem overwhelmed by them  some guests seem to be and put your 2 pence in. hope you go on regular.
g day melonie just wanted to say great work on fnt  hope they get you back more  and you become a regular  on the show like chrissie  and az did  cheersjames d
thanks for sharing your faith  Im struggling with mine must be all those years being indoctrinated with religion growing up    also sitting down just randomly reading the Bible is so boring to me as is reading in general  plus  Im dealing with severe ocd   cant work  but  watching your videos is helping me you make it fun   enjoyable. thank you
I love that you are happy for the people that beat you.  of course you wanted to win  there is no doubt.  you show the grace of good sportsmanship.  not blaming anyone  not complaining  etc.  congrats on making it this far!
my family is Christian and my mom is a huge fan of halloween. one year  when I was growing up  we went to a new church which didn t celebrate halloween  and my mom was convinced by the other church goers to not celebrate it that time  so none of us did. however  the year after that  and every year since  she and the rest of us went back to celebrating it because she and the rest of us just couldn t resist!
if you were in the last four in the competition  that was the semi-final  not the quarter-final  so you did even better than you thought! well done anyway  keep up the great work!
hayley atwell would ve been perfect 10-15 years ago  especially if you consider the trend towards multi-year sequels.a lot of actors actresses perfect for roles that the industry dragged their feet on and missed the golden time frame.
it was awesome watching you at fnt!! hope you show up there again in the future  keep rocking!
was great seeing you on fnt. I watched the whole thing and you gave some good insight. nice job.
my nephew s birthday and mine are coming up and we re going to see jujutsu kaisen. its gonna be great  I love getting to spend time with the little guy and its cool to be able to connect with him. you fit right in on fnt and it was great to see you there. you seemed comfortable and engaged which some guests have a hard time with. Im sure they ll have you back. grats on the 30k  cheers to 30k more!
was excited to see you on fnt and you didn t disappoint.  not easy keeping up with those guys   but youre a natural.  cant wait till you get back on.  glad you had fun.
hey melonie I just want to tell you that you did a fantastic job with the streaming show on fnt last night  friday  and I was glad to watch you be interview on the streaming show too. anyway I also want to say that hayley atwell doing a voice of laura croft will be great and excellent thing for her to do  ok. anyway also I loved and liked to watch the tv show jujutsu kaisen too bc the subtitle that is in english to see what they are saying in other language on the show. anyway also I just want to say that I am sorry that you didn t make it to next round to the contest. anyway I thought you did a fantastic job with the contest and I thought you were able to make to the final round and win but you didn t make it and so I was so truly happy for you  ok melonie. anyway I just want to tell you that. anyway I just want to say bout this topic  ok melonie. anyway hope you have a wonderful and great blessed evening at home with your pets and have a good night melonie.
whats fnt
friday night tights
@farhan rahman  nerdrotic  geeks and gamers and the whole gang gather each friday. really fun.
she s only voicing her as it is animated  but still I think she would make an amazing live action lara too
@melonie mac go boom  yeah I know its only animated.she should have been cast as lara ten years ago.
next time around  there has to be at least one english cross-fit girl who can act who d make a fine lara.
@j p  thicc sounds like the opposite of lara croft.
@audiogardenslave  play the og she s kinda known for it
@mike pc  the real croft would be over 50 years old by now. for what its worth  I wouldn t mind if it was live action.
Im sorry you didn t get to the finals but we are all proud of you for making top 4! youre getting some great merch still! petition for your own shaker cup!
nice to see you and ddaycobra on a video. saw jujitsu kaisen in the title and wanted to hear what you had to say. Im looking forward to the new season of bleach and the final episode of attack on titan is tomorrow.
this was the lazy day video I needed.  I watched jujutsu kaisen in just a couple of days because it is one of the best shows ever.  I cant wait to see 0.  I hope she gets more screentime in season 2  because I think kugisakI is one of the best written girls in anime right now.  also  speaking of meat  do you miss the doubledown sandwich from kfc
you got lucky with just some sniffles melonie! fnt tends to wipe folks out. I get exhausted just watching sometimes. that group is some of the funniest folks on the planet and you fit right in! plus it got you another sub from me and I am quite sure several others!
it was great to see you on fnt  look like you fit in perfectly and had a blast.  cant wait to see you on there again.  since you like fire emblem  there s a mobile game call fe heroes  in case you want to check it out.
great appearance on fnt last night! youre doing awesome stuff.
enjoy your content. its nice have someone with a fresh outlook in this format.
saw you on fnt and really liked your takes.  looking forward to following your channel.
okay  just the fact that you said youre a fire emblem fan too just made my day as well as many others Im sure. Ive been playing since gba days  sadly I haven t gotten to play all the old jp exclusive as well as new mystery of the emblem   how about you  also  for the ones you have played  which one is your favorite  my personal are fe path of radiance   radiant dawn not only for the only direct sequel Ive been able to play  but has the best story overall imo.
at this point  Im convinced that the people who are haters for anyone really love them. after all  hater is an anagram of  heart.   3
that blockbuster story is a lot like the angry grandpa bp story. if you haven t heard it just search for it. I was almost doubled over laughing. way back when I was in college back in the very early 90s I worked at a video store. it was to this day the most fun job Ive ever had. we did pranks every day and we had one wild collection of customers that came in there. I have some really funny and wild stories about that place.
I am here cause youre friends with the fnt and the quartering  and those guys usually know what s good. hello!
great video melonie! I was wondering you say the cats name a lot but I always seem to miss it  so can you put the record straight on your cats name
the friday night tights appearance was great! hope youre going back soon.  but with less poop stories lol
best wishes for much success melanie. boom goes the likes and views.
I grew up in a lutheran church  so we had a great work-around for halloween.  itshares a date with reformation day  celebrating when martin luther posted his grievances with the catholic church  the 95 theses.  we d have games and candy  with everyone in costumes.  basically the same stuff everyone else was doing  but under a different banner.
the haters hate because they cant see themselves in your place...speaking their minds  not fixating on istaphobery  being passionate about games or movies or characters or even kaiju  they are most likely unfit and probably not easy on the eyes - whatever  and they just dont know how to take the l.
so  mel. can we hear more about the carnivore burger   sounded amazing. pretty sure I need that in my life.
your dad needs to watch the series now  Ive read jjk0 not had chance to watch it yet
in regards to nick cage  his uncle is francis ford coppola. yes that francis ford coppola  the Godfather and apocalypse now . I think the thing is he does come from money. people who come from money - and didn t have to earn any themselves - are more likely to be bad with it. because they didn t learn what its like being poor or on a budget.
my favorite is makI  especially after what happend with zennin family I wont spoil because I dont know if youread manga .
@jelena jov  its on my list to read.  too much good content out there.  but I like her too.  she is pretty tough  since she has no cursed energy.
its a beef burger with beef buns and small slices of bacon as the lettuce  onions  and tomatoes  of course sliced to mock shape of said items  and the secret sauce is blood pudding.
was thinking the same thing. . . they know who his family is right   money wasn t really a question.  what s 50 mil when your next movie around the corner is 20 mil   its all relative  no different than me owing the irs 70k in back taxes  its just a smaller number to my smaller income.  just shock value when people see big numbers.  and thats just dollars  not family worth and assets etc.  he s fine.  like mc hammer once put in perspective  Im bankrupt  but am I poor or struggling like the everyday person I get to entertain at my shows who are living life   no  Im still doing quite well.
great to see you on fnt melonie
congratz on your no longer new channel.  hope you feel better soon  and that it came about from having a great time.  have a great weekend and God bless.
I used to buy the preplayed games from the blockbuster here. it was my whole reason for going! I got so many ps2 jrpgs and other gems that could probably give me a financial boost now if I decided to sell them  but I wont! thanks for that blast from the past.
I love how haters are just water off a duck s ass for you.  they have no power to subtract from your life.  they can only add to it.  their nonsense only makes your fans and friends so much more meaningful.  keep doing you  keep going boom
melonie mac  goin boom  right out of the mouths of haters. keep up the amazing work
I liked the first reboot lara game. it had a potential to be a good origin story. but she didn t really grow as a character to much and never evolved to be the lara we know from the originals.
even under the weather I love how cute you are!! love the videos!
thanks for answering. hope youre having a wonderful day!
a woman of culture
lara croft and the sisterhood of the traveling pants  a netflix production
you are an attractive person  and I dont mean just physically.  glad you turned up with the drinker and fnt.
a few picks the first two gba fire emblems are best  as well as the gamecube version.I recommend every shining force game. they were around since the early 90 s and we re the forerunner of fire emblem here in the us. the gba version has two additional characters and changes.I also recommend onimusha tactics  final fantasy tactics  psp . if n you can find them.also final fantasy iv for the gba  because it has the thing where you get yang  porom   palom  cid  and edward back.
the verse of the day was a good fit for me . I was feeling anxious about starting a new job tomorrow.
congratz on 30k  so strange that I just found your channel and then I see you on fnt.
you should become a regular on fnt
since you didn t win the shaker cup  the next best thing would be to make that logo into your own sticker  which you an also sell as merch to support the channel   and slap that on a blue shaker cup. bada bing  bada boom  almost as good as the real deal  and your audience can also get one too.
you should ve asked ryan on whether or not women in the 50 s and 60 s had it better or not.
melonie go boom   fnt  go yippee! --more please
to quote a funny man   jujutsu kaisen 0 in a nutshell  sasuke deku learns to control his stand
you were great on fnt...
I think you and eric july should collab as a guest on his stream or his on yours  gaming or otherwise  p
day 22 prt 2 of commenting on your videos until g-fuel sponsors me.it was so great for you to get on here. its my career goal to get my channel up there and based enough to hang with you guys. you fit right in and did great    hope they call you back and congrats on the 30k subs! I love fire emblem too. what s your favorite one
these days I would say its a honor to be cancelled on twitter
ousama ranking just finished and pretty sure its gonna have a 2nd season so please have a watch of it!
yo  do a break down on your tattoo s plz.  unless you already have and I didn t see it.  if its done a link would be cool.  keep making good content  and look forward to the next one.
joining fnt sadly comes with alot of hate as lots of people are jealous or salty about them. but nothing new for you I suppose lol ignore the haters
I remember getting a few free games I never returned from blockbuster  I totally stand with free video games.
I saw jujutsu kaisen 0 this past saturday and zero does take place before season 1 and is a prequel to the manga
other than hayley  felicity jones would have been a great lara and is not adverse to thatsort of film  and also jenna coleman for the similar physique though she prefers more serious roles.
thatsounds like lara croft meets scooby doo
hayley is a fantastic pick but thats as far as good choices will go there. we all all know the rest will be dumpsterfire good for nothing but making schadenfreude marshmallows. mmmm  marshmallows....
often people who grew up without money  are often careless when they get a lot of it quickly- such as influencers  lottery winners  athletes. a high percentage of them go broke.
I  3 fnt!!!
I bet melonie s haters are 12 years old and are not that many in number in comparison to all of us that like her! they are irrelevant.
when I said hayley atwell should play lara I was called sexist but yeah she s the closest you ll ever get
congrats on 30k! you should get tested for covid though.. even if it feels like a cold  it may be covid. that happened to me recently. I was 90  sure I had a cold  but when I got tested I found out it was covid 19. hope you feel better!
ah  the contest was over already. cool design still  and neat you won  250 for your effort.
Im jealous. jjk 0 isn t playing in cinemas in my country bawls
chilI s has some great meat dishes. smokehouse platters or something  all sorts of meat.
youre as obsessed with tomb raider as l am with metal gear solid and assassin s creed series
hayley atwell got curves
I already took a covid test before I went out to the theater and it was negative
@melonie mac go boom  good to hear! love the channel btw!
glad you survived
Ive been on this carnivore diet for a few weeks.  Im adding prunes and coffee though.  prunes are magical.  prunes man.
hImelonie I absolutely  seeing your camo tank top keep marching to your own beat of drum semper fI .are youstill doing your workout from what you learned from the marines  havegreat weekend takecare melonie
haylee at a well as lary croff  yeah. ye-yeah. lary croff from tom radder.
not sure you ve found out but square enix has revealed updated sales numbers for the  reboot  trilogy of games through the official tomb raider blog. you cantry to downplay the newer lara but these are incredible numbers.tr2013  14.5 millionrottr  11.8 millionsottr  8.9 million
is your dad jeremy from the quartering or gavin mcginness  lol
I used to work at blockbuster! I worked there for about 7 years.  d
so they are making scooby-doo with lara croft
30k! congrats!!!
congrats on 30k.
I knew that melonie was related to jay jay the jet plane
that comment was funny about finding you through your haters.
hayley atwell as lara croft would be netflix doesnt make her ugly   manly. like for e.g. in what if by m-she-u.
congrats with 30k!
outted your dad  outting  himself.boom
gratz melonie mac!
who s you favorite fire emblem unitso far
hayley atwell has the body for laura croft though
the biggest issue I have with celebs is wel some are largely fake and others talk about beeing nice helping others and eqality yet they have millinions nd never help out those in need and I think thats hypocricy.if I had millions all I need is  house  good gaming pc money to get me through  normal life nd the rest I would give to people that need it you see celebs with 24 cars and 8 houses nd m thinking why the f do you need all that crap while other people can barely make it each month.I wouldnt just give my money away because the people that need it might be irrisponsable with money but I would give some to those who need it everytime in the form they need it in help them where it works.I dont have all that much but I do give to people in the street if I think they wont waste it and I donate to channels that need it like honest you tube journalists and channels that give links to people that need donations for kids in trouble or woman who got out of an abussive relationship etc etc.I put money to my own needs but where I can I like to help out someone els to I wil never forget that one Bible quote  do unto others as you would have others do unto you
lara croft needs an upper class english voice... that is all!
I pooped my pants  we got to go home  guess you could say he went boom boom. I quit.
I never said they didn t sell well lol
still if you take inflation with it the og trilogy sold this much as well.
she never said it didn t sell well. she just doesnt like the direction they took laura in with the reboots. if you like the game  so what  why is it when people dont agree with someone  they feel like their opinion of a game or some other content is invalidated  what counts is  if you enjoy it  thats all thatshould count. peace!
@laracroftonline  inflation  what
blazing blade and three houses oh you said unit haha! sain
tomb raider sitcom   lol
Im sure your dad was thrilled you told everyone he pooped his pants at blockbuster.
your assuming schools teach money management
daddy waffle is happening  daddy waffle car video   its happening jeremy has real feet !

netflix is making a new tomb raider movie
how you doing today mama ! loving the camouflage gear!
both my favorites from the g fuel didnt get to the next round.... ...bs
yo soy  b.c. aka the new dark shadow  et cero miedo.
melonie did you like tomb raider legend
blockbuster is a nothing to me cause what we had was a movie gallery but they were pretty much the same thing anyway.
awake but not woke poopy pants
puppy!!! why are you so small!
garrett!!
I bet your dad wasn t happy about that
there a dog! !
boom!!!!!
if you like fire emblem you should try a game called triangle strategy
netflix reboots are just cosplaying with terrible writing.... its made me appreciate cosplayers more but ya thats all it is man
how was jjk
you think my dad would care  he has no shame  I am his daughter after all. why do you think I am the way I am  lol
@melonie mac go boom  ok  then keep the embarrassing family stories coming.  lol
gojira
@melonie mac go boom  ah  okay  the thickness of the syllables was throwing me off.
animated show. its gonna be terrible lol
bahaha he doesnt care  he s a goof too
triangle strategy is pretty good  I just wish it had perma deaths. that kinda kills it for me
I dont get why they make laura croft a barbie doll. she s suppose to be female indiana jones. so if she s kinda a cee you next thursday then so be it.
losers get  250  a neon sign and a fridge. no cup for you!!!
first comment to feed the algorithm .
hayley atwell is really attractive and curvy. at least she is at least a pick that exudes femininity......thatsaid...no she doesnt embody lara croft in my opinion. the show will suck because thats the standard nowadays.....but I guess we should be glad they didnt pick a black trans blind man with a club foot.everything is stupid.
blockbuster sucked. they refused to carry unrated movies. glad they burned.
sup doe
not trying to speak I ll of your mother. I feel if she had done more research into to history of halloween or all hallows eve she would have been more okay with it. considering some Christian holidays were built on top of pagan holidays.
first
I agree. my favorite hayley williams song is  the only exception .
hooray!!!
