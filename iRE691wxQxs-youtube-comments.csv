the whole g4 situation is truly sad. it really shows how woke entertainment stands for absolutely nothing. its all a facade in hopes of bringing in the views and money by pandering. becuase they dont actually believe this stuff. frosk might but I highly doubt the executives care about the message they re trying to sell. lol keep it up mel  this channel is needed
come on mel  you can win this. we belive in you
I feel sorry for the folks at g4 that are going to end up losing their jobs mainly because those egocentric staffers  looking at you  sessler  that had to ruin everything for everyone else. I hope gina  austin and the other good people land better jobs elsewhere.also  congrats on the top four  melonie! eryyyybaaaaaadayyyyy
congrats on the final four.  I remember watching tech tv before it was g4  and by the time it went off the air  itseemed that it had lost all of its roots.  everything that you could get on g4 is now on youtube.
I really like gas masks. I think they re cool. every veteran watching  has flashbacks of gas drills  j suit drills  and inventory boredomlolI enjoy your verse of the day  but love that you are well spoken when discussing your thoughts on the verse. its evident that you actually put God s word into action in your life.
congrats on getting so far in the contest! either  going boom  or the gas mask would work well for the shaker cup. another thing you could do is have the gas mask in front with an explosion  going boom  behind it  actually  you wearing the mask with an explosion behind it could be awesome.
melonie makes me smile    she would be perfect as a host on a proper reboot of g4.
you got this on the code madness. you nailed it with gamestop  and you ll do it again in this contest.  as for g4  it was great back in the day. even though I hadn t been into console gaming since the ps1  it was still interesting watching reviews and seeing where consoles were going. its just that laptops were becoming halfway decent for some of the retro gaming I like  as well as playing pc games like civ iiI and old dos games like wolfenstein or gabriel knight  sins of the fathers. plus  outside of mario paint  there hasn t been a console  as far as I know  with a product that allowed you to make your own music. opening up the pc world in  97 not only introduced me to a huge library of games  but the midI composition abilities allowed me to explore music more. so  between upgrading to a new laptop or getting a new console  the laptop wins out every time. for the Bible verses  youre right  it doesnt mean we ll get everything we want  but the daily bread we need  to get through the day and the opportunities that may come. some opportunities are good for us  but some are temptations that challenge us and our faith in God. after all  if we pray for God  as we do in the our father  to lead us not into temptation  but deliver us from evil  we cant be mad when God actually does that. well we can be mad  but its kind of futile.
blair  life is short and making memories with the ones you love is the most important thing in the world.translation  shocked pikachu face.
the problem is not just about frosk or that one guy or thatshe preloaded the rant and prejudiced or that we saw right through it and knew the real reason why she even brought it up  to shut down comments about her knowledge of the industry and her inability to handle any commentary well . the problem is also with the one guy who probably signed off on all of this  adam sessler. ever since the certain thing in 2014 - something we seem to not be able to say the name of anymore without drama - he s gotten extremely weird and has had several bad takes on twitter. and if you heard what he added right after frosk was done with her rant  you can see that adam probably proof reeded the copy she wanted to do and ordered it to be in there. he was  proud  of working with her  and those that didn t think he was could  go eat  something.  I bet you adam is 3 4ths of all of their problems  and I dont know how he would survive any of this.
congrats and good luck with the competition! been following wood from beatemups for years and have seen the mockup for his shaker which is blue and yellow and looks super damn clean! hope you both get into the finals
congratulations on hitting the top 4  melonie!
I d like to hear your thoughts on streamers like amouranth in a future video  its definitely not a cut and dry issue since there s also lots of issues like twitch moderation showing clear favoritism to certain streamers regarding tos  the issue of parasocial relationships and to what degree the streamer is responsible for encouraging them  etc. also any thoughts on the other people g4 brought on post-frosk
congrats on the gfuel madness you deserve in the top 4 God bless melonie
great takes  as usual  today. I really appreciated your observations exposition on the daily verse!
Im a huge fan of both you and friday night tights  and its cool yall are collaborating.  good stuff
melonie  glad I found your content via chrissie mayr.  your commentary on various topics and your willingness to share your faith make your content very appealing!  we all have our own ways of being ambassadors for Christ.have youread captivating by john and stacI eldredge  john eldredge wrote wild at heart    if not  I would highly recommend.  if you have  curious to know what you thought about it.
just so we know. it is indeed either the end or beginning of a major restructure  like from 59 employees to 6 people in an office space  once people start leaving like this. anybody that ever worked in a corporate environment especially a start up can confirm.
hey mel.  just wanted to say thanks for the g-fuel code.  never got this stuff before so Im wanting to see if it ll help with keeping me awake during rpg s.  also got the spider-man  no way home one in case you were wondering.
excellent vod  mel! put a melonie mac go boom logo on the shaker cup to piss of the wokies  honestly the gas mask would prob piss them off too though  lol ! frosk is a damn liar. no guys were being sexist towards her  she just classified her criticizers as sexist cause she could not take criticism about her knowledge of the industry and her inability to handle any commentary well. g4tv are hypocrites for allowing amouranth on. g4tv will most def be ending in 3 months tops  most likely between a month and 2 months. as for amouranth and other streamers that do what she does on twitch  that is very clearly against the rules because what they do is classified as softcore pron. ridiculous that they are allowed to get away with it. if a dude did what they did he would be perma banned  but because they are wahmen they dont get perma banned  they just get a 1 week ban  more like vacation  with pay  even a 1 week ban rarely happens  and then just go back to what they were doing before. they should be doing this on pron sites  not on twitch and twitch should be enforcing their rules equally  but of course they wont because they are simps.
exactly. they are all fake and crumble when put to the test in any way.  its pathetic really
@john dodo  yeah its quite annoying
it really is sad
they re in survival mode now.
@dying rose  I dont think they can handle thatsurvival difficulty from fallout 4 lol
@mystra  annoying would be an absolute understatement. plus  they couldn t even handle a halo 2 lobby! or 3  or 4...
everything woke touches turns to shit.
@mystra  agreed
its not like g4 shenanigans gave us nothing   we got chrissie mayr doing frosk.  that was fucking brilliant.
@red eagle  not everyone at g4 is a bad egg.
I wouldn t put austin in that wish list. he s a huge wokey too
dont you talk sh- naw jk  even back in the day sess didn t seem like a stable type. he seems like this anxious jittery type of nerd who gets tism angry. kinda like maddox  you think he s cool bc of his rants but its just him being unironically stupid driving the ragebus everyone was hopping on. ragers are characters and they re the types to be least taken seriously. g4 would have survived in pereira s hands
@androvsky  I d like to think in kevin s hands it wouldn t have been sooooo bad. maybe we d still have some wokey brokey type shit but not to this degree of pandering.
microsoft will own it by july.
almost to 30k mel... you are killing it!!
I knew in the back of my head that the g4 reboot wasn t gonna be like the original g4. I was still excited to see it back until frosk had to open her mouth with that rant.at that moment especially looking at the chat  it was over. I said  buckle up baby  the rollercoaster is about to drop.  when they posted that rant on their twitter and their playback.fast forward to today  the drop is still going.the drop is eternal.
I honestly didn t even know he was back too. the only way they can save the channel now is to bring back olivia and get rid of all those people that were cheering on that rant and frosk as well if course.  they might have a chance to get olivia as her career isn t exactly popping at the moment.
one of my favorite shows on g4 is where they talked or played games. one they had people compete in socom and I loved it. I didn t really like attack on the show very much  definitely wasn t my cup of tea.
I had no idea blair and jessica were together  after thinking about that for a sec  they re perfect for each other
good job in the tournament. pulling for you and baddie!! you should add something for tr in your tumbler design.
I personally welcome g4 s apology and look forward to more apology videos from them until their inevitable explosion. it ll be a great laugh and I love  sexy stuff  lol.
if you dont like it  dont watch it. peace!
there is a difference between looking good while talking about games and trying to be sexy to get attention and maybe mentioning games from time to time. I like this because it is the former. educated takes that are well expressed by an attractive lady. throwing in comments and good word of the day and this is one of the best shows of the day.
tomb raider talk starts at 15 30
it is about time someone gets that verse. very well said. if you follow the Lord  you ll want what he wants. you nailed it. keep it up  young lady.
congrats on moving up in the contest mel!!!the new g4 just doesnt do it for me... it doesnt hit like it used too  like back in the day...
I can see how discord would be like your digital house. you literally need an invite to enter  and if people are being nasty  they get kicked out. my house if for me  my family  and my friends  not the whole town. I feel similarly toward twitter too  which is like the garbage-filled back alleys with urine stained walls after drunken people stumble out and take a piss with their hot takes  just in front of the town square  not the square itself ...as I only ever use twitter while on the toilet.
ce to find out what was goin on with g4  and what g4 is. staying for the sermon. subscribing now.
@ 5 40 oh the hilarity! the flag flag next to team liquid is for the netherlands  not france.the tricolore  france s flag  has vertical bars.the flag of the netherlands has horizontal bars.
hope you win mel  this is proof that people really love you  apart from the woke doggies of course
when you said  sticking on theme  that is exactly it. gaming is can be an expensive hobby. if Im watching a video for a review of ghost wire but it just goes into some tangent like frosk did then Im dropping the channel. tell me about the gameplay  the good  the bad  and show it to me so I can make an informed decision on if I should buy it or not.
its strange how many people equate the amouranth guest spot with frosk s soapbox moment. they happened on two completely different shows. just like how olivia munn and morgan webb coexisted on g4 at the same time but brought very different vibes to their respective programs. I do believe restructuring has taken place but given the nature of the show that amouranth snippet was taken from  I highly doubt it was related
overhead in an executive meeting at g4 xplay  hey we need to recapture the magic of old-school g4 and get some eyeballs on our stuff  how about that amouranth  she s also on twitch and will come on if we pay her enough  but isn t her thing making sucking sounds in skimpy outfits  how will she be entertaining and what does she know about games   she looks great in a bikinI  but we just backed frosk on her rant about not objectifying women  nah  it ll be fine. we need some of those incel views  okay make it happen
g4tv reviewed games which is what about 50  of gaming channels do and they do a deeper insight than og g4to come back and start wylin on their fans there because of nostalgia g4 was just digging a grave for themselves
made our decision a helluva a lot easier.
I guess he didn t like it lol
@kidmoyer  lmao
blair herter january   if you dont hear the below unfollow me and dont watch us. we re not for you. blair herter march   goodbye g4 lmao
we are going to get you to  1 mel!
cole train ! also remember how fun g4 used to be 2005-2012
loving your  content great thoughts.
wow I just discovered you and now youre going to be on one of my fave shows friday night tights! its been a good day!
frosk insulted the entire gamer community in order to spread the  message . and what did it cost  killed the revival of a once beloved series  massive former fans unsubscribing to the channel  frosk becoming a laughing stock  xplay s channel getting no views on any of their videos  and a veteran member of the g4 team walking out and finding new and more profitable work.hope it was worth it  frosk.
2 of my favorite youtubers in the top 4.....you and beatemups.......lets go both
youre like the jessica chobot to my 9 year old s little melonie mac... she loves watching and likes the verses
congrats on the final 4. personally I dont care about g4 and they dont care about me. they dont want me as a fan. all this controversy was to turn the critiques about the poorly informed fake gamer girl by calling the fans misogynists. the reason I call frosk a fake is because she says it in her rant. she doesnt play games  she reads the scripts about other people s experiences with games.
considering your shirt  if you could own any one firearm  the freedom genie is offering you one wish  which would you pick
congrats on top 4 I figured you do a lara croft design but your own face body on the g fuel cup
problem with the g4 course correction is they still dont get it. most gamers aren t into amaranth and v-tubers. its in the same sphere but its not what people are looking for in a tv show. so to me itstill feels like they are pushing a narrative they want and not listening to the fans. I agree that if they had her do a segment on gaming or something it would have been better. I think sara underwood was respected on the show before. it wasn t her just being sexy for no reason.
there are memes made by other races that are funny as heck and may pertain to their culture but can sort of relate to us.  and they are fire.  Ive seen indian memes that are great.
congratulations on top 4!g4 is a dumpster fire thatsadly I dont think will be salvaged. you insulted your fans  frosk . told them you didnt need them  the dont watch comment . then you flip flopped by having amouranth after all the stuff frosk went on about.just end it all. you screwed up. accept it and learn
they definitely were pandering. you dont bring on amouranth and 4 of the biggest vtubers on twitch onto your show by accident. they want the coomers and the weebs. nyanners is the only vtuber I watch so I was very disappointed to see she was on g4. I hope she can make better decisions in the future
keep speaking the truth and God bless!!!
it was over before itstarted. the show worked fine on cable tv when cable tv was the only real option. watching g4 is like having a newspaper subscription now. hiring frosk  and the ham handed overcorrection  is simply an accelerant. big companies keep trying to do corporate tv media models in the internet space and seem to be clueless as to why it doesnt go well.
frosk is jealous of the previous hosts of classic g4
melonie you are the hottest most down to earth  pleasant and smartest  based woman on the internet and im trying to find someone just like you.  based women are few and far between unfortunately.  thnx for all your work!!!
there used to be this cool programme on sky uk back in my early adolescents called gamezville which put g4 to shame back early 00s.
aww
I think we need to make it absolutely clear that austin s show  the price show  is a. being hosted on his channel and restreamed on g4 for 90  less views  b. the show s production is g4 s but the show  set up  ideas  guests  segments  aesthetics  is austin s and c. he brought on amo with an extremely insanely high probability of having no prior incentive by g4. austin knows  twitch  clout otherwise he wouldn t be known for his infamous rajj royales and love or hosts. edit  I d like to add that he s soooo good at what he s doing as a streamer  that he streams  his own shows  like once a month or less. he s made it.the producers can literally see how many views he pulls during his shows and im sure they wouldn t raise a hand unless he s clearly violating cable tv land laws  so as long as the money is pouring in they have 0 reason to not have her around. g4 s morals are dependent on money  not yass kweening
she literally said  Im not as bangable  lol.
congrats on top 4!
at this point    greener pastures  would the front desk at walmart compared to g4
I have a grey tabby cat his name is max!!!
hey melonie I just want to tell you that this is sad thing to hear or read bout that entertainment is standing up for woke people and wanting this stuff to be real and get the company close for good so that people wont hear bout it anymore in future. anyway I just want to tell you that I think that its sad and wrong and that people need to move on and find something else to read and relying on when it comes to the entertainment news and other stuff like that  ok melonie. anyway also I know that this is from yesterday but I just want to make a comment about this topic from yesterday  ok melonie. anyway hope you have a wonderful and great blessed day today at gym and at home with your pets  ok melonie.
this show was aquired by g4  its not trying to be a show about gaming. I dont know why g4 would aquire a non-gaming show but its not really related to their other content. I noticed on the latest episode that I didnt see the g4 watermark.
I remember when g4 was on tv with comcast. it went downhill awhile ago when they merged with techtv. only good thing that came out of it was xplay with morgan webb and adam sessler  before he became cringe.
only person I feel sorry for is austin creed of the new day from wwe.the rest including frosk  I got two words for ya.
we sure hope so anyway.
we as humans were made to follow something. if we just go adrift  as Ive had to learn the hard way  we will follow something else. thats just who we are  like it or not. this is why Jesus said we are the fruit and he is the vine. remain in him and he will remain in you.
but that worked out so well for patrick soderlund and kelly sue deconnick.
I want a melonie mac shaker  I dont care what s on it. that being said  morgan webb  kevin pereira  adam sessler  chris hardwick  matt mira  alison haislip  etc. made g4tv what it is. blair herter always came across as an mtv vj that desperately tried to include bicycling into everything. how did that guy end up in charge
I used to watch g4 religiously back then but I wont touch it now. they alienated their entire original audience before frosk went full chernobyl  4. she just sort of pushed it over the cliff. not to mention sessler coming across as completely unhinged all the time. all they do now is scold and berate gamers for  sexism  and other  isms.  we basically gave them the finger and tuned out. now Im glad for them that morgan  candace  sara  and kristin didn t come back. they are far better off without participating in this garbage.
wanna bet he has some skeletons in his closet that will make frosk s stomach turn
I absolutely despise think of the children style arguments  but the twitch girls who find ways to show just enough skin to not be tos banned  the ones that have that convenient slip on a friday and get a weekend ban but somehow have more subs and followers when they come back  you cant convince me that they dont know exactly what they are doing and are taking advantage that the platform is seen as mostly for children to use  that amazon gives a free twitch sub  that amazon facilitates paying them directly with bits... I see it as there are websites for camgirls  and they should be there  or twitch should require you to be an adult to even step foot there. if you are exploiting an adult to give you money  fine  but its when its kids who this may be the only safe site they have to  spicy  content  and with the facilitating amazon does for money to stay in their ecosystem  it bothers me. again  you have no idea how much I hate this argument as its used against my hobbies and things I like  but what I like doesnt want kids part of it to begin with.
lets go! friday night tights!
Im sorry but that frosk chick just looks like a miserable thing. you dont want to be miserable  live a rewarding and fulfilling life. amazing how hard that is for some people.
I did watched x-play and g4 tv channel waaay back then after I immigrated here in the united states. I watched the shows because of the games they showcasing.I did not owned any gaming consoles nor gaming computer back then. Imight be on the minority of viewers  probably  but I was not even paying attention on who the hosts were or how they look like.so did herter got canned-like other executives gave him the option to either resign or get fired
yes  go boom!!
they should give amouranth his job  she is much smarter
us dudes love hot girls in gaming. you know  the vast vast majority of all gamers. any company pulls a frosk and tries to make our thing work burn em down. they wont get our cash.
youre right on about the God granting people their selfless desires  not their selfish desires. the first thing I read in the Bible was james  which promises if you genuinely ask for and seek wisdom  the God will grant liberally  1 5  and highlights the distinction between selfish wisdom and desires with the pure and gentle desires of divine wisdom  3 13-18 .if you just want money or power for your benefit  dont count on him laying down the carpet for you. even if you have good intentions overall  it doesnt mean you know best either  so still dont count on him serving you.the only things I really ever ask for anymore are wisdom  guidance  to be given his eyes and heart  and the courage and power to change the world for the better and to be a positive inspiration to others. those are the kinds of desires and requests he will readily grant.
pretty sure your channel is being suppressed. Ive been suubed for a quite a few months and always check your subbs. I can not believe thats natural growth. I dont play video games  read comics anymore  dont watch movies or tv  and I love watching. youre very entertaining. maybe if you grow your beard out like jeremy you d do better. give it a try  men and women are exactly the same  right
he got fired so hard that he had to move to another country.
I haven t been on your disc in about a week and a half but to barge into your disc and start yelling and arguing with people immediately is worthy of a ban. its peak hypocrisy to start a fight and then play the victim when there are consequences to breaking the rules.
congrats on gfuel bro!
melonie you got this competition in the bag I believe that you will win it
frosk lacks skill  attitude  personality  style  character  hygiene  discipline   experience
that cat has sum serious charisma!   oh ur great too mel.  now but teh cat back on!
it must be nice to be in gen x  you guys are never accused of anything! haha
red pilled 30-something s are probably the coolest because we remember what life used to be...... how it used to be before
g4 has always been doomed  they came back a decade too late. too many better options. why watch frosk  or anyone  read a review script for something they haven t played when you have guys like acg or yongyea doing legit reviews after a playthrough of course  I d rather watch amouranth lick lube off a hotdog than one of those guys.
the cat is pissed with this information  and he wants to share his opinions too
letttssss gooooooo boooommm!!!
I dont understand this idea of sexism in gaming. gamers tend to be nerds who would love if more women got into gaming. Im sure girl gamers get hate but is it any different than the hate male gamers receive  I feel like a lot people love to pull the race or in this case gender card to play victim but when people are coming after you for whatever reason rarely does it have anything to do with your race or gender or anything like that. frosk made disparaging comments about the playstation 5 which obviously angered some sony fans  she thought bioware was owned by microsoft clearly showing her lack of knowledge of the gaming industry  and she is very aggressive and combative in her responses to people on social media. its obvious why she got so much hate and while I dont condone hating on people for having different opinions  you cant call the ps5 a  dead man walking  then scream sexism when sony fans come after you.
was cool seeing youreact to my comment after 3 hours of subscribing in the next video lol
youre cheering on amouranth for doing what she wants to do  even though what she s doing is completely sinful   you cant follow Christ and condone sin  it doesnt work that way.  it diminishes your faith  and it diminishes your ability to minister to others when you say things like this.  one of the draws to your channel is that you do profess your Christian faith.  but that comment makes you out to either be a hypocrite  or a poser using the Christian faith as an angle.  I hope yourethink your position on this  because it honestly disappointed me to hear you say that.
so youre going to wear you mask and have a slogan like   get prepped boomers!
hes fleeing the sinking ship. lol
dude was probably paid to tank it for his new job as the competition
its almost as if telling your target audience that they are terrible  and not to watch  results in them not watching. weird...
this is a new channel  less than 2 months old
@melonie mac go boom  lol  I subbed when jeremy shouted you out on his channel  it feels like so long ago. man  time has been dragging. I still stand by the rest of my statement!
I dont totally agree. if g4 was a mix between the offlinetv and spawncast crews  it would have been very successful. it got a good amount of live twitch viewers early on and the personalities they gathered together already had audiences of their own.the problem was that the new g4 tried to be the old g4  but did it worse  rather than just transforming it into something modern.
@agent ooe its not your place to decide what s sinful.
the  boomers  name is hilarious!
did froskurinn drew those horrible tattoos on her unwashed skin with a pen   a marker
r.i.p. team liquid
congratulations.... ya gotta use the boom!
awesome video
definitely go boom
they dug their graves  now they must sleep in them
like s gas masks   sounds like a secret mauler fan....
bruh...  I need a link to that discord.
I would simp for you but in the words of kevin hart  the way my bank account is set up....
Im a thirty-seven-year-old boomer!!
wokism is directly proportional to brokism
g4tv fall down and go boom!
go boom definitely with the  and gronk4 is a trash  thing so long farewell gronk4 you wont be missed.  as for living well as long as Im financially stable Im great
g4 is long since dead. they needed to bring back techtv.
your cat is so cute
its a sad day that jessica married a beta
day 19 of commenting on your videos until g fuel sponsors me. yeah haha amouranth seems to certainly be an overcorrection on g4 s part hahahahahahhaaha
commenting to feed the algorithm
he s a dude named  blair ... enough said
back in the day  it was clear and objectively sound  what  sexism was  now its anything if you feel like it...
this guy is punching way above his pay grade. he wasn t even good enough for mtv road rules  not sure how he got any vp job lol
g4 should have never tried to come back.
finally the rotten fruits got removed .the rest of the crazy fruits will soon follow
facts
I was subbed to g4 and xplay from 2009 or so. didn t know they restarted it  didn t know who the frog was  its her name in norwegian   and immediately unsubbed upon the owen wilson on meth rant. I forgot I was still subbed to attack of the show too  until a notification popped for it last week. the notification was for the frogs video. I immediately unsubbed from that one too. I dont like... so I no watch.the faux nerd can go kick rocks.
subpar impersonation of whichever uso bro said this just dont go rated r like your boy xavier woods. well g4 only went like pg-13  back when that was possibly relevant
I just want a tv show or podcast with people who enjoy games without the woke crap. men or women  skin color  sexual orientation  none of that matters.
they didn t announce anything about him joining. he s garbage for saying dont  like dont watch then jumps ship.
you ever play ark se
I wish you d stop saying that this is a new channel
cool
I didn t grow up with g4 and due to their current activities I have absolutely no interest in viewing their content
hey  pretty sure that flag in the tweet is the flag from the netherlands  not france. I could be wrong but Im french and I dont remember our flag being horizontal
g4tv  I hope all the people involved in the collapse of that channel realize who s responsible for all this. snowflakes  its simple.
and I will continue to not watch him we made a deal
you said its not your cup of tea 4 times. so if I understand right  its not your cup of tea   p
another offensive shirt   lol jk imagine being as soft as those selective rule enforcing social media companies
g4 needs more hawt women frosk is a dude confirm lol
boom
what did you do to britney spears
yeah  dont remind me
milktoast take.  calling it  course correction  rather than blatant hypocrisy is some pr bullshitspeak.  too much euphemisms and kid gloves with these subjects.
too little too late for g4. Im not watching it. its a shame really. g4 was great back in the day. frosk took things to a dark and hateful place with her rant.
there s nothing more misogynistic than the woke movement.
more power to her  its borderline porn. if youre going to claim to be Christian then you need to stand for the truth.
morgan webb was fine.  olivia munn was a girl that you could have a beer with.
joe biden is the doofus  not you! lol
whoa  youre serious mel
I cant believe in any capacity you would try to say olivia munn was exploited!thats ridiculous. back then they would do skits along with verifiable information and it was fun.just because olivia munn leaned in to her genuine hotness.... so what  yeah  for the first time I think you kind of have a bad take here
netherlands not france... btw.. which it the real blair herter the white guy or not so white guy in the video
oh  just get to the point
lmao so true  and biden supporters too!
holland  wht do wierd people nowadays all think its called  nerherlands
@chris  it is the netherlands.. I have a dutch wife.. the kingdom of the netherlands includes the caribbean islands etc that they still control. either holland or the netherlands are both fine.
