we re living in an era thats averse to creativity and storytelling.
its a shame that we live in a world that hates creativity  storytelling and good writing for the sensibilities of people that have no connection to anything except their own narcissism.
you d think they would stop using phrases like  for a modern audience  and  modern sensibilities . they re the death knell to sales.
we re making this for a modern audience  is french for  we dont want your money
at this point  I just get giddy whenever I see a franchise get woke die off. its a universal law  at this point  that if you get woke  you go broke.
you know what would be nice  if there was a game franchise that made games for the fans from the beginning. if the  modern audiences  doesnt like that they dont have to play it or create your own.
honestly 1st fable was a masterpiece  I will never forget that game  demon doors  spells and storyline  everything was perfect
rip fable - another great game franchise killed by wokeism
the first fable has a special place in my heart   unfortunately it went the way of heroes  and by the time they stopped releasing games we were all glad it was over if they re trying to make another one thats actually good  they re off to a bad start here
a particular passion for this game.  that translates to  we have no idea what this series is about but we re going to ruin it anyway.  thanks..I was excited for this game but  now that melanie has told us what they re going to do with it  I ll keep my money and buy more  problematic  games and enjoy them knowing that they are the right games to buy.
Im actually playing this right now.  there could be some updates to the gameplay mechanic  and of course some graphics stuff  but the dialogue and story elements dont need any retractions.  if nothing expand on the awesome tone that it has.  I bet they ll change the romance system for sure.
from fable to feeble.
this is one of my favorite series  especially with jack of blades as a villain and if you know where to look  he has a monumental amount of lore. especially when the first hero had the hardest time with jack compared to the king and queen of blades from the void.
thank you for always keeping people up to date.I am going to go cry now.
og fable got me into gaming and 3d design back in the day  and the first one will always feel like home. the reboot was my only regret going with sony this generation. feeling a whole lot better with that choice now.
fans need to start getting into the gaming industry and take back the franchises.
working to 100  in fable 2 3 was some of the most fun times Ive ever had in video games. getting all the silver and gold keys  even finding all the gold eggs and ravenskeep books  so fun.
updated for modern audiences  is the kiss of death and let s me know I should skip it.
fable is what got me into video games! I was staying with friends and a bit bored at their flat. I go  Im not really a big video game guy   when my buddy suggested I try an xbox game. but  around 10 or 11pm  I dug around in the stack and thought  fable    this looks interesting..  next thing I knew  Im on the couch  absolutely enthralled  running around wooing the ladies with my trophies  when the couple Im staying with both get up for work
welp  there goes fable.rest in peace  brave heroes.
its not about lack of creativity  its about pushing wokeness. these more well known franchises and ips are easier to accelerate wokeness  because they have larger fan bases and appeal to more people  therefore the higher the chances for brainwashing more people  than smaller or new original ips.
@shadowman  smaller and newer ips are always how the best stuff starts anyways. less cooks in the kitchen I guess.
im playing God of war ragnarok
so true
@shadowman  that is why many japanese games that dont have the wokeness of western games are better.
the age of oppression. its very strange that barely anyone says that.
it does suck
yeah  catering to people who aren t gonna buy the fucking game anyways.
@danieru2d ch.  yeah just makes one wonder why cater for people that have no interest in the game at all instead of making it for the ones that will actually buy the damn game...no one will know but it will flop hard.
how on earth do you get that just from these quotes  thats really silly. this girls channel is all about profiting off outrage culture and looking for a video to make it looks like.
this is a great comment this!
get a switch. nintendo is basically the last bastion.
what  fable was woke even back then. you can be fat  skinny  gay  the whole game was about you can be whatever you wanted to be. the only thing I can see them add to the reboot  is the ability to make yourself a transgender character  but I dont have a problem with that as a choice  provided its an option rather than forced. if you wanna make a female tarzan have at it  as long as its not forced on me. rpg s should always have options  but as far as story  what story. fable is your typical adventure rpg game  but with some comedy and humor thrown in. only the first two had somewhat of a story  but only the original had a deeper story involving the sister. once you get past the prologue  it becomes like any other open world game. the original had fewer options  but you can still kinda be a stealth assassin  a rogue  you can be a complete a-hole to everybody. that was more possible in fable 2  but im gonna be honest  I never cared for the farting or burping either. I get they wanted to add some humor  but there s better ways they could ve went about it. that idea sounds like something a 5 year old might think of  thatstuff made sense in beavis and butthead  but its kinda hard to take a story serious knowing you can do that. I was hoping the trainer girl survived  but the only way to advance is by defeating her. now if your going for a evil run playthrough its all good  but your romance options in the main game is limited.
the truth and humor aren t popular among those in control but are popular among what is legitimately popular  so the modern narrative then makes them its enemy.
its not about the money  its about spreading a message. everything burns  - joker.
@jeymez  lol fable was never woke  they just allowed you do do anything you wanted to and be free to choose... not woke not forced etc ... you dont know what woke is apparently
@mark smith  what s sr 22
@beregond  saints row 2022
@mark smith  its a modern word  but yes I know what it is. its another word for feminenism. the feminist movement was about equality for gay rights and women  but that has not changed. gay rights got passed  but the word woke was applied to people who were overly sensitive. another way you can look at it is  female empowerment  and bashing masculinity.it was used as a word for the right to bash those ideas  that racism doesnt exist anymore  and that men are treated like a monster. but that word was created as a way to silence people  its the same way the left tries to use the race card. when people want to shut others out  they ll use a word to get them to shut up. now maybe I didn t explain it right the first time  what I originally meant was  fable already had feminist like stuff you can do in the game  with the exception of making a trans character. there s no way to alter your gender  your either female or male  but a gay romance is possible in the world of fable. id imagine the fable reboot or remake  adding a trans character option is something I can see them add. I dont have a problem with that  as long as I get to pick my choice. fable was all about choices  but the past games compared to bethesda s elder scrolls series  you were limited to all what you can do. but see I used the word forced for a reason  because that is how some people feel about feminist stuff in games.
@jeymez  they aren t talking about choice  they are talking about not offending anyone and pushing the left and lgbtq over all else ... xbox leadership is very very woke and liberal
@mark smith  and your point is  corporations are by and large liberal. hollywood is the same way  so why would xbox phil spencer or playstation be any different. a business is never gonna turn away those people  because at the end of the day they wanna make money.but its not about pushing lgbtp over all  its about creating an even playing field.if you can still play the game how you wanna play it  why you worried about what else might be in it.we say were all about fairness and equal opportunity  but only when it benefits you. so if that means they gotta force thatstuff into the game  so be it. they didn t say anything about your forced to play this character the way we want fable is still gonna be a rpg or some kind of open world game  so until we know all you can do in the game  right now we dont anything about fable. people were hoping for a fable game awhile ago  but the original team lionhead sold it to microsoft.and then they made some kinda online fable game  but that ain t what people wanted. they wanted that feel from fable 1 and fable 2 to return  but now somebody is doing a reboot.
@jeymez  there is no such thing as equality and fairness  as you can see in the last 10  years  if one group is prioritized hyper focused over another  it isn t really fair  is it
@autisticus maximus  well in a game called dragon age inquisition  they created two characters for a same sex relationship  the guy with the mustash and sara the elf girl. but those were optional romances  so youre not forced  but you cant get with either one as the opposite sex.
the only story telling the people who own and control all content production like to do is about the  fabled  six million
@frank van der merwe  you mean God of woke
@andrea mitchell  yea sure
@shadowman  the only game that didn t have some leftist agenda to it was the original. fable 2 the plot was a critique on gentrification. if people remember the main antagonist  intends to use the music box to wish all the poor people off the face of albion even though its over simplistic  doing this outside the confines of a videogame would collapse civilization . fable 3 is a critique on feudalism and capitalist society as it emerged out of the aristocracy so with exception to the original which has no agenda the entire series could be labeled socialist leftist.
@shadowman  define wokeness.
@heroes united media  resorting to strawmans and untrue claims  and literally everything you said was untrue  especially about me  means you lost here. when people say leftists are ignorant and out of touch with reality  I ll think back to your comment.
@shadowman  define a strawman fallacy and how I used it
they live in an isolation chamber where all of reality is avoided
gow ragnarok got away with it. even I bought it and I complain about wokeness all the time. youre right that for lesser franchises it can be a kiss of death.
yup. thats basically telling lots of people  the ones who actually spend time and money on the products  not to buy the product
@izzy arland  woah woah. there s woke shit in that too   I ll be avoiding that like the plague then.
tbh I prefer if they say  modern audience  in their advertising instead of lying to me and stealing my money. this way they wont see a cent from me.
well  they used to just say  its not for you  and people wouldn t buy their games  this is just a sneakier way of saying that.
I rather have them tell us from the start that they are planning to do that  since itsaves us money.
@izzy arland  how is gow woke
@joe hockey player  it wasn t woke  but one of the makers said something along the lines of updating the series for a modern audience.  but for them updating it was making the gameplay closer to modern games then the original series and making the games more narratively driven.  not what is usually meant when you hear that from other developers.
needed a good laugh  thank you kind stranger.
@ landon mathewsyup and with gp being xbox primary way to make money its way easier for them to absorb any losses..
@native21rogue  any time
hebrew actually
in latin it means  we want your money but we are sabotaging our chances of ever getting it.
@dalia  I came to post this
cursed words
it just illustrates the delusional world that they live in. they really believe that they can cater to a tiny fraction of the gamer demographic and still be a hit. expecially when catering to that tiny audience necessarily means insulting and denigrating the vast majority. they simply dont live in reality.
@joe hockey player  that game been woke since they took out sex scenes and women nudes.
angrboda being race swapped to fill a quota.
and thanks for asking!
they have to push their ideology no matter what. this  updated for modern sensibilities  trend is straight up herbert marcuse s  the new sensibility  he wrote about. the marxism so obvious and easy to trace to anyone with knowledge of these people  and the origins of woke.
@bigman101111111  be a bit weird to have sex scenes in the new gow  also sex scenes in video games are weird anyway.
@izzy arland  although race swaps are annoying her appearance in norse mythology is vague as she wasn t declared as a redhead until the modern take on her.
@fight ostin fight  even the  quartering owned himself when he tried to play the get woke go broke argument with gow because you ll then have to keep thatsame energy for the 6th-7th gen gow games.
they act as if its a medieval thing rebooted 500 years later...
@rambleon07  I think youre talking about yourself buddy
@izzy arland  they put woke shit in gow   didn t play it yet
@b g  so the original meaning before it was tarnished by all these brainlet devs
@joe hockey player  thor is having a gut instead of being like kratos angrboda is black in a norse mytho and so on there are few things but gow is still solid cause the story was crafted first then rest of things were ether changed or introduced later or at the same time. so yea story is well made. dont get me wrong but when you do blackwashing its just a lame way to make a character. you whant to make a black character be creative and build it. miles morales is a good example he has amazing personality and his character is well made and while im not a fan of taking any character and copy paste him and I dislike the spider-man idea of him the personality of miles keeps me interested. so yea
I d argue you could make a woke game story that is appealing to the majority of the audience  but that would require clever writing and subtlety. traits that many producers sadly lack nowadays.
woke isn t real
@lex ruptor  remember that one cowboy bebop episode where spike travels to a planet where criminals are exiled to  and there he meets a trans woman who used to be a guinea pig for science experiments  I think that is a good example of woke done right.
Im kinda with you. Ive pretty much noped out of modern western media save a few outliers here and there. the only thing I ask is that they go so far that it becomes parody or hilarious for how bad and nonsensical it is. I love the so bad its funny modern media. great fun to make fun of or meme on.
@legend of fupa Im a firm believer that you can do any story as long as you dont scrimp on the world building or character writing. the issue I have with a lot of modern western media  and what I refer to as  woke   is that they usually dont put any effort into their characters or their worlds. it feels like they just slap on an identity and want to show  x  identity being the best. I think they re more focused on that image rather than creating a character for the audience to sympathize with and root for. for example  galadriel in rop is completely op. she never has any real struggles and is never proven wrong. she s so powerful thatshe tanks a pyroclastic cloud from a nearby volcanic eruption to the face and all she suffers is a light coating of chester cheeto s spicy hot cheeto dust. sure we get to see a powerful female character but power only means something if you care about the character and understand the limits of said power. with galadriel itseems like she has no limits.its been awhile since Ive seen that bebop episode but I do remember enjoying it and being interested in the character s backstory and the stuff they had gone through. made me able to sympathize and relate with them. we need more of that.
@legend of fupa  I think you confusing politics done right with woke garbage  women  black people  gay characters and trans characters in entertainment are not necessarily bad thing if done right  when its done wrong is when it becomes woke.
yea. the house of the dragon and rings of power really suffered both targeted as woke . no one has gone broke from your imaginary  woke  nonsense.  saints row failed because it was the 2010s mechanically and design wise.
I dont know  I heard house of the dragon is actually good.
@legend of fupa  false because once it was figured out. we would all chastise and  ridicule it. and either not buy it. or stop playing it.  so sorry. nice try.
sounds like eldan ring
they try  see kingdom come for example. however gaming journalists are burying them
@frank freemanthe  modern audiences  they talk about dont buy the games anyway.  they are stuck on tik tok and twitter constantly looking for something to complain about that they have no involvement with anyway.
the  modern audience  aren t buying them or watching them. they just complain if they find out there isn t any in it. does not matter what it is.
@atreas40000  we need to stop giving traffic  attention and credence to those  journalist
we had that though frank after 2013 games just became meh
@legend of fupa  agreed but thats the old school definition of woke. woke in 2022 means an entirely different thing. in a reboot the trans would groom children and call spike a phobe when he tells the trans to stop.
@equivalent exchange is a lie  I get what you mean  and its a fair argument. sad to think we arrived at this point in time.
@marshinz   house of the dragon wasn t supposed to be woke  unless woke now includes rampant incest. rings of power was so bad that they re talking about completely retconning it for season 2. many titles have gone broke because of the  woke nonsense  despite your imagination wishing otherwise.
yea but I hate seeing it happen to things I used to like. fable being one of them
@lex ruptor  it most definitely is
@legend of fupa  possibly  but it would have to be something brand new from scratch  not rewriting something that already exits.  why cant they come up with something new
tell that to black panther!
@legend of fupa  I think a better example would be the shit netflix resident evil series
what does woke mean to you my friend
@molasor rosalom  its actually really good  dont let the opinions of others impair your ability to find entertainment. there isn t even anything  woke  about it  people just say it is for the sake of views. its a really well written show.
even with all of the things that they cut out and the bugs and that the game was still a joy to play and had so much replayability. Im contemplating hooking my old xbox up and going through the main story again.
first game I played on original xbox  I just remembered feeling like it was going to be a simple friendly game until I saw that first guy taken down by an arrow in the back and a sword through the abdomen for good measure.... ahhh those were the days.
thats the game that got me more into real gaming and away from madden.
@derp nader  I did.
fable the lost chapters was awesome thats for sure
I just popped in ffx and its so much better than ff7 remake and ff15  I think all the best games have already been made and nothing will surpass the older games modern games suck tbh
it was the best  I dont believe any fable could ever top it.
I am curious they are paid to ruin everything that we love  even when they lose money  or they just stupid ...
the games not even out is there a reason to be concerned yes but the game doesnt even have anything to judge but words and a cgI trailer
working as intended.  the purpose is to destroy anything that might drive positive creativity and influence.
@cloudspottv  I think as this point we can pretty much say they re paid to. this has been going on too long  the statute of limitations is up on them  learning the lesson   this is intentional. its too obvious.
@crossdaboss8  saint s row is a good example to be concerned. I genuinely want the game to be good but sensitivity is  just anther word for convenient censorship.
was it great  though  fable 1 was good for its time  and thats it. the series is pretty bleh.
didn t the first trailer have a frog that was eating a fairy  that doesnt look like its gonna be dumbed down or anything. what was said here that its gonna be  woke
leave it to conservatives to cry omg
@deaven  have you decided your pronouns yet
nothing good will come of this  you and I both know that.  the myth of the  modern audience  rears its twisted and ugly head once again.  I also love the first fable game.  it was one of the first xbox games I ever played.  it makes no sense to disregard the huge established fanbase that will literally throw money at you if this was made well  for a hypothetical audience that  even if they do exist  are unlikely to give you any actual money.  they may post on social media about  progress  and  representation  but that isn t going to turn into actual cash.    when you sow your seeds among weeds  even what manages to grow will have the life choked out of it.
wrong its not good they re making another one at all.
@tutu adefolalu  the game industry has go insane  with trying to convince governments they should be a protected art form   since the first mortal kombat game came out and doused every one with its blood. going  woke is just an extension of that . and it does mean more to them  the game industry  than the sales of 1  2  3  4  5 or hell even 10 games.  they will keep doing this till video games have higher legal protection than films do.
@theskyiz blue2day
how does that translate to that  if youre turned off by such little quotes without even seeing anything thats weird. an outrage channel looking for a quick video this looks like and youre lapping it up.
its like creativity has just died completely. and now they just want to ruin existing franchises
having a good time with granny at the fun house sure was something else. xd
I remember in the original game  there was this one chick in oakvale that loved my evil dude  for no known reason  even though everyone else ran  he was also poor at the time.  so my guy married her  and she was always so good to him  even when he d do his evil laugh and kill people. I dont know if she was supposed to be that blind to his reputation or if she was just broken  but I love that little story.if its going  woke   I cant imagine there s even a little bit of hope for a similar experience.
hate to break it to you but the story is getting reworked. I doubt the combat will be good either. the people making games dont even like video games. you cantell by how shitty they are becoming.
@mona mia  honestly thatsounds amazing
wait...I thought the up-and-coming fable was a reboot  not a remake. starting from complete scratch  not supposed to be original fable...pretty sure this is going to be an all new game  ignoring the canon and events of the original trilogy entirely.
@pyre  and its gonna be complete fucking arse!
@chibychibs  elder scrolls isn t going anywhere
@chibychibs  what you even on about  what you even judging this off  a channel that thrives on controversial videos
this should be the pinned comment
or fable to gayble
@dlc energy  definitely not
lol people judging off quotes  the first trailer had a frog eating a fairy. that doesnt seem like its going soft or anything like people are trying to make out. youre being suckered in by an outrage channel here I think.
@j gooner894  hey I hope so but the people that made the trailer might not have had much to do with the actual game. I dont think a trailer and a few quotes are enough to judge wether or not it will be good  bad  like the originals or completely different. only time will tell. either way it ll fun to see
me too. I cant believe they will go woke with fable. how can a studio be so delusional to think this is necessary  I played fable to get lost in the world  not be reminded of real life.
wait I thought it was the knight and queen of blades.also Im fairly certain his hardest fought battle was against the queen and he only won after stealing the sword of aeons from jack of blades.after that he completely destroyed the knight and pretty effortlessly beat jack  although jack put his soul in his mask to survive.as for the queen there is one piece of evidence thatsuggests she might have actually survived to. that being a little girl in lost chapters who will sometimes say the line  I am the bladed queen  or something like that.been a while but Im pretty sure Im remembering that right.
@enuma elish  oh that is right it was knight not king of blades  I totally forgot it was the knight of blades that got bodied  but then the queen of blades definitely took longer take down  but it was jack that took the longest to kill  especially when he put is soul into the iconic mask that killer instinct has as a reference on jack with some of the costume bits for mira.you mostly had it right  except the length of time between jack and the queen of blades was flipped. if that were the case  we d see queen of blades in the arena part before you fight whisper not jack.
@nightshade helis     to be fair this is a different studio making this game.
@m3tr01d86  well yes and no. we see jack in the arena because he put his soul into his mask. Im fairly certain the lore states that the first hero  william black if I remember correctly  used the sword of aeons and broke his body in a relatively short amount of time but he fought with the queen for several days I believe. in the end he wonthe knight was confirmed dead  jack survived in his mask until someone eventually picked it up becoming jack of blades we met fable where he is searching for the sword of aeons  and the queen is presumed to have been killed but again there is that interesting bit of dialog hat suggest she might not be.actually I just looked it up his battle with jack is described as them  firecely striking at each other until eventually william destroyed jacks body forcing his soul to hide in the his maskhis battle with the queen however is described as  the queen of blades was the last to face william. for weeks their battle raged across albion. mountains were raised and valleys were formed by their mighty blows. at last  william slew the queen and freed the people from their torment. but yes from what is confirmed jack survived the longest because of his crafty nature but not because of raw power. in terms of raw power the queen far exceeded jack as it was said william almost lost to her even with the sword of aeons. and it was his battle with her that actually ended up having william in the void for so long that it infected him and forced him to go back and expell the corruption along with a huge amount of his power which would later become the corruptor.
@enuma elish   thanks for correcting me because its been a very long time since Ive touched fable lore. do you mind if I can keep a copy of your comment so I can keep some notes on hand
@m3tr01d86  go ahead
@enuma elish   thanks man
fable tlc was the best. the series got progressively worse after. very disappointed to hear fable  4 I assume  not watched the video yet  is going woke.
@jack  fable 2 was better personally.
that game had the best money glitch  plus if you went evil you looked like a devil with a pestistilence  cloud.
in the new fable you cant choose to be good or evil. only an activist.but hey at least you can have surgery on your junk ingame!!!!!!!
you say that but sony and microsoft are both woke
@ryan   oh  I know. but Ive always loved the fact thatsony had a much more international catalogue of games.
@charles kieft  sorry  I have to disagree. the villain in tlc was 10x better. I didn t like the introduction of firearms in 2. they made the evil faction a joke in fable 2 and 3  etc. fable 2 was just okay imo.
@charles kieft  not better than the first  but there was more to do in it. plus I preferred started out as an orphan with your sister  not that the first was that much different  but nothing really bad happens to you. your sister dies and your the only one to survive that village  but in fable 2 you technically died after being shot out of a castle window. but considering what we know from fable 1 she s no ordinary person. still only the first 3 hours of so was the strength of fable 2  but fable 1 storywise was heavy from start to finish. the extra humor was added so the game didn t feel so claustrophobic and depressing. by the time you get revenge on the king the one who shot our sister and character  I didn t feel this sense of relief  it was more like thats it. in fable 1 you start playing  and its hard to put it down. but fable 2 is still a good game  fable 3 is where the series fell off the cliff. now granted I did like how they finally added some voice acting for our hero  but thats not enough to make up for the lack of story. I didn t care about being a prince or if you played the princess  I didn t care about restoring the kingdom  because thats kinda what you do in the previous game. now if you make it an option similar to fable 2 and fable 1 where you can become someone important  that would go over better  but if your forcing that to be what you have to complete  it doesnt leave much satisfaction. now one thing I did about it was  because you were a person of noble status  I did like getting people on your side  but just like in life I hate politics. I would not want to be the person to make decisions to effect the lives of others  because you can never make everyone happy. its the same with republicans and democrats  not everyone is gonna like you. if you want to make me a leader  make me a head soldier or someone that can inspire others. but politics will always divide people.
@charles kieft  I have to disagree. fable 2 worsened the balance issues between play styles  removed the armor system instead of improved it  essentially making it into nothing but a fashion aspect  and the bosses were far more disappointing. story just wasnt as good either.it was still a fine game but imo it didnt live up to the first  and certainly didnt improve on it.
they get kicked out like henry. the infection on the gaming industry has spread too far unfortunately. the best thing we can do is vote with our wallets
dont forget the taunting gargoyles!
did you ever get the smart glass app to work for that one achievement on fable anniversary
fable 3 is utter trash
well done lad  all the beetles are dead
the gaming movie industry is creatively bankrupted.  I felt that.
rip fable  you will always be missed.
my favorite thing in fable 2 was marrying a prostitute  taking her to my wagon bed  roughly the size of a twin bed  and telling 3 female prostitutes and 1 male prostitute to follow me  I believe I was a female hero. so in short 4 active prostitutes  1 former or active married prostitute  and a lady hero. somehow piling into a twin sized bed with no real privacy...the best part was my wife would run away screaming  but since she loved me and was told to follow me  she would round a corner  coming walking back  and would see my...  entourage  and would run away screaming  round a corner and come walking back... I let this go on for about 5 minutes.
Im getting very close to just being done with video games all together.
I need handicapped south asian goblin representation in my fantasy video games
Im not even a gamer  but this makes me want to play the original fable. either 1 or 2. cant remember but my guy was so beyond evil. it was hilarious. I couldn t even do missions because people run or the guards would immediately try to kill me. death and destruction to all. all races  creeds  sexes. pure chaos!
making something for a  modern audience  is extremely vague and can mean anything when it comes to gaming in general  as it could be referencing gameplay mechanics or interconnectivity between players  just to name a few examples . if they are referring to racial stuff like having  poc  characters as a part of the narrative  then they are clearly not aware of fable s rich history  which has been diverse in its cast from the very beginning.
itseems the gaming world is not immune to the  new identity  of the entertainment industry. what ever happened to telling a good story stay safe. take care. have fun.
Ive still got the anniversary edition and my own mods. fable lives on in my heart.
youre so right on that mel! modern take   woke wash treatment! its sad to see what we love and treasure take this route.
their is only one reason they did this they think everyone has completely forgotten about fablein reality its only them
it is quite obvious they do not have a love for the franchise cause if they did they wouldn t attempt to destroy it by going woke.
we re tired of companys wokafying our favorite games. melonie  is there any vidoe games youre excited about thats coming up  great video. always great to see. you look beautiful. take care melonie.
keep up the great work  love your channel! need more like you calling out how bat crap crazy the whole industry has become.
playground has a  do more with less  mentality oh.  so we should expect she-hulk levels of graphics   outstanding.great video melonie!  as usual.Im left to wonder why I haven t bought any new games in a decade or so.  oh  no  I remember why.  handing off storied franchises to sup-par development who will do bad work on the cheap so they can get more profit from the high prices.  and now on the rare occasions I want to play one of the series I love  I just go play the old version because I know I ll enjoy it again.
disappointed to hear fable is going the wayof the  agenda  side bar  thought it was the cutest thing when you posted that pic of you and your pop for Godzilla day   we sometimes cantake our parents for granted with how busy life can be.  but trust me  when you loose one unexpectedly  perspective hits you like a ton of bricks..you seem like a genuinely good person. still not sure how the algorithm recommended your channel. but Im glad it did! ! 110 ilbs of sas mixed with excellent humor  and well informed articulated opinions. plus your tiny frame and voice makes it even better for some reason!!
thats sad to hear I was looking forward to the new fable. one of my favorite thing to do in fable 2 to eat super unhealthy to heal and make her super fat and then eat really healthy to heal and make her super skinny and go back and forth. with all the body positivity stuff now a days they will probably get ride of that.
Ive been playing games since the original nintendo was born  and have lived enough to see how bad the video game industry is today. pains me to see fable fall like this. it was one of my favorite action adventure games. rip fable.
y know what I find truly sad  of all companies  capcom has proven that you can update old games stories and characters for  modern sensibilities  and not f    them up. I liked jill valentine long before the re3make  and while that game is far from perfect  they did an excellent job portraying her. she s attractive  witty  confident  kicks a lot of ass  but at the same time she s not without her weaknesses. and unlike most modern entertainment  they didn t feel the need to dumb down carlos just to prop her up. carlos is actually given a lot more to do and is a far better character than the original. at least imo.plus  her final line  next time  take the f   ing hint  to nemesis might be the only girl boss line I didn t cringe at. because it was earned.
this is terrible! fable was my jam back in the day. this woke culture bs is destroying everything it touches and Im frigging sick of it. keep preaching  mac! go boooom!!!
ah a true evil man of culture.
the same thing happened to me  but in real life.
thats peak fable
nah  no need for that. you can be retro. and once in a while we do get a really good game still..
I couldn t ever get rid of video games. my favorite hobby. tv and movies though  threw them out years ago
God of war ragnarok  have you played it its amazing
so be doneim kidding
@d1v1d33  it used to be my favorite hobby too. back when gaming was pure and fun for the sake of gaming. now its filled with either some sort of agenda or politics  or fucking annoying battle passes and microtransactions  or they are just unoriginal.almost feels like people need some extra shit from the game to keep playing.. like what ever bullshit you get from battle pass and grind on and on. back in the day when didnt have those and we played because playing was fun.
@v his64  truth
uhh  bye
yeah no. it means something very specific  as has been shown time and time again.
they didn t say for modern audiences    they said for  modern sensibilities    pretty direct and specific.  thatspecfically means it ll be woke.
@denver starkey  its just a word and some do you are way too sensitive. the first trailer had a fairy being eaten by a frog  I doubt its gonna be a complete shift from the other games in terms of tone.
the original games were pro lgbt and antI capitalist. why people ate acting like it wasn t is beyond me.
@khazandar  any examples
@black bat  rings of power  the new warriors debacle from marvel  mcu phase 4  ghostbusters 2016  wheel of time  the live action adaptation of mulan  so on and so on.
isn t there too much of that now on the internet  people hopping on this outrage culture and thats all their channel is  there s way too much of this  antI woke  culture on the internet especially where thats all their content is as it looks like disingenuous to make some money. a whole video over a few words that could mean anything  its ridiculous.
isn t there too much of that right now in media and entertainment  people hopping on woke culture and pretending they actually care to make money off of certain demographics  there s way too much  woke  culture in the gaming and movie industry and when thats all their games or shows are about it looks disingenuous to make some money. crapping all over existing lore of franchises to make sure the message is seen and heard by all  its ridiculous.
@aaron cobb  usually when it comes to these channels its as little as media including different kinds of people and then these numpties on the internet moan about it being woke even though it had no effect on the actual quality of the product  thats how shallow it is. even if a product is being disingenuous its ambiguous and up to interpretation while these channels its up in your face and obvious. whole channels made up of calling out supposed products or whatever it is for being woke. good and genuine people I dont think have whole channels based around negative assumptions. how come there isn t good stories  ask that question.
Im looking forward to obsdians skyrim type game then maybe them making a fallout game again in the future like they want
thank you for your daily boldness and courage for speaking out against these things  melonie! be of good courage  and he shall strengthen your heart  all ye that hope in the Lord.  psalm 31 24
I loved the first 2 fables.  I really considered getting a series x for the newest fable.  but I ll be sticking with my ps5 for the foreseeable future.
the fable games were also known to have some of the best crude humor of any video game at that time. I hated that fable 3 took a more serious turn then the other two but there was still some crude humor in there. you cant have crude humor and not be offensive.
wow  this is sad. I watch other gaming news channels  mrmattyplays  yongyeah  legacykillahd  etc  and I havent seen any of this info. they are good channels that report truthfully  but they know thatsmashing out this info would just upset gamers. this was an amazing franchise  and I have been looking forward to this game for so long.
hImelanie  love the show! Im with you  I dont like the  woke wash  on anything  either especially my games!! keep telling it like it is!
first game was so good  story music and gameplay felt like you were little british kid growing up in medieval times
recently watched a youtube video explaining that it was these foundations that offer grants for inclusivity. this was actually the force behind push for all this in media but because the heavily foundations belong to a certain people we cant talk about
oh man Im really wanting to get into the fable franchise Ive never played any of the games but they looks so cool. this new game wont be where I start if its getting woke washed.
melonie  are there any studios in game development or movie tv studios that do not cater to wokism  I keep waiting to hear a boom of independent studios or mainstream  that just want to make great content.
I still regularly come back to fable the lost chapters because it is by far my favorite game. I was so hyped when I saw the teaser a few years back and now learning they are doing the qhole go woke go broke thing upsets me to my core.
r.i.p fable.you will be missed.
2 25 I dont think that is a  worst  news because back in march  or february or somewhere on that  the initiative have been management problems in 2021 with so many devs are leaving the studio so they wanted a help which is crystal dynamics and the head of the initiative is the developer from crystal dynamics so they choose crystal dynamics to help for the game development2 33 but hey they are not part square enix anymore  which you should blame them  not crystal dynamics   they are now part of embracer group since september
great vod  mel! I was looking forward to the fable reboot  but now I dont even want it. Im very disappointed. Im sick and tired of wokeness infesting the things that we love.
dang. I was so excited for this. I guess I will have to wait for the reviews for this one than getting it on day one and Imight not get it at all if I see it catering to wokeness.
man  I loved fable  the lost chapters  you had so much fun even after ending the game. Ive played for so long that I knew how to open every door  how to cheese silver keys  and even killed everyone in order to buy properties from them. and all that thanks to the beatiful story and mechanics that allowed me to play in so many ways and for so long. fuck woke games
the phrase -  go on  smash his barrels  will always make me smile.
I think there are examples of devs who weren t known for a certain type  or quality  of game that hit it out of the park in a new genre. guerilla games  horizon   double helix  killer instinct season 1   just to name a couple.  I ll wait for the first gameplay before Imake a judgement.
melonie   I need all your tank tops. clerk   but ma am  this is a baby gap. melonie  grabs clerk by the neck  all your tank tops!
literally the only thing that made me excited for this new fable game was that itseemed to be back to medievalall I wanted was a fable with modern graphics  not realistic  cartoon fable is the best  and with better variety in gameplay  like in elden ring where there is basically infinite builds  just that  you dont to rediscover fire to make a good fable game  another franchise with fate completely destroyed
that really sucks.... I was genuinely excited when I saw the announce teaser.
thank you so much for the encouragement
@melonie mac go boom  always here to support you and be a friend
it was made by brits with britosh humour in mind modern sensabolities whoch is inherently american based  will kill the series big time
fable 2 was better and 3 was my favorite
I d say id software is probably one of the last ones.
you think its gonna go soft or something  the first trailer had a fairy being eaten by a frog.
@j gooner894  it will subvert tons of things deemed to be offensive insensitive. certainly you wont be able to cheat with black dudes love of interest  beat him and humiliate him. you also probably wont be cruel towards animals  cause thats no right or some shit. offensive animations that character would will be deleted and replaced by the cringe ones. you wont see negative female characters. you wont be able to beat the shit out of your co-female student that tried to be a hero just like you  but you were the chosen one. and some men in high positions of power will be incompetent. thats my bingo card. oh  and the game will be broken as fuck  because for some reason woke activists cant make games work fine on release.
@j gooner894  no one gives a fuck about frog eating a fairy  trailer is a trailer  its made to convince you to buy a product and its been time and time again proven that you cant trust triple a game companies with product on release.
@serking  a lot of pre conceived bullshit thatsounds like  thats what you get from just some pr comments  sounds like youre just looking for these things. the last fables didn t exactly have all that.
as a gamer of 30 plus years  melanie perfectly encapsulates why I am so unenthusiastic about the future of video games. the vast majority of games that I play are the 7 years old  and if they are not  they come from an independent studio that has not been gutted by all of this garbage
in regards to this modern sensibilities  wokeness  they will try and thrust upon us. maybe we should be getting in touch directly with the playground games studio and voice our concerns. tell them we aren t interested in woke content  and that if they continue to follow this path  they may aswell canthe project altogether and forget about it.
I loved how crazy and adult fable 1  2 and 3 were I never had more fun as an 11 year old
when I played the past fable games I wanted to immerse myself into the story.  I dont I repeat I dont want the real world to knock me out of the story when I see it appear.  when I play video games I want to enter the games reality not the real world reality  breaking the 4th wall .
dont you think they just mean they re going to use modern sensibilities into the morality systems  like the way right and wrong will work will be based on modern opinion of the actions. it could definitely work I dont see how it would ruin the game more so change the expectation from certain actions
well  more time to read good books. but yeah  losing fable really hits very near to the heart.
let s make woke fable instead of releasing a fable 2 pc port.
this world is doomed  wtf...rip fable  the game when it was a great little escape long time ago. glad melonie is covering this  makes it easier to digest  p
this is making me cry by title.  hope its not that bad
maybe all the devs dont have their heads in the wrong place already on this one  but the directors seem to. I loved the fable series. rip
well that kinda sucks. I grew up playing the first fable with my brother lol was really excited when I heard they were bringing it back but I guess this is to be expected now days unfortunately
even if they still have a evil and good its gonna be some wack shit like oh evil deed is either   not hug that person  or   hug the person but make sure its not too long  you know that way you dont get sexual harassment charges
man  this cut me deep. I was so excited to be back in albion.
fable tlc was actually pretty woke. it had crossdressing  the ability to have whatever sexuality you want as well as marriage  women and poc as heroes. the only difference was that it didn t feel the need to pat itself on the back.
can we get a remake where the team says  we updated the graphics and thats all!
how do these people keep getting ahold of everything we love !!
do you think they re going to have the fifty mischievous lawn gnomes you have to hunt down in the rebooted fable 2
fable has always been  woke.  this is a known fact. its literally on record as molyneux regularly getting into shouting matches with executives in conference calls because those executives were mad about gay marriage  y know  literally before same-sex marriage was legalized in the states even too  which itsounds like youre from   and thunder and whisper being black. they didn t want any black characters  or gay marriage in the game. the lost chapters even has many instances of  wokeness  if thatso offends people. remember the bordello quest line  that would be considered woke in this day and age.fable 2  they literally doubled down on it by giving us garth in the way they did  which subverted the stereotypes of how british people tended to view black people then  and gave us a whole questline involving a young man coming out to his father as gay. the executives didn t even want the player character to be able to be a woman either  so we got lesbianism too if one swings that way. not to mention the fact hammer as she is  was an entire slap in the face about the expectations of what a woman could  and should be doing. as well as what a woman could  and should look like.cant speak for fable 3 because I never played it. but just taking into account how one  and two were. I can make a pretty safe assumption that fable 3 was the same in whatever capacity it represented.like. if someone s gonna complain about fable  going woke.  they re obviously not a very big fan of fable. because fable has always been about being progressive with adult oriented humor.
this bums me out. the entire point of fable is to be evil.
damn! the trailer made me so happy. why does everyone have to destroy everything
oh you ll still be evil in the new game. its just that they will update how the  attributes  of your character will change to reflect your choices and actions. Im betting the more  evil  your character becomes  the more  white  and  straight  your character will be. you might even end up with a blonde combover and orange spray tan if you max out your  meter .
@eyes of ascension  lol! instead of devil horns we get to be the orange man
lawl !!   - crunchy chicken
in fable 2 Im max good max corrupt  I beg to differ. the point of fable is to have a fun adventure
isn t it the freedom of choice
not necessarily but Im always aligning with the evil side in all games that have the option.
@immopimmo  evil  orange man lookgood  npc look  grey skin  bald head  with no expression
thank you!!
it is going to be evil. just not the evil we want
my sister picked a good character actually. not everyone picks evil.
you ll still be evil but you wont be any good tho.
no thats wrong  being evil is a choice. thats what fable is all about. its about the path you wanna take the hero on  you can be bad or good.
@immopimmo  if it hits pc .. this sooo needs to be a mod.
@eyes of ascension  you honestly belive you ll go trump besides  in the first game you already go super pale when youre max evil.
the first fable game is still my favorite with the customizing they had.  I dont play fantasy games  or games in general  to get anywhere close to a  modern take .
fml. loved this franchise.
in real life we gotta be good! press x to doubt
literally my favorite game of all time. the franchise was improving mechanically but going downhill in terms of story from the original release to f3 but Im entirely over the idea of a remake that involves anything aside from graphical improvements.
I just want to see fable 2 on steam. the franchise ended a while ago for me but it will be sad if they wont be staying true to there audience moving forward.
things that Ive seen are just so encouraging  makes me think of participation award-worthy
being a gamer going back to as far as the nes and master system Im done with most modern story based games at this point. looking back at my past year on steam I spend most of my time with the sim games. its sad when Im more excited for the next farming sim 22 update then I am for the next call of duty or fable or tomb raider. signalis has probably been my favorite game of the past several months so far.
I only do writing as a hobby  but at this point I feel obligated to step forward and start writing good fantasy  since nobody seems to want to do so.
you have great content I enjoy your videos. however I d like to make one suggestion. sometimes when you are talking there is a  puh  wind noise that happens. this happens on certain syllables when you talk directly at your microphone. if you position your mic slight to the side of your mouth so that when there are burst of air they dont go directly into the mic that will help to reduce or eliminate those.
molyneux still owes the gaming world what he promised with the original fable 20  years ago.
the new fable will probably be as exciting a launch as rings of power
here s all they had to do  update the graphics  rerecord audio if necessary  improve the combat  add a toggle in the options to set the frequency of the guild master talking to you through the hero s seal.  if they felt like it and it wouldn t break the lore  maybe add the option for the hero of oakvale to be female.  otherwise  leave it alone.
the problem with video games as a whole is that it used to be an escape from reality but now everything needs to be about real life and whats going on in it. video games cartoons tv shows all of it. people are too easily offended now.
upsetting to see fable be the next victim of wokeness  such a fantastic trilogy. its a shame it ll be dead on arrival. I used to be hyped for some nostalgic remakes reboots  especially for a metal gear one thats rumored to be announced. but now  I have 0 hope
putting wokeness into any form of media  is like putting ketchup into a pb   j.
when are these game devs just going to say  who are we kidding ! literally nothing can be woke and good at the same time!!!
man  I just hope the stalker team are okay  I know a lot of them relocated to another country to keep working  but a few people including some story writers stayed behind to fight in ukraine.
all the more reason to hold onto lost chapters
I got into gaming when I played the first fable. loved everything about it  the snarky quips by the villagers  the quirky side quests  etc. sad to see its going woke. I guess I wont be buying the new woke fable.
anyone who has played fable knows it has always been  woke .
if the marketing for the new game includes putting 2 and 3 on pc  that is a sacrifice Im willing to make.
@lark88  yeah  same. played 3 ages ago on pc but nowadays you cant get it anywhere  which infuriates me.
what he promised for fable 1 was delivered in fable 2.
they all have to have  the message .
remind me not to hold melonie s hand in a video game  sheesh. rip fable 3 guy
I almost bought a couple xboxs for Christmas presents last week... glad I didn t guess I ll consult my pc parts shelf.. saw wood toy build kits at lowe s this morning so this is actually working out...
idk. Im hoping it comes out good. I kinda like that the forza team is trying something new.when naughty dog moved on from crash and jak n daxter they came out with uncharted which was great. I dont think they re phoning it in. there seems to be a lot of work put into those forza games. why wouldn t they put thatsame effort into fable. Imean it allows them to broaden their themselves than more than just racing. haven t seen or read anything about the story to say anything about it. but them doing fable thats allowing creativity to see their spin on it.
I cant count how many times I sacrificed mercs to the darkwood chapel of skorm.  good times.
honestly I was put off this after the mean spirited trailer  I get dark humor  but the look of fear and terror on that fairy s face just before it gets eaten alive was horrifying.
damnit  Ive been waiting for this game for years  now I dont even want it anymore.
I would take a series  make it woke to an extreme over the top degree  and then present it to the executives. they would probably tear up over how good it was. I doubt they would get the sarcasm. we live in a clown world except its not funny.
if they had a passion for these games they would not be trying to make it woke.
they re going to remake fable  I loved those games!
this is nothing short of destruction of art.
awww... the lost chapters  my all time favorite fable.
oh so familiar lines others have said about the franchises we love and have since ruined.  when will they learn... probably never.  the fable games were so much fun to play  especially fable 2.
I haven t even watched the video Im so hesitant to because I dont want it to be true. Ive been waiting so long for a new fable and we finally get one but its going to be like this  its almost like they are saying oh you want a new fable  well here s the catch its going to be defiled with so much woke crap you wont even recognize it as a fable title  we are just going to throw the fable title on it to make people interested but then go so far left field with it that there wont be no good plot  actually there wont be a plot at all it will solely focus on the woke agenda so we have a new fan base f the original fan base they aren t woke enough for the new reboot fable
melonie with another great video
fable was one of my first games I ever played its so sad to hear this news
lol at sacrificing the character
I cant imagine anyone else I d rather be sacrificed by in a blood ritual
I think it merits thanking these companies for saving me so much money in the past 4 years.
fable 2 was my favorite too!
melonie great content thoughts on games like sleeping dogs and max payne games and yakuza games
because of two words  two words
@cynthia andoh  no. because of a behavioral pattern.
@say they say  the pattern of two words makes you disregard an entire product and its gameplay  story  etc. yeahhhhhhif it was something like  nft  that would be understandable. but someone saying it will be updated for modern audiences doesnt seem like an issue. and there was a previous fable dev on twitter who denied it being quote on quote woke or at least what people call woke nowadays.
@cynthia andoh  lol
they re gonna try to hide details until release so they can maintain sales and avoid bad press. then they re going to get press over dropping the game without giving any previews. the new meta is opacity...
well fable is a hard pass for me already then!!
read the title and my stomach sunk a bit    also still annoyed we never got fable 2   3 on steam
there has been quite some time that I only play indie games  crafting games and city building games. outside the big franchises the gaming industry is better than ever  specially considering that the old games are still available for people to play  and specially for someone like me  that is 39 years old  so I dont mind games being simpler graphically. chivalry 2 is the only competitive online game that I play  and it wasn t woke washed. so there are many options  but while in the past I would crave the more expensive games from big franchises and big corporations  that needed a better computer to run as well  its kind of refreshing that you can play better games expending less money.
I have that one grayskull meme stuck in my head now. the one where its says  I dont want to feel good I feel be evil
they can make the game woke by completely changing the game and still calling it  fable . pretty simple. I twill be called fable  it just wont be fable.
the highly unfortunate woke washing aside  disappointing  but not surprising   I d really love to sit down for a conversation with whoever said  hey  you know thatstudio that is exclusively known for racing games  btw  pretty much the antithesis of rpg s imo   we should have them reboot this iconic rpg franchise   and also whoever didn t immediately tell that person that they re a moron.
playground is actually a really good studio. they show what they can do in forza horizon. I can imagine they can do rpgs easily.
said it many times  I just want fable 2 and 3 on pc.
I just wanna know where the factory that makes hot gamer girls who are not into woke garbage  is at... cause this is a first for me and Im so pleasantly surprised
I was never big on fable and even I am saddened by this
please God dont let this be true
now Im almost glad my character is not popular enough for them to change and itstays true to how I want it
wouldn t be an original melonie vid without her slapping her mic
9 28 lol love you girl... my brain and mouth get me like this all the time. Im just like did I really just mispronounce a basic ass word
at this point they re just telling fans  haha its ours now suck it!
thats the way it is now mel  you have to check all of the boxes when you make a video game.
they can shove their drivel. I have thankfully become a distant observer and only play older titles. the gaming industry like many others have lost their glory days  apart from some worthy indy titles .
good video. I have faith in playground games  forza horizon 5 was kinda woke diverse whatever you want to call it. but it was is also one of the best games on xbox  it is fun as hell. anytime you hear this stuff  its major red flags though
let s sum up what we lost to wokeness now  obviously fable  tomb raider  saints row
same but 3 is on pc
the struggle
fable reboot  you can be good  or you can be woke.
so sad. I was looking forward to trying the franchise out. I never had a xbox growing up so I never got a chance to play them. Im so close to giving up on all new games.
r.i.p fable.
I love fable and hope they dont mess this up. its any ones guess on if its gonna be good or not. also love your hair.
just one more game thats off of my wishlist to play.
my heart breaks fable was the one the games wished they just made a good one  new one I dont want woke ahhh makes me sick.my soul cry s
I seriously will never understand like sure the stuff sells a bit but it fails more than succeeds... do they not want people to buy their stuff  when they put this nonsense in entertainment typically the stuff fails hard so Im confused at this point
the woke mafia cant be stopped  even rockstar bows before their mighty rainbow half-cut hairdews
welp. at least fable 2 still exists.
thank you melonie  not buying a next gen console. save me money I guess v.v
could be a good thing  depending on what they mean  it doesnt need sex and arguably doesnt need guns as many of us like the first game the most and it didn t have guns  just needs to be fun  Ive been playing the series since I was a teenager and by the time this game comes out my kids will be like 8 so I d like to be able to play in front of them
not a woke version of perfect dark! I loved that game...
well  I knew this was gonna happen. Imean they did something similar with the last of us.
the trick is  you do not consume the actual game or movie  you enjoy the fallout on youtube  that is often quite hillarious
we re at a time where I see  ip you love  re-boot and cry
hopefully it doesnt turn out bad but how many woke projects can you say that about truthfully. even after so many failures I dont understand how so many still think its worth doing. wish we could just have some good entertainment back without pandering  I just want to escape reality when I relax and play games  not jump into more of the same bs I have to deal with in real life. thanks for the heads up on this melonie and for the video!
fable was a good game. it will be missed after its brutal murder
Im 28 and I been gaming all my life  its getting to the point where Imight just stop gaming for good  because all my favorite games and game companies are just being taken over by microtransactions  woke idiots or people that are making terrible decisions on the franchises direction... battlefield  bioware  halo  the last of us  bethesda  rockstar games  ea  and so much more... I honestly find myself playing older games more than newer games these days.. and Im dreading the release of the new mass effect and dragon age games  because those are my 2 favorite franchises  and I know Im gonna be severely disappointed
did you just say you prefer fable 2 than fable 1   that would be the first time I hear somebody say that...
we ll always have the lost chapters
u can get the original 3 on the microsoft store on xbox for a couple  10. it ll be the 360 versions but they re still fun   if u never played em then its a steal
no its not
@trencher1375  oh yeah  you have insider knowledge  you can predict the future  or did you assume  Im leaving criticism at the door until I see the finished product.
@tdgaming  yes I can predict the future. it will be woke.
it cant work   fable was a british made game the hunour is based on britains hunour whoch even today offends some americans  their modern sensabolities will strip it down to a cheap americanised unfunny  mess
@demonic_myst  thats a very strong bias against a broad spectrum of people  dont really agree with those views. that would be like me having an issue with one german but hating on every person in europe itself  to broad of a brush stroke to have any actual substance. but its highly likely this game wont work just because of the woke agenda. also ever hear of spellcheck
let cover promising projects as well. yes many proprieties fall apart.
I just dont understand why fictional characters should be related to a modern agendas and politics when the fact that video games are just games  and nothing is personal about it  its a craft  its an art  its an entertainment  why  I seriously dont understand modern standards now  its too confusing.
this was the first game I played that lied to me about its features xdits pretty common nowadays tho.still waiting to plant that tree!
I think this is jumping the shark because halo infinite was a no see rn take and I loved thatstory have faith
fable got itself a booty call  but not the one you would want.
wow ! mel  good for you!! Im  glad you stated you are a Christian  as I am as well!! I loved sony and sucker punch s classic- innovative good  vs evil game series  infamous  as well too !!  but  yuppers   I am so avoiding this like the black plague in fable too !!  wokeness in our gaming !!  as mr. wong so eloquently said- hell to the no !!
fable was a game where you could fart in people s faces
noooooooooo!!!!!! God fucking no!!!! I was sooooo looking forward to it too .
watch when some of choices are our character responding to quest givers like  taxation is theft  bop you grew horns!
when the kids of today hear gunshots in their own school hallways im sure they will at least appreciate that games dont have dirty jokes in them anymore
ffs. I was looking forward to a new fable.
matt should also update his surname for modern audiences.
why am I not surprised this is happening
wokeness kills everything  they finished off saints row.
my first time playing fable 2 ended abruptly when I got to many women pregnant and I had to work nonstop to pay the bills  admittedly  a solid lesson for young males . hopefully  now  my character wont be encumbered by patriarchal expectations and I can get back to running around and killing stuff without having to start a new game.
well if they are making it for a  modern audience  then I ll take my money and support developers with  older sensibilities  you know  when we didn t give a crap about what people thought and made something good.
why must everything good be destroyed
oh I really hope not I really enjoy the fable franchise . this was going to be a day one by for me even though I have game . perhaps now I shall wait before even playing it
fable  the woke chapters.jaqueline of bladesohhhh its gonna be terrible.
the main questline will be finding a doctor who can perform your sex change.
I feel your pain
exactly my take  darn sad to see
dont be so ridiculous
so true. Im sure you ll be able to choose special pronouns too
@prescelto lives  oh God....just the thought of various pronouns in a freaking fable game. doesnt even make sense considering the time period regardless of the magic and what not. lmao
@huey  the sad thing is that it doesnt even sound ridiculous.
@prescelto lives  they brought pronouns to forza horizon so I bet thatshit will show up in this game to.
they better leave one of my favorite game series of all time alone! I d rather not have a new one if they are going to take it that way
wait...melonie s worried about the  bad guy  options being removed  she s underestimating wokeness - they re going to remove the full spectrum of human choice. the woke cause isn t a  let s make everything good  mentality  its a  let s make everything  meh   mentality. fable reboot  if its as woke as we fear  is going to be like playing a grey bunny in a ctv channel 3 static snow storm...
you should watch the live bounding into comics stream - great conversation and interesting things to yap about
yeah  this reminds me of when they were talking about the sequel to bloodlines being updated for modern sensibilities - thereby removing the things that made the original engaging.  as a person with schizophrenia  I was especially disappointed to hear they d be altering the malkavian to make them more  sensitive  and not  ableist .  fuck that  I want magic crazy vampires!
so are they finally adding the option of necrophilia in fable remake
I really want my fantasy escape from reality to more resemble the actual reality I live in  - said no one ever.
all I can say is  noooooooooooooo!!! glad I own all original copies
so when you go more evil your character gets orange skin  blond hair and gets a red cap  and when you go more good alignment you character gets much older  talks gibberish and starts to sniff random child npcs
when ever a game says its being made for a modern audience run away
if they really make it woke that would be disappointing  the fable trilogy has been literally my favorite games since I played the first game like 15 years ago  and see it falling that low would be sad
fgs. Ive not watched this vid just yet but man I remember fable on the og xbox 2004  my first rpg. what memories. just so many things nowadays being gutted and destroyed for these  modern audiences  who aren t even fans of any of these beloved franchise s but nooo make them priority cause they re the one s that will always come out with the dumbest shit
oh please no. fable is one of my all time favourite franchises. I have been waiting years for this game. I do not ever want a fable  reinterpreted    modernised  or  deconstructed . I simply want ye olde britain with british humour  not  for a modern audience   which is an absolute death sentence to the fun  warmth and heart of the originals. you just know melonie that being trans will bring you good alignment and free speech will bring you closer to evil on the spectrum in the new game.
I was so excited for a new fable game  I have played every fable game several times. now I am disappointed  another game I have to put on my  wait for the reviews and let s plays first.  list.
I really hope booty is speaking more from a high level of ignorance rather than a intimate understanding of the game thats being built I ll do my best to reserve my fears until the game is shown officially
melanie youreally pronounced the emphasis on  booty
reminder that you dont have to buy it. the lost chapters runs on win 10 and its already perfect.
are you more a gamer  or a collector  just curious.
I dont mind adding some woke characters to the game  as long as you can sacrifice them all to the temple of skorm lol
thats why I keep my original physical media. when they  modernize  a game  I can play mine and pretend the new one doesnt exist.
this really chaps my ass. not only did it get me into gaming  but it got me through some hard times    rip fable
yeah. you do have a couple woke characters in valkyria chronicles 4.. I like that you dont have to have them in your squad. you can even get them killed if you want..
I loved fable. go woke go broke.
c mon man I hope they dont kill my game....
im just curious where the article says they are getting rid of the alognment system  because thats something the devs have said that they are keeping so.
no wonder fable news has been so quiet
I wonder how long this woke nonsense will go on for
if your old enough to remember jaguar and comadore64 then you know that gaming was at its height in the ps2 to ps3 era. modern gaming it appears to be all about pandering to this crowd or that crowd.
they need another fable right after fable 1 hero at the same era or timeline fable one is my favorite and the best one
does this mean no more crunchy chick demon door
I swear to God  thats like someone pointing a gun at somene  shooting that person   replacing that person with a worse version of that person. and the cycle never ends.
a passion for x  is wokespeak for  a lust to destroy x.
you know... o e the first fable is really good. what worries me is the elder scrolls
thank the Gods I  still have my older systems.
once doom goes woke  the world should just end.
one time games were all I had and now they are taking that away from me
when devs are  given an assignment   often taking over a franchise they have nothing to do with  and genre s not even their wheelhouse  - they often use vague and non-starter statements about understanding the brand and blah blah. this is often a huge red flag. a bigger red flag than the  modern audience  diatribe.they didn t say a single thing that expressed a knowledge of what made fable special and quite frankly it doesnt sound like they even played it  just like tomb raider . this is dead in the water.
when will the entertainment industry learn that going woke always ends in financial ruin  when did they forget that the purpose to is to entertain the fans and not piss them off  without the fans  they have no future. this is basic knowledge ffs.
Im a big xbox fan and I so believe the game will be amazing since its playground games. they re a very talented company  but they re very woke.forza  for whatever cringe reason  asks for your pronouns
I watch the fps podcast and I saw that interview.  maybe it was his tone or something  but I didn t get the sense that booty was implying what it looks like in the article.  granted  it looks worse in print  but at the time  itseemed like he was trying to explain and defend why playground was doing fable when they were known for racing games.  I could be wrong  but other than that 2 second phrasing  nothing he said in words or tone seemed to indicate an emphasis on making it woke.
I dont know that there s been a great fable game since fable 1. there were  good ideas in f2 f3 but they didn t really come together to make a great game since they literally took out the already slim ability to lose and the anticlimax of f2 is still a bitter taste.
fable was the adult version of the legend of zelda
none of the claims she made actually showed up in this article  they were just based on the title. funnily enough  even the article itself didn t relate to its title. seems like she saw the headline and got pissed because of her own baseless speculation.
oh  es6 will likely be uber woke. I fear for mass effect too.
@dying rose  I fear for every upcoming game
@chr0n1cle  youre on a non woke channel bro sorry man
art is timeless and should be treated as such if you ask me. if there s material that may be  offensive  to some  they should do what destroy all humans 2 remake did or mafia 3  heck woopI gave a disclaimer on tom and jerry back in the day on disc copies due to the stereotypes in it instead of cutting them out since that respects the history of that time  and history is a reminder of what to and what not to imitate.
oh great! the last fabel game just got announced!...
not going to lie  I always felt fable was kind of woke to start with.  my experience was mainly with fable 2  but they were heavy on the good path being vegan and ass-kissy  and if you tried to be a good character you were swarmed with people  men and women  who wanted to bone you constantly.  meanwhile  if you were  bad  you ate meat  you stood up to villains  and people would spit on you in passing because you weren t  by their definition  a goody-two-shoes.  even if you were all thatstood between them and annihilation  they didn t care.  you ate mutton and therefore you were a monster.  contrast this to the modern world and you can see the parallels.
modern sensibilities might be in terms of design and gameplay. doesnt necessarily mean writing.
in modern-day fable they will make itso that when you sacrifice someone on a pentagram you ll probably get good karma lol
I guess fable truly did die with fable 3
so sad. fable is my favorite and Imight have bought an xbox just to play it if it was exclusive.
matt talking out of his surname
lol I cant wait to see the  evil  alignment choices in game. if the game turns out to be bad then I hope it goes so hard it enters parody territory so at least I can get a laugh.
how would a woke reaver even work  also  pretty sure some modern  who wont play the game and never have played the games  audiences would be offended by being mean to chickens. then you have the gargoyles and gnomes sure some would find them offensive too. I agree  just dont see how fable could be  updated  for modern audiences and remain the same fable.
to quote the original fable commercial.  for every choice  a consequence  I hope youre ready to face your consequences for making this decision
we went from boldly kicking chickens and thrusting our hips in celebration to pathetically telling overweight chickens they re  perfect at any size  in support of body positivity.
never trust a guy who s last name is  booty
honestly the fable series has always left a bitter taste in my mouth. the games were fun and all  but all I could ever think of was the difference between what peter molyneux promised  and this was back when molyneaux s name kinda meant something  and what we got. sucks to see it go woke  but like you said  better any good franchise die than live to see itself become a villain.
nooooo not another one! I really liked the original fable games.
my disappointment is immeasurable and my decade is ruined.
only thing the fans can do is boycott these woke games.  it is a shame that the fans wont get a fable remaster they were hoping for but the game isn t out yet so maybe there is hope that they may listen to the fans.  the sonic movie was a prime testimony in that.  I know I was the first to criticize it but ended up loving the movie.
for me its an instant  no sale  on fable.
with anything like tv shows or movies  the creators should put it to a vote. you want us making everything suck with  wokeness  or not.
I cant judge this article till they actually show off gameplay.  but I agree if they remove a lot of what make fable fun and interesting then its gone woke
yeah but thats why many of us agree that you were supposed to be bad lol.
I bet that male player was happy to finally get a girlfriend only to be sacrificed later on.
I ll be passing on this one.
instant sub love the energy
I remember fable the lost chapters  but never got to follow the series after that.  my pc at the time was held together by duct tape and super glue.  but man o man I remember it was a cool game.  r.i.p. fable for the peeps who loved the franchise.  Im still pissed about the direction of halo.  lmao
I think its a bit early to assume this is going to be ruined  just give itsome time aye
fable has been pretty woke  so Im hoping this means more serious. less farts
woke washing   I love that. instead going toward 97  of the community.. they re going for the 3 .. thats a yikes. rather going for money.. they want to lose money.
the more people buy games for modern audiences  the more they ll make them. so vote with your wallet people
well  thats  59.99 I get to use for something better!
so basically another company wants to head towards bankruptcy. they must hate money and fans
Ive been trying to warn gamers that microsoft is going woke  same for sony  but people never believe me. you can literally see it in the shows that they  microsoft  greenlight   in their games. granted  its not as woke as say netflix  amazon  disney  hollywood etc  but it is there and its growing. and it frustrates me how normies dont see it.
daaaammmmnnnnn fable!!!!  was  awesome!  God help movies and games!! and battle toads!! nooooo !! I loved the original!
man  they really dont want me to buy an xbox. Ive been saying   I ll buy an xbox when I get a new fable.  for an entire console generation. then they went and said this. I guess Im sony nintendo for another gen.
itsucks the woke gamers represent such a small fraction of the community yet have the most impact. I been in a large number of gaming community s. the woke gamers cant ever really agree on anything they destroy themselves all the time. the funniest part is in those community s they will say people need to be accepting of different ideas while they mute any ideas they dont like. I been in channels where the woke people will be strong advocates for things they think until its shattered and they dont know what to do. its like older gay people I happen to have talked to are not allowed to have a voice as some of them dont like many things being pushed in video games yet let some young woke person hear that and they screech. story telling is basically dead so long as this woke culture drives it.
vote with your dollar. I cancelled my preorder of harvestella when I found out square enix added a 3rd gender
lol no  please. first time reading this. fable was such a good game. sad times we live in
Im looking forward to woke grand theft auto
as someone who s played fable for 20 ish years.. I can say with absolute certainty that this is not what I want. if anything I dont wanna touch it with a 10 feet long pole. holy cow. Im about to just throw in the towel on new games and media.
like saint rows reboot catering to a playerbase that does not exist fans asked for more realism and toned down sr like saint rows 2  with a cast of characters the devs think the youth actually act like that the humour of fable is one of the key element also the chooise of being a hero or as a baddie kicking chickens.why I love indie games more these days  they go their own way both in a narrative way and boundries that other big studios shy away from these days.
for a man named mad booty he seems to get none of it
I think rockstart  and cdpr are the only companies that are not woke in the gaming industry right now. I was excited for halo but I also raged quit that  I haven t tried playing it again  along with fallout 76  I quit because it was soo woke. last game I finished was cyberpunk2077  and fallout 4  breath of the wild  and xeon blade one. out of all the games I have played lately. I partly blame this all on getting old  but it also could be the reason you have mentioned here.
in the voice of jeremy  re-imagined
I feel like the funniest way to play fable is just being as obnoxious as possible to all the towns people lol. if they take that away from me I dont want to play it.
thank God my game daoc is still going great
well  they cant hemorrhage money forever. and I think we re hitting that point.
I feel like now is finally the time when the general consensus is that everyone has had enough of the woke narrative and I really do feel like its gonna start to get better from now on. sadly all the games that are being released now are the projects and stories that were green-lit like what 4 or 5 years ago when the woke agenda was still the strongest so we will still be getting woke games for at least another year before itstarts to get better
the irony when their so called  modern audience  are better at crying on social media than actually buying the product.
is there any other video games that are going to be on woke list this year and next year and in future  anyway I am getting to be tired of hearing about our favorite video games that are being woke by woke people who dont like these types of video games and I just want them to know that these are great and awesome video games to play and I just want them to have a chance to play them and decided if they like these video games or if they dont like and hate these video games and have them to find something else to talk about instead of being woke for these video games  ok melonie. anyway I just wanted to make a comment about this topic of this video and I just wanted to tell you that you look absolutely beautiful and lovely in your sleeveless black shirt and with your hair up in ponytail melonie. anyway hope you have a wonderful and great blessed day today at home with your pets and with your parents and hope you continuing to have a wonderful and great blessed day and evening and have a good night too melonie. anyway also God bless you and God bless your hard work that you do to put your time in to make these wonderful and great videos on your youtube channel every day for us to watch and make a comment on these videos. anyway God bless you melonie.
I wouldn t be surprised if the new saints are in the game as well
why the heck does everything have to be woke these days!
you get your hopes up thinking this will be great. then they say this phrase  update for a modern audience  and all excitement dies.
blasphemy what you did to that fable npc mel! lol
evil can only corrupt  as it cannot create.  summarization of jrrtolkeins underlying comment towards politics.
the only reason Ive stayed on the xbox. sad times. sad times indeed.
thanks for warning people by saying it will be fixed for modern audience   gets modernized. these companies save me so much money
suddenly fable iiI is no longer the worst fable game.
please tell me his name ain t actually matt booty
microsoft said they needed more exclusives. they didn t say anything about them being good.
you cant have any good game if its woke lol
its almost like these studios companys want to lose money. how many times do they have to learn this lesson  at this point its become painfully obvious some financial entity is pushing this agenda throughout media.
I dont know how to tell you this  but both cdpr and rockstar have also gone woke. gta6 will be  toning down offensive humor and no longer poking fun at marginalized groups  and cdpr is hosting feminist lectures and actively seeking out  diverse  developers for their new studios.
@keiichi81  not really you get a choice to be a guy or a girl. gta hasn t done that either  unless your looking at the whole being offended by transphobia.
@nosaj ttimmed  rockstar is going woke as shit and sadly gta6 will be their first victim. they proudly told us a while ago.
@fejkpirat  well lets just give it time and see.
fable was the entire reason I got the original xbox. this is disheartening. rip in peace  chicken chaser
when will companies learn.
this has me skeptic  but God of war had changes from its og trilogy to its norse saga and it has been nothing short of a masterpiece. ultimately  this has lost some of my excitement  but I am holding out hope.
thank God that I still have my original xbox that I softmodded and my xbox 360  so I can get the original fable games if I want to own them.
you cant make a good woke fable   well Imean they cant really do a non woke fable well either....
thats sad  fable was such a legendary game. still have the original fable on first gen xbox lol
thanks melanie helped me save money lol.
well I was looking forward to the new fable game
as long as we can still kick chickens. I ll be fine with it. best thing about fable is the sarcasm  deep dark british humour.... that ll be gone
fucking 100  accurate
Im not sure what the fuss is. fable was literally woke for its time  letting players marry the same gender and even labelling characters bisexual if they ve had sex with each gender. the only real things they d be changing to adapt to modern audiences is the use of romanI slurs in the second game or the portrayal of sex workers.the actual concern you seem to have is that fable s comedy will suffer if the game is censored  which it would  but going  woke  and refusing to be dark are arguably two different things. based on the trailer which did capture fable s tone pretty well  I think your concerns might be unfounded though this game will probably be weaker than its trilogy when it comes to tone which probably is less about  going woke  and more about the team generally struggling to find that tone in their own work which I think is inevitable and I will be surprised if they fully capture fable s tone.
they better not go woke.
fable 1-3 was great.... what a damn shame
I dont think they know who their target audience is
its a shame  this game would ve been thee only reason I would ve bought a series x.... oh well. maybe I ll see what reviews have to say about it.
I bought all of the original games  I ll just replay those instead.
woke nope!!
shouldn t it be the option to play as woke. like a new play style  since its supposed to be open ended and left to player freedom.
yes let s cater to the audience that wont play the game big brain move
you should do a stream about how fable 3 was also woke given that the plot was surrounding a fascist king who was tyrannizing the working class citizens of albion. Imean it couldn t have been that the game was critiquing aristocracy and capitalism as it emerged out of feudalism and aristocratic society
well there s not much to ruin in the fable ip its been poop for a long timethe witcher games that are going to be wokified are a kind of a bummer but Ive been looking at the indie games lately and some jp titles are getting some much deserved follow ups that wont be woke.
dont have to be  good  in rf  just not too  bad   p
I did not even know you played the battletoads. what s even more surprising is the fact you played it with the bad art style. I could not even try to give it a try off the art style alone.
well I was looking forward to it  I guess I can pass on it now.
peter molyneux had seriously high ambitions for fable  even more so for bc  unfortunately canceled  on the original xbox. as luck would have it  he failed spectacularly to bullseye the mark he set while simultaneously making a damn good and fkn fun game. I never owned another xbox after the debut console  my knowledge of any follow-ups and spin-offs is nil. but I remember fable fondly for it what it brought to action rpgs. its an absolute shame how this pc sjw woke agenda has systematically ruined franchise after franchise  regardless of genre  simply to appease a particular set of nonsensical non-fans who have zero interest in whatever franchise is being destroyed for them. so  it well and truly sucks that fable is being foolishly fashioned into another brick in the wall.
I am honestly quite surprised. cause having replayed fable 2 not to long ago  you could already say that the old fable games were pretty  woke  by todays standard  same-sex romance and marriage   male hero in womans clothing. etc...the only difference I canthink of is that would be that npc now would no-longer laugh at you if you run around with male hero in a dress  or that an overweight character no longer counts as unattractive stat-wise. and if that were the only changes  that would not be tooooo bad  cause people could still make there good looking heros in heros clothing and would not notice anything as changes goes....if that were the only changes there are going for. big if  cause I too no longer trust game developers
I wait till it comes out before I judge it.
perfect dark is my favorite shooter and joanna dark is 1 of my favorite female characters my favorite in shooting games but the newest perfect dark game will be a dumpster fire
this shit is the reason why I changed parties
I really cant think of anything from the original series that would offend a  modern audience .  maybe the farting  I d be ok if they got rid of the farting and chicken kicking and gave the game a slightly more serious tone.
can you make a video about the mortal kombat girls  just look at their designs from mk9 vs mk11 and you can see the wokeness.
hah!  well  I guess I wont be touching the reboot for this game then.  thanks for the warning!indie games seem to be where its at these days.
clearly they do not give a rats ass about fable if they want to bring it to today s social bs.  this was a game made by a english developer  with an english fantasy theme  and strongly influenced by english style comedy especially things like monty python.you cant do fart jokes  fat drunks  abusive factory owners  crazy nypho undead lady mayors  and actual evil player options in  modern sensibilities .
so it like microsoft might have had some financial inconvenience and probably sold them selfs to wokenessm s more than they would usually have
hmm... gotta  admit  never played it but... omg! are today s gaming studios so woke-washed and deprived of creativity  that it doesnt even suffice for a continuation anymore when the heck did the whole media-industry  beginning with hollywood and now even the gaming industry get so lazy  that they aren t even capable of picking up an interesting novel and make a movie or a game about it. not to mention interesting new stories or concepts. gosh its so depressing to see creative media go down the gutter... but I guess that happens  when you leave the decisions in creative business sectors  to giant capitalistic companies that are just about boosting revenue and not memorable pieces of art and entertainment.but if this depressing development continues  I really see no real hope in the future. especially for titles like the gothic series by piranha bytes from the early 2000 s which is also in the process of getting a complete  remaster  by alkimia interactive and thq nordic.
the fable series was my favorite game on the og xbox. there is exactly 0 reason to update it. if you dont want to keep the story  then dont remake the damn game.I hate that people cant figure this crap out  and I hope that we are all wrong about what we re assuming  though we all know thats pretty much a pipe dream .
I loved fable2  hell I even liked fable3 well the first half   this is bad news.
if fables wasn t dead before  itsure as shit is now.
mr booty is living up to his name
fable was balanced pretty good. it had plenty of adult innuendo and represented well without ramming it down your throat. should leave it alone
glad I still have the original installation media.
well I guess Im skipping out on the reboot. o well atleast Ive got other games to keep me occupied.  next year Im going to go broke considering the amount of games are coming out.
I used to lament that all of my favorite game franchises genres mostly died twenty years ago - wing commander  panzer general  command   conquer - but  looking at it in retrospect  its probably for the best that they dies before they caught woke cancer. like musicians caught by the curse of 27  they re forever young. its tragic for his family that kurt cobain died young  but at least the rest of us didn t have to watch him campaigning for hillary clinton and performing next to some young rapper with an indecipherable name.
we do want a remake to be for modern audience  regarding game technology. not regarding politics and story.
Im still wondering what gta 6 is gonna be like  since its made a  similar  announcement. - - in a world where running over pedestrians  stealing cars  robbing banks   stores  killing cops  selling every type of illegal drug   guns  picking up prostitutes    then killing them to get your money back   paying for topless lap dances    sexual puns in every business s name is the norm for decades  how can it possibly be  woke    still be anywhere near the same game
and I was so excited
as long as the dont molest black and white or black and white 2 with their nasty wokeness. I gave up on fable a long time ago when I beat it in 4 hours. fable was a very interesting concept with not nearly enough actual gameplay
I love how like bots these companies say the same boring thing
they had the fables on xbox game pass played through them all again and sad to see another loved title lost to wokeness.
I wouldn t know about that game Ive never played it I played all the God of wars all the batmans its sad that I ll never see another batman game ever done again because kevin conroy died they re going to have to find somebody to actually do his voice I do a pretty good impersonation of kevin conroy s batman spot on most the time but I dont think warner bros and dc is going to hire me
there s no creativity left in the world   we just keep remaking the old games we grew up with because we re all afraid to just grow up . if it ain t broke   dont fix it .
well even both mcdonald s and burger king will be woke for going vegan next
just play it on x box. still looks pretty good. honestly I didn t like fable iI and haven t considered iiI because the series got really goofy. Im trying to be nice.
stuff like this makes me fatigued and burned out by modern games and movies before they are out  or even made. it has reached the point that I dont care anymore. I love the first two fable games and also thought fable 3 was good or at least ok. but this is all it takes in this day and age  now I dont care about anything new with the name fable attached to it at all anymore. woke shit and or shady business practises have pushed me into retro gaming. I would love to be optimistic and joyous towards new stuff. but it has reached the point where playing a 20 year old game is more exciting and feel more new and original than the  new  big budget ventures. and I simply dont care about modern western games and movies  except for indie titles  anymore.
also check out - the ninja knight. think you two could get along on thoughts and beliefs !
the last one I played gave you  evil  points for eating meat  so I am not surprised.
all the guy said was  just trust us bro  while providing nothing concrete.
fable already fell on hard times with 3 and journey... also as I recall the game was already pretty  progressive  as it was. same sex marriages  cross dressing   diverse body types   see sister hammer from fable 2 . strong female characters  teresa  your mother  and briar rose from fable 1  hammer and teresa again in 2  fable 3 was kind of a major shitshow so I dont really remember much about it at all. racial  diversity  with thunder  whisper  etc.they already hit practically all of the check boxes... albeit naturally so it didnt feel obnoxiously forced. what are they going to do  shoehorn pronouns and trans people into the game somehow
updated for modern sensibilities.  translation    the jokes are gonna be flatter than a ten year old boy.  your main character wil be a ten year old boy  in sound and looks  but you can call it a girl   because all the main characters are gonna be girls and they are going to do every thing for you  because girls are way more awesome than men. the game is going to have 90  black characters   5  latino characters   3  oriental  1.9   unspecified dark skinned characters ... and .1  white ... of course that .1  are going to be all the villians .. because white people are evil . and this is true diversity.
to be fair fable was always pretty woke  you could always be gay  and youd have dudes fancying you and stuff  dont really remember what the whole race inclusion side of things was like but it was always woke
the answer is yes.
fable was a story about a boy or girl starting from small beginnings a and becoming a hero or villain. what exactly is wrong with that formula
perhaps they mean like adding female characters and customisable options
even molyneux would not fall that low  sacrifice thousands of fans wishing to experience what was foretold years ago  just for the subjective mental peace of four human creatures  persons
basing this on not a single screenshot or trailer for the game. maybe jumping the gun a bit  I ll keep my pitchfork in the shed for now.
fable  I thought they closed down decades ago..
fable has already been rebooted. graphics were already updated and made usable on modern pcs. but hey  if they wanna waste their money  Im more than happy to stand by and laugh.
I was going to buy it. now Im not. thanks for the headsup
wait wait wait  theres a guy called booty wow  highschool must ve been hell
well we certainly dont want to insult the feelings of fictional characters that have never existed...
no say its not true not fable
how about they not reboot any franchise like this and just create something new for  modern audiences   is it because they know it will not do well and if they know that  does that mean their intention is to destroy these franchises   Im not talking about the actual devs  but the people in charge.
accelerate their demise! yes!!!
meanwhile  Im enjoying bleach  the thousand-year blood war anime adaptation  and could no longer give two shits about western ips. I know who truly want my money  my time  and my attention - and japanese entertainment seems to be the last beacon of entertainment left that is worth a damn. as long as these parasites dont interfere and change translations - Im confident that anime and manga will be the superior and dominant force of entertainment soon.
at this point we should start thinking about  if itstill makes sense playing games  its obvious the entire gaming culture has become extremely toxic towards more  conservative  people. why should we support people who legit despise us  thankfully these days Im playing barely any new games  and the ones I do  are for the most part japanese  tekken  resident evil  silent hill  final fantasy  to name a few
mark my words gta is going to be on that list someday you watch
not gonna lie  at this point  I am absolutely fed off with franchises I love and even grew up with go to shit  if they go woke  I ain t buying. period. anyway  Im an adult with a life  so I got limited time for games. I can get my fun playing older games  I dont need to have the lstest thing
see the thing about a  reimagining  as Ive stated before mel mel is that none of these people know the source material. or it looks that way when they create things from a movie aspect. someone sees there kid or friends like some show  game or movie and they do a re-imagining. this time its a game studio saying it who has done the project before. I dont think it will be too terribly  but fuckk the words reimagined makes me cringe
maybe microsoft should look at amazons stocks and shares to see how the woke stuff is affecting them  didn t amazon lose nearly a trillion dollars in the last few days
if anyone is shocked about fable 4 going down the drains  well it really started to go down hill after the very first one. let alone 2 or 3...despite my personal enjoyment of 3  it is a shadow of what made fable 1 great.
gta 6 now fable get woke  you go broke.
set it down in the fire next to saints row reboot its gonna be a dark cold winter
watch them use the  body a     body b  but only one of them is allowed to go fully shirtless while the other wears a bra like top...more reason to save old physical media or emulate stuff to preserve.
having too many games is called pile of shame having woke content in every game is called pile oh shit......
one of my favorite times in gaming was killing residents of a town  then coming back and buying their house  then renting their house out for passive income. its a shame they re making sure I dont experience great times like that again by ruining another game series.
they ve only using the name  fable  to get people to buy it off of nostalgia  because they know if they made their woke garbage under a different name  it wouldn t sell shit.
the moment we seen pronouns in forza  I knew fable was doomed
this is sad! real sad!
this is why Im happy I currently have a playstation 5. even with the political messages in some of sony s games. playstation still churns out decent games every so often. I have an xbox series s I barely use. lol
dudes name is a bad omen for how booty this game is gonna be if they keep going this route  straight cheeks
wait til the pendulum swings in our direction
this probably wont be the case. but it would be hilarious if they claimed its for modern audiences and then completely shits on wokism. just makes every woke character unbearably annoying and easily offended. wont happen but my God I wish this was a planned troll
at least there to scared to touch elder scrolls because tod would literally quit
I thought going woke for the modern audience is looking pretty smoothly. just look at the wonderful reception from the recent saints row. lol those nitwits can piss off. Im sticking to the originals not out of nostalgia. like splinter cell and rainbow six for example. after tom clancy s passing  they ve turned rainbow six into a prequel to halo with rainbow hairs and some stupid fortnite shit.and the direction they want to go for the next splinter cell game is one massive red flag. I say blacklist is the last chapter. ironically  I was actually hoping that other dude will take mantle as the next sam fisher to continue the legacy.seems like that wont happen at all sadly.
nooooooo  not fable nooooo! how  what  why  as if fable wasn t already made for literally everyone. but I can already imagine how all 5 trillion genders will be imagined and you can date get married and have sexual contacts with everyone and everything dead or alive.
why did they have to kill fable
I was bummed about how long it will be before a new fallout game comes out  but it probably wont be worth the wait with bethesda becoming part of xbox.
I agree. fable 2 is also one of my favorite games ever. so this woke remake can die. our beloved original will live forever in our hearts.
fable is the only game that let me go grab all the children out of town to sacrifice. if they have anything less than that  Im not interested.
lets be honest  the first fable was cool when it came out almost 20 years ago but its not a particularly great franchise anyway
well  let s just hope not.
if fable my favorite franchise of all time goes woke and doesnt have at least 60fps Im done with gaming. Im already upset what they did with kratos in God of war mad him woke. it ruined the whole game. so I just stopped and deleted and just watched all cutscenes because its a good movie.
God they just keep killing everything I grew up with -.-
sometimes I think there s a disturbing disconnect between peoples  perception of the deterioration of pop culture and their understanding of the current political climate.
perfect dark reboot is gonna be a wokie mess... I know its gonna be terrible...
getwokegobroke
this kills me. fable 1 is one of my favorite games of all time  2 and 3 kind of sucked in comparison in my opinion but they were still great games.
!!I just did a fan fiction oh this one if my favorite games. and I knew something was wrong.oh God please do not let the hurt my fable
from now on I will only be interested in games if itsays   for a classic audience .
how do you woke wash a game that had same sex relationships
playground games is extremely talented. them being developer isn t a reason to think it ll be bad. thats an extremely narrow-minded view
so things for adults need censored but nothing in school for children needs to be
I loved the fable series growing up and if they ruin the new game to appease the new hyper-sensitive cancel-culture  I wont waste my time or money on it.
lets be honest  expecting good fable after third game is naivety of the high rate.
fable has been ruined sense fable 2 I wasn t even going to touch it anyway
yeah  I cant wait for an rpg in which  every time I encounter a new npc  itstarts the conversation with my character annoucing out loud its pronouns...   ddd hI  I am taylor  before I give you this quest let me say that I go by they them! be aware that if you misgender me the quest will automatically fail...
have the not learned from that recent saints row reboot incident
like a dementor   updating for a modern audience  just sucks the soul out of whatever it targets........
watch them take away the karma system so you can only be  politically correct  or you dont get to advance the game plot
why take fable !
these games and movies are set in a completely fabricated world and built on the fantasy of the writers and developers to levels that cannot possibly be explained in our own world. I dont think any of these dwarves  orcs  monsters or even the people have had workplace sensitivity training. I dont feel comfortable with this  . I still cant believe how narrow minded people are nowadays. even with films  shows and games that they re not going to experience   they still want them as their standard. its pathetic.
most people are to comfy being sheeps
Im dreading it
why does everything have to be ruined
the one game I was looking forward to that wasn t on nintendo. I just give up hope.
spyro  dead rising  pokemon and now fable.. all my favorite games are almost dead  smh
I was interested in buying the fable reboot until they said this
fable reboot might add same sx romance and a trns slider. lmao
I dont get what s wrong with tomb raider lol confused those games were sick af
if they mess fable up  I only hope the modding community will step in to fix itjust like skyrim  when it released there was no nudity  no threesomes  no giant bouncing tits  no schlongs  you couldn t murder children now thanks to mods we have the freedom to do all of the above and more!freedom to be as fucked up as we possibly can is all we ever wanted from the world of games  freedom of choice! the whole point of fable is to be as rotten as possible the first time  to get all the evil out of our system  so that you can replay it a second time and be all goodie  to feel better about ourselves if you take the ability to be evil out of games then I wouldn t be surprised if there was a huge spike in real life aggressions  for real though
guess I ll never be a chicken chaser again....
I never got into this series  so for me personally woke fable has no relevance to me
dont think it will be woke due to someone working @tonyart95 on the game saying so.
is his name matt booty because he s constantly butt hurt  also  thats great! there goes one of the few games I was actually looking forward to playing. I stg people just hate my money or something.
fable was already a game where you could be good or evil  male or female. marry anyone and treat em like garbage afterward. perfect dark was just in general a great ass game.... goodbye my childhood.
if its teresa im with that
kingdoms of amalur re-reckoning is what fable should have become. xbox is dropping the ball with their exclusives. what the hell !
I played as a buff lesbian saint in fable 2  it was already  diverse woke .  now I fear its about putting in messaging and propaganda.
well  we still have the original games. update for modern audience is just a mean to taint even more the videogame industry with politics.
its sad how bad microsoft is now. they are just filling a catalog while trying to appealing to as many people as possible. when doing that you create a souless pos.
say goodbye to chicken kicking and farting in people facing... may they rest in peace.
me and my wife are selling all are gaming stuff  and buying guns bows and working out together. starting a team for bowling. we want to get into archery. these game company s convinced me to be the main character in my own game. love your channel!
wasn t fable iiI kinda woke
I have tons if videos on it  watch  tomb raider needs another reboot or it will fail  if you want to see the extent of woke washing that happened
here s to staying optimistic  but Im having doubts.
exemplary mindset
in fable 2 you could play as a strong black female lesbian if I remember correctly.  I dont understand what there is to change or make woke.
new tomb raider trilogy was pretty good.
all I want in fable is people shouting   he s a chicken chaser   at me . that is all.
nooooo...not fable. please not fable. one of my favorite series from that generation. haven t had a good fable in over a decade. last thing it needs is the woke treatment or given the  made for modern audiences  makeover. shit like this is gonna make me quit gaming. I cant handle all these series being bastardized.
babylon falls fable edition
a staple of fable is its monty python-esque humor which is half slapstick and half making fun of progressive ideas
luckily I sold off my series x a few weeks back. the lack of exclusives the last 2 generations is funnier than men thinking they can give birth.
these woke companies can all go bankrupt for destroying these ips
lol  I wouldn t say we lost a  great  franchise  we lost a mediocre franchise.  Imean if they want to kill fable off they should just do it  no need to make more trash to justify it.
noooooooo so sad  I was waiting to buy the new xbox just to play this
every time this happens I have just started thanking the company for saving me  60 -  70. no need to get mad. not worth the time to create some will thought out argument. just thank them for saving me money and move on.
Ive never understood the premise of making a story based in medieval times for a  modern audience . those are 2 vastly different time periods. thats one of the reasons why so much of this nonsense keeps flopping  because it isn t realistic.
what  ! the new fable is not a sequel its just a reboot and a woke one !!!for God sake!!!!!
fable was already as progressive as you could get. how on earth do they feel the need to ruin a game with politics
matt booty!  I dont know how you said that name without laughing  melonie. or  maybe Im just immature.
fable is definitely one of the more iconic rpg s. played all 3 of em  their stories dont need any  updating for modern blah blah . I remember in fable 3  I ended up buying every home in every town. whenever I wanted to shift my good evil scale  all I would do is either raise or lower the rent of all properties  then just afk for a few hours. when I came back  I d either have made little money but everyone loved me or made a boatload of money and everyone hated me. it was much easier than sacrificing people on that alter  though there were a few weapons and achievements thatstill required it lol.definitely a game that got replayed multiple times.sad to see yet another sacrifice on the alter of wokeness. we must win these culture wars  or a very dark  censored future is on the horizon...
I d say the sequels to fable ruined fable first. this is just parading its corpse around.
back to skyrim anniversary edition on switch
I stop playing new games and get back to my backlog of unfinish retro games.greed and politics is ruining gaming nowadays.
aha damn Im going to have to replay this video I was too distracted by melanie mac
you d think they d learn by now  but I guess not.part of the point of fable is you can be a total jackass  an evil piece of crap who just happens to fight a worse evil. I have no idea how you could possibly wokify it without it just not being fable anymore. especially the first  which effectively  is a game about meritocracy  you become the best by kicking everything s arse.
to be fair calling fable a great gaming franchise is probably pushing it. fable 1 was fantastic but the series dipped a little in 2 and fell all the way off the cliff in 3. but with this woke crap dont ever say it cant get any worse because it very well can.
modern sensibilities  is an oxymoron.
ah man  not fable dx. I loved thatseries. I can just imagine how the characters are gonna look. the female avatar looking butch  pronouns everywhere  etc...
microshaft  like ea  is just another place where games go to die.
we know fuck all about this game except now its gonna be woke. if thats one of the first things a game dev will reveal about their game  its obvious the focus isn t in making a good game but instead making a game built around  modern sensibilities . that right there tells me this game will not be worth my time. rip fable. sad.
Imean fable franchise was already lost with how terrible fable iiI was lol
I was thinking of wanting a tombraider legends remake. but nah...Im good.
with God of war ragnarok being a disappointment  I think the callisto protocol will be our last hope  it looks like it will be a solid game.
thats too bad. I was kind of looking forward to this.
calling it now. you ll be able to change your gender at will and the monsters need to ask you consent before they attack you. Jesus Im happy I still game retro
with cdpr officially annoucing the witcher is going full woke and now fable  all of my personal top 10 game franchises have been flushed down the shitter. the original dev team who started the development were industry vets  and with playground being exelent world builders and english  I thought it was a good match. till the reports came out the o.g. dev team was let go of due to artistic reasons  often these projects start of with the right people. as soon as these devs dont want to bow down they are replaced  we saw it recently at the initiative and also at obsidian and so many other studios all over the industry. this gen will be the climax of 12 years of woke infestation in gaming  and I really hope gaming finally will take the same massive losses comics   cinnema have been taking.
call of duty went woke as well! I tweeted out screen shots of the pride flag   progressive flag options in the game. and the worst part is  they have the most options. a freaking war game has this crap!
microsoft makes mediocre games now a days because they dont care about the ips they own. yet there are people that want them to keep buying up studios and publishers which would be bad... ms will either not use majority of the ips and butcher the ones they do use because they dont care about the games. they got them to pad out the gamepass library which sacrifices quality because they are released with a go broke subscription cost.
bruh...wtf  fable was diverse af.
I dont get why you would do this to fable  the game wasn t even a big ordeal  hell allowed for same sex marriage and tons of things of that nature.
problem is fabel has always been quite left leaning  and each iteration further pushed the boundaries.  this is just the natural next step.
I hope he picks you  sis
I slightly dissagree with  you cant have a good fable game if its woke . I think any game cant be good if its woke.
I will never take seriously anyone who is called booty
there s still bethesda not riding the woke train  as far as I know   and therefore hope for elder scrolls 6  fallout 5 and starfield.dont let me down  todd  in return I promise I wont complain  too much  about the engine
you could say the same about saints row and gta.
not possible. at least not if it has an established fan base.
actually  I remember fable 2 lecturing us about eating meat and how it makes you fat and tried nudging you towards veganism... I think it was pretty woke before woke was a thing.
stick with the originals until the pendulum comes back towards sanity
there s one re game on xbox that censored dismemberment...
yeah melonie more games  for  modern audience so good right  next fable sounding weird to me.
gaming is going down the pishadoo.
I said from the start that the forza devs were the wrong devs for this game. the  stories  they tell in forza are cringe as hell
daI was my first taste of the   ekow   agenda. they story line was fine. but the female character faces and hairstyles were masculine a f. then later on I bought mea first day out. yep  that was the last straw. I learned my lesson  now I wait and watch reviews for games I potentially want to buy. and if they turn out to be   ekow   bs. I wont buy it. this is what every    old school gamer   should be doing too.
ain t no  way
I dont mind woke  just depends on how its done. deadendia woke is one dimensional where male lead mostly just about them beinh trans. but you have another woke show owl house where their female lead them being bisexual isnt what their character is about. their sexuality isnt a personality default like most netflix characters. so if fable reboot is more like that given it is going woke  I d be fine with it.
this  modern audience  dont even play the games they make. then when it flips they yell at the gamers calling them every ist under the tree.
this new fable will be like borderlands 3. literally 90 percent of the characters in borderlands 3 were lgbtq. not lying about that. and the main character spent the whole game taking orders from strong empowered lgbtq females. not lying about that either. a good chunk of the story was centered around a male couple. not lying about that either.
thats why id prefer the rpgs of nintendo n playstation such as zelda  fire emblem  demons souls n grandblue fantasy relink
3 54 Im the opposite  in real life I like to be bad. and in video games I like to be good
it really seems like xbox does not give a single crap about their console exclusives anymore. thankfully  I only have an xbox for the backwards compatibility aspect and spend most of my time playing old games.
when has this strategy ever worked
another game I wont buy  shame I really liked the old games!
fable has always been fairly woke so this is nothing new. fable iI literally has a potion of transmogrification.the series is basically set in medieval england yet has multiple prominent black characters.gay marriage has been in the game since the original fable in 2004 and fable iI had male sex workers.
awww this is a bummer
I was thinking about getting an xbox this season.. but seeing how many of these franchises are out an out going woke before we even see game footage  I think I will just hold off.
itsounds to me like they should change the name of this  rebooted  ip to  fumble.
exactly.. never. so why do they keep doing this is what baffles me.
f   loved original fable creative developers back in the day seem to have control over their creations. they had an idea and a direction for this world character creation with whatever store they were doing  but here s the twist. it was theirs. they didn t give a fuck about the possibility of catering to this or that or what this person says or what that person says  or blah blah blah blah  blah blah. they didn t directly want to be mean or some shit  but it was their creation that they were passionate to get behind  and they wanted to bring it to life. they would feel that there could be much success in bringing this creation to life and its true sense.today from multI billion dollar company entities with uncomprehendible amounts of money financial backing thatstudios of old could only dream of  and then come  sis formation of a creative idea  or typically now we using old successes for reboots and shit  but instantaneously  the creative process becomes simply a catering and pandering one that focuses on trying to please every fucking thing out there. what this community says or what that company says or what this person said or that person  etc. etc. etc.. and the project and creation just becomes a conglomeration of pleasing everything out there and checking off every box possible and absolutely no passion or love or interest in bringing the creation to life in its true sense. its bog down by focusing on everything but the creative process. it becomes about making things appropriate for the modern-day audience and pandering to this or that. fuck off. the potential of what could be is already stifled because your focus and priorities are not on the project but instead on so many other damn things that dont have anything to fucking do with your damn creation. youre making it about that  youre injecting thatshit into it. fuck off.
they ll just replace the british humor with marvel-quipping and call it a day  and it ll never be funny or creative again.  since it ll go to gamepass  I wont spend a cent on the game itself  but I will play it when it comes out just because I occasionally like a garbage fire.
no! not fable!!!!!
that fucking battletoads game. what they did to that beautiful  sexy  wicked femme fatale... there s a special place reserved in hell.
I saw a video talking about a netflix movie for gears of war  Im kinda stoked  but I have a sinking feeling that its gonna go woke...par for the course for netflixa woke fable game would probably involve gay stuff like borderlands 3 s guns love and tentacles
failure before launch again... fable cant catch a break. fable tlc and fable 2 are a couple kings from the video game golden age. I did not like fable 3  it was a barely held together experiment that did not pan out. everything that came after was just sheer incompetence. I really wish they d leave fable alone  none are yet worthy to make another.
how was battletoads woke  I didn t think it was an amazing game but it was funny and the art was fine...
they leep chasing the mythical audience. curious to see what actually  needs updating ... like... what was wrong with the previous games
there is no modern audience. thats the truth... otherwise those woke games would sell well
dj khaled peeks around corner  anotha one
totally disagree. psychonauts 2 did this and the game is awesome. also  the studio producing the game is competent enough. also  fable needs a modern take because the gameplay did not age well.
as someone who supports being somewhat pc to an extent -- this announcement is just absolutely horrible. I love  love  love the fable series and how dark and crude the humour is  its literally what made the game sell so many copies all those years ago. this and gta both took jabs at people in a playful  non-harmful way but now its like everyone how forgotten that you cannot make a decent game in those franchises by woke-washing it. I seriously despise the idea of  making the game for modern audiences  whilst leaving out literally what made the game franchise sell. at this point if I had billions upon billions of dollars I would totally pay to have lionshead return to make this fable entry rather than get this garbage.
so that was you who sacrificed me.
fable is already pretty woke. cross-dressing  gay characters and relationships  and Im sure there s at least one crude trans person. I dont see how they d go more woke
updated for a whiney  entitled  fragile  self-righteous audience
a woke fable  a series that allowed you to kick chickens  fart in people s faces  or murder an entire family just to be able to buy their home for a good price the entire premise of the game was to be able to be as much as a saint or a sinner as you wanted to be -- offence was not a consideration.damn I hate this modern audience trend.
so  doesnt this just mean instead of fighting jack  we re going to fight some evil corporation with a white male ceo
no no dont say that about fable I loved that game I loved it way back when it was on xbox the original then I loved it on xbox 360
fable was already woke. you got evil points everytime you ate meat for crying out loud. judgey little bit
like fable one two and three  I like
dark queen especially got the woke treatment. beyond that the most egregious thing is that the game was just so ridiculously cheap and had abysmal writing
but all of that was a choice. now it will no doubt be a requirement to progress threw the story
the answer to this is simple   1  read the reviews   2  if there is any hint of wokeness or anything like diversity game design then dont buy the game.  soon the woke game designers will be fired and we will be back to normal.
running around and farting on people gave me great pleasure in fable games  gotta love british humor. this sucks  and as a Christian myself I have to admitsacrificing people in game was always a good time.
developers! developers! developers! developers!
this is disappointing but well why  why ruin it when honestly you could already do a lot of things in it and no one batted an eyelash before. fable was one fo the few games where you could be a guy and marry guys  dress up in opposite genders clothing. they didn t need to make it woke or  updated  for modern audiences if anything a slightly better character customization might have been nice.
so... do people know what  modern  means when they say this   because itseems to me like when they say  modern  audiences  they seem to think  modern  means  smaller.
eh  fable was never a  great gaming franchise.
has anyone played expeditions  rome  they went more for historical accuracy and I didn t see anyone losing their shit over women not having two names in ancient rome.
nooooooooooooooooooooooooo...... oh well it died after  2 anyways. love your content mel.
considering the vegan devs made eating meat make you evil in fable 2 it was always a lil woke
love you from saudI arabia and I love fable also
technically past games were woke already but we ll see exactly what they do  doesnt matter though the first game was the only good one. fable 2 and 3 were complete shit in nearly every aspect.
it was already progressive in what other game may you break wind in public and be applauded.
sigh. they should ve just released fable legends when they had the chance. remember that one
good thing I could care less for fable or the gta franchise. but they did remove genders in halo infinite.
I already knew fable 4 was going to be woke one the main reason I sold the series x. the same people the made forza horizon 5 are working on this game.
on the bright side doing an evil run on the new fable starting off as a white man will give you a headstart. wolf whistle at a couple of barmaids and you should be evil enough to use the one ring in no time.
I still own and play the original copies of fable  lost chapters and fable ii.  I have fable iiI as well but I didn t care for that one.  one of my favorite things to do when Im really really bored is speed run the first fable game.  I dont see how they can make the game woke.  you already have the good evil system  and you also have straight gay relationships and marriage!  how much more woke can you get   make every character not white   make everyone gay trans   if so  youre not going to make any money on this game.
this is so irritating with there let s revise the past and destroy it and I loved fable too. best thing about free choice and free expression in video games is you can be as woke or not woke as you wish pick a guy for your main character crossdress romance a whole bunch of individuals and lead them down to the black church for sacrifice if they re going to woke that that just means they got to add the problems and then solve the issues in the game
farting in people s faces and kicking chickens is peak fable. both are offensive to people. so how can you make fable without having anything  offensive
soooo  no more great  big ol  giant bosoms
you could already marry men in fable. it was already progressive. except for graphics and controls they shoud leave it alone.
they already announced a groundbreaking new karma system with more than 3 paths. so far it includes gay  bI  trans  queer and more than 142 other  unique  paths!
who is even surprised at this point
such a shame man. fable was one of the first few big thick old xbox game Ive ever played. so sick of this.
dont forget to try the vegan crunchy chicks
how you came to the conclusion its  going woke  is beyond me. at least based on the comments made here. more than anything though  stoking the fire of outrage over them seems a bit ridiculous. we haven t seen a single thing about the game yet and youre out here judging its entire future based on some off handed comments. its bizarre how the self proclaimed non-woke crowd jump to conclusions as fast as the woke crowd does. two sides of the same coin. different talking points  same bullshit.
ah yes lets ruin the series for a handful of people and people who dont even play games. great plan there jackazzes
the good thing is that this game is going to be on game pass day 1   so if it is woke trash I just unistalled and move on to the next game whitout paying 70 dollars
did we play the same game  fable has always allowed the players freedom of sexual expression while mocking capitalism to the point that pro capitalist actions made you more evil... when wasnt it woke
I was right to be pessimistic about this reboot   I hate that I was right .
considering we have only seen a cgI trailer for fable  I think youre worried about nothing. there are plenty of videos out there that talk great things about fable  so I have to ask  are you making a video for your audience  because this doesnt sound like a video that really has any information. most of what youre talking about is made up  as in what  you  think the game will be. modern doesnt mean w0k3
I didn t rage quit your video. watched to the end and this is your first video Ive seen. all of thatsaid  I am not sure what I expected as fable news has been non existent since the trailer dropped. and seeing the title of this video I thought maybe there was some notable release of information. instead you showed an interview with some extremely vague statements that are so open to interpretation that you added your own and mentioned numerous unrelated games or projects that have nothing to do with the game in question. there simply wasn t enough here to warrant a ten minute video on the interview you were reading from. so much so your own speculation and non related side examples were necessary to fill the time.the fact is no one knows what fable reboot will end up like. its too far out but playground games has developed some of the highest rated games from xbox in recent years. and its their technical expertise which was mostly covered in the interview alongside statements about their passion for the project. of course thats not to say that assures the game will be good. but you also covered nothing to indicate otherwise either. anyways  this is just some criticism and no intention to attack you or your opinions personally  hence why I haven t stated my own opinions on your opinions.
why am I not surprised!
escapism is terrible these days. fable while was oversold it earned its place with many. it was slated to be an mmo. but we see the constant encroachment of politics and other nonsense in out games. we see the pendulum is starting to swing back the opposite way. all these games that went woke just like the comic book industry lost so much money. fable s lore is already established needs to be fleshed out and some things fixed. but you cant wash it with this modern veneer and expect it to shine. its a fantasy world with its own politics and its own life.
can I just say this  I f@cking hate the world we live in.  holy shit man... can we please go back to the way we used to be 20 30 years ago  this generation sucks!
I like you  youre gorgeous and you cant stand woke. thats awesome
playground games made a 10 out of 10 forza game with horizon 5 which is open world. still very excited to see the world they create for fable. they are one of the best developers that microsoft has. does modern audiences mean something is woke every time  could mean making modern gameplay systems and mechanics that people are used to seeing in the modern age.
can I just say somthing there s a reason to be concerned but we know next to nothing about this game and we should wait for a story trailer  or a gameplay trailer somthing thats more hard info than just words and statements from devs
battletoads  2021  wasn t made by rare themselves. and playground games has two teams now. the forza team and an rpg team. the rpg team is literally stacked with talent. the article doesnt even relate to what youre trying to convey  with the fable reboot being too  woke.
where is that dude who leaked gta when you need him
putting  woke  in a youtube video title might make it trend in certain algorithms but I think people need to have some optimism about updating old game ips. resident evil 4 remake is getting updated for a  modern audience  in the sense of updating the control scheme so we can finally move and shoot at the same time. if a game is 20 years old its not modern in design whether it be in writing or gameplay. if people want to live in the past then they have the option to play the old versions. let people enjoy what they want to enjoy  not everyone wants to make videogames great again or were even born to remember what old games were like 20-30 years ago.
@uniqtechniq  except  they specifically state that its a reboot. not even just remake  but a reboot. and what youre talking about is mainly what a remaster would do. resident evil 4 is a remake in that it also  reimagines  the storyline. updating the graphics  the gameplay etc is what a remaster does. fable has no need to be remade or rebooted. the story  storyline  the characters  the writing etc  everything s as great as it ever was. and new generations would be happy to experience it just like we older ones. there is no need to  update old ips . old ips dont need to be  updated . the gameplay mechanics  graphics etc can be updated. but thats it. but even there  fable doesnt really need updating in that department. its not an ancient game by any means. but thats all that would have to be  updated .  if a game is 20 years old its not modern in design whether it be in writing or gameplay . writing  tf you talking about  how the hell canthe writing not be modern  its literally just under 20 years. its not ultra contemporary  as in not of these past few years  but itsure as hell is modern. if you want to obsessively live in the  current year  present  then make new fucking games and play them. leave our fucking old ass ips alone. make your own. let people enjoy what they want to enjoy. we enjoy our ips. so let us enjoy our ips. oh  and 20 years ain t that old. but you know what s great about games  you can play them in the future. if people want to know what games 20 years ago were like  they can literally just pick them up and play them. pick up fable and play it. games 20 years ago are even much easier to play and more accessible than games 40 years ago. you can literally just pick up an xbox or pc and play the damn thing. I know  magic stop obsessing over  updating  everything thats over 10 years old. are you that fucking spoilt and ageist  that you cant fathom playing and enjoying something thats 20 years old  ffs. thats sad.
@marcus  I own the original trilogy on disc and digital. they are great games  Im just excited to see something new as well. I like seeing the evolution and progression in game design and technical stuff like new game engines that can output better graphics and framerates. I never had a problem with the writing. its mostly just dry british humor. Im a south park fan so its not that I want some censored storyline or anything.
if you use the wrong pronoun  your avatar instantly grows permanent horns and a swastika tattoo. Im just glad that the protagonist is a black queer non-binary spirit kin  as that means its impossible to be racist.
the morality system in the new game is going to be based on who you are going to vote or not vote for. pick white character for ultimate corrupt.
Imean previous fable games were pretty   woke   already
the worst part of all this is that one day we wont have options to play old versions of games. we will be stuck playing the  modern version
wasn t fable always  woke
gay and interracial marriage in 2004. a number of important female characters from the outset. transgender main character in 2008. a number of lgb npcs  including major character reaver. married gay couples adopting in 2010. the entire plot of the game is a revolution with peasants against the ruling class  even if youre one of them . class warfare is big. you dont ban books  but recover them. conservatives obviously not a fanlow rent  even free!  is good  high rent is evil. death penalty is evil. sparing people is good. fable has not just been up to date with audiences  but ahead. it always has been  woke
just a question  how exactly can fable get any more  woke  than it has been since day 1  in the very first game you could play as a gay transvestite if you wanted to. Im not some leftist lib but sometimes I think people are too quick to rush to judgement on shit like this. people were saying the new God of war was gonna be all woke  but aside from race-swapping one side character  it really isn t very woke at all.
I dont get it  are they purposely trying to lose money
fable lost me with the 3rd installment of the main series. downgraded abilities. stupid plot twists and even the dumb concept of being unable to fail even the toughest challenges. something that was carried over from the previous sequel. thus making character upgrades pointless. even if the new one wasn t a woke mess I wouldn t play it if all that other crap made a return.
fable was already woke for its time.  you could be gay af in that game
fable as a series has always been kind of progressive.   but its always in a side quest or the fact that the player has always been able to be gay.  but something tells me this is going to go overboard.  fable 3 was already cringe for having socialist policies be  good  and capitalists policies be  evil .  not a good sign.
evil choices. dont learn the npc s pronoun  interupt the woman speaking  and of course not apoloigize for your racism. its gonna be great 5 out of 5 stars.
I havent bought a mocrosoft product since the 360.. no live pass  nothing!
really reaching here......  and just like yesterday  youre just desperate for content  and to just hear yourself talk...  I definitely have fear for anything going woke  but since they basically asked for this project  and being a uk based dev team  I just know they wouldn t just go woke for woke s sake...all that headline reads is that fable is being reboot and updated to today s quality compared to games from that era with a bunch of technical issues  bad aI  and hassle with old level design to minimize loading  invisible walls  etc. and you downplaying playground games  just exposes how little you know about game development.... perfect dark is the one Im more worried about.. .
tomb raider went woke  or the new one in development.
what I dont get about this is  fable always was a progressive.think about it! openly gay npcs wich you can marry  your character can be gay or bI  you can have multiple families  plenty of poc supporting characters  plenty strong female characters  gender swap potions  capable people with disabilities... it never was the most political correct game - and the first cgI trailer tells me f4 wont be either frankly - but how do you get more progressive than fable one to three  and yet she s right. thatsentence  that  for modern sensibilities  does indeed scare me. deeply.
nobody said being modern means  woke-washing  or anything. no dev has said anything that made fable special is going to change in the new one. in fact  the author of this article didn t share anything new at all. this video was just speculation based on a misleading headline and didn t actually relate to the content of the article. if I had to speculate on what modernizing the series meant  which you ve already done with no evidence   I would guess they may try to be more inclusive by having poc and lgbtq characters. keep in mind that these groups were already present in the original series  though they didn t show up very often. if you have a problem with poc and gay characters in a game with literal magic and goblins and poop humor  I think thatsays more about you than anybody else.
wokewashing  hah  I like it.
fable is a junk franchise that constantly promised the moon and delivered warmed over meatloaf. the first one  hype excluded  was pretty fun....after that...yikes. woke it up  or not  it will still be disappointing junk.
noooo
@lip  nice. thats not bad. imagine  people will be able to play the way they want just like in other games that have been released in the past 10years
as an older male gamer  I do like my lesbian romance options
okay people  let s all take a step back and really think about this. you are getting angry that a video game set in a fictional fantasy world is going to have diversity in it and thatsome how that is going to kill this series. need I remind you that the third game the one that came out before everything that comes out nowadays is  killing x s childhood   was the one that put fable on hold. the game still has its sense of humor and at most  will have customable character instead of pick your gender pokemon style. we live in world where outrage is met with outrage and the only way to stop it is to get angry that the right things instead of what video game has or hasn t.
I see that they didn t learn from saints row... welp we cant fix stupid but we can laugh at there expense  figuratively and literally
we live in an era where doing the right thing is called  being woke   so sad...
Im an atheist  but that prayer meeting sound pretty fucking good about now!
the fable series was already  woke . in 2 of the games  you could play as male or female  and both were treated equally. you could be in a hetro or homosexual relationship  and both were treated equally. you had characters of different races in the game. what exactly do you mean by  woke
you sacrificed an innocent person in a ritual  as a Christian why would you do that  sure its a video game but... does your conscience allow you to do things that are against the spirit  even in a video game  Imean sure  some games you play and are forced to kill people. that in itself is disturbing but to laugh about doing things in a game  that the israelites were cast out of Gods light for... that is incredibly disturbing. I know for certain that Jesus would never approve of that.
the fact that he was with skill-up makes it worse...
fable s been since beginning  this is a push towards more awareness. so be it  sign of the times methinks
why... why!!!! why do they have to do us like this. going woke removes a whole piece of what fable brought to the table!! so crappy  I hope that they reverse this before its too late if that is even an option.
well I dont see how much more woke you can get with the fable 2 and onward.. you could play as male and female and make it any race  black  white  asian ..ect.  you could be gay or straight you could marry the opposite sex or the same sex. you could even be a man and wear dresses in fable 2 and above.  I think you are jumping the gun on this one melonie.  also  just because a developer hasn t made one type of game doesnt mean they cant make another type of game. example guerrilla games mainly made first person shooters  killzone on the ps3...but on ps4 they did 3rd person action games like horizian.  maybe the modern audience things deals with gameplay mechanics.
you cant do this to me...
as life long fable fan I want to die now
sigh...my disappointment is immeasureable.
is it microsoft that the eu is trying to for trying to buy up many of game makers
im glad they give heads when they are making a woke version of games so I dont buy it. I will be be pissed if I buy a game and find out after and cant get refund it.
updated for modern audiences  is code for were going to ruin the fuck out it.
loved fable series  but it can also die.
did anybody actually use condoms in fable  like  ever
just get the remaster on steam. its been like a year since I bought any new like mainstream games.  huh funny that
maaaan why they keep pushing things like that
oh well  so I save money.
I had hopes that microsoft would revive the bethesda and blizzard universes  but if this is their policies going forward then Jesus Christ let them die!
well  glad to know this beforehand so I can stop caring about it.
how the hell they fuck up fable to the other games
fuck today s sensibilities.... this is about entertainment!
go woke go broke
idrc whos woke or not but its two groups of people and I bet both groups  woke  and  non  woke  would rather a game to stay as it was in its series and not stray away from it we all know what hapened to saints row ffs
original fable let you be drag  gay  ect seemed pretty woke back then.
look I already thought fable was dead so this doesnt really change anything for me.
bruh these people are something else
did they not learn with saints row  o wait they never will
wait microsoft xbox still exists  I thought that company went out of business 4 years ago.
when will these creators realize that if you go woke  you ll go broke. haven t they seen other franchises die that went woke. do game creators not know that the minority woke brigade doesnt play video games and dont watch fantasy movies. they just want to ruin the fun for the people who do.
but you gotta understand  these people think you gotta constantly be good and constantly project your message in every medium every single damn second  aka a cult no other apt word to describe it but thatsame type of people tried to say gta games inspire violence  no  if anything it did the exact opposite  because games give a release  an outlet for the violence  same with music  but they would rather find something to blame than point fingers at parents  friends  and teachers that literally ignored signs of bullying  depression  etc  or straight up abuse and neglect in some cases and just want to blame things they dont like instead of getting to the actual root cause
today s sensibilities  are precisely why most content sucks these days...
so basiclly they gonna have gay  black  and strong powerful females and insert brave and stunning story
his name is literally bootie
a chick who s against the woke hopefully she s not new aged but the fact that I saw her wearing a goku shirt as well this is to good to be true I didn t not think a girl like that existed butttttt is she worshiping a false God
save your copies of the originals!
why say youre making games for a modern audience when saying we dont like money works just as well
2 36 tomb raider talk lol
dont know what you expected from someone called matt booty
are you kidding me ! I really hope they dont do the saints row treatment. also  you are very beautiful  God bless you.
yep just playing the first and third on game pass and Im good
another one for me to pass.
lets wait and see the game first. people have nothing to do but complain about something we havent even seen yet...
how many times do we have to teach you this lesson  old man
agreed  leave stuff alone! give us a new adventure  but stop ruining the original content
we thinking about the same battle toads
sad day to destroy another good game
whelp  time to buy the original games before they get lost in the ether.
yeah I dont really much care honestly the third one although it was fun was a f     mess. first one was iconic the second one was the best. but the problem is I just I would have liked it if the tone was a little bit more serious. I was looking forward to them making another one and rebooting the series but now whatever dude just whatever
at this point itseems like they think making the game bad is a great selling point. no one wants a modern take and the people who do wont buy your shit anyways
we just gotta stop giving them money for this crap.
who are these people that make these idiotic decisions
how dare you... oh wait... yeah that battle toads  game  is shit. I got it with such excitement  played the first level with a buddy of mine for a little while to our utter disappointment. we stopped at the first boss. I uninstalled shortly after and never looked back. how dare you bring me back to those hellish memories miss mac!how dare you!
I have never heard of this game so I cant really give my opinion on it
bro how re you as microsoft going to ruin halo then fable. my childhood is dying the villain
like geralt said  fuck
the first fable was already woke  with the ability to be both trans and have same sex marriages.
booty .  childish giggling
just keep not supporting these titles and it will stop. do not give them a cent.
fabel has been dead for years
I really hope its just that one comment. it is from booty  not playground games  so it could just be marketing bs.
get woke  get broke.
no one is talking about it because its a niche game with this is going to stay niche.
well  the franchise was dead  so I guess any kind of drama is good pr for them. they couldve gone the other way you know  making a good open world rpg  good art direction  innovative tecnologies  nah son  drama is cheap. here s an idea  just give them a silent dead  they keep doing the pandering because it works  ignore them and dont buy the game  thats what they fear the most. dont give them attention just for content or clout.
nnnnnooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I wish I could say I was surprised  but Im too disappointed to even pretend.
no please God noo!!!
we are being decentezide for what us coming in the future thats why you see it in everything now commercials movies video games.
today s  sensibilities  for a small percentage of weirdos.
nooooo not fable!
so ppl are allergic to making money.
personnally  I ll never spend money on a franchise that gets mutilated for woke audiences.
how do you screw up  fable    talentless hacks that fail upwards  thats how
they often say  that is or that  didn t age well. false. its the this current generation that isn t aging well.
so I cant fart in front of peeps anymore !
huh  guess they re allergic to money.
fable!!!    what is even going on these days. do these people not learn. stop catering to these people.
fable let you use a magic potion to change your sex. wasn t that pretty woke
today s sensibilities...whose...not mine
if they actually had a  passion for the ip   they wouldn t be trying to unmake it  in order to pander to woke snowflakes.
shitkeesian is probably in charge of it like she was for saints row
sucjs pretty hard... we cant even play 2 or 3 on pc still  but we re getting a  worring  reboot...
for today sensibilities  ahahahahahahaha
playground games making something other than forza.....I wonder how its gonna go
wokerosoft.
rip kicking chickens.
oh goody! cant wait to watch this fail hard like gta did lmao
noooooooooooooo
the message
fables end.... I was playing the other games and fuck it was badass these days. gonna ruin it.
when will they learn. smh. chicken chaser!!
are you exclusively on youtube
dont care  I wont buy or watch woke games or movies and tv shows.I got enough great older games to play and will wait for better and wokeless games  movies and tv shows.
ruining another game if its not  broken dont fix it
im not surprised
I guess we re never going to get a good chicken kicking game again are we this sucks
let there be mods
no. that was pretty cool.
ofc matt booty would say that.....this is just booty
fail-ble because its going too fail due too bull.
fable 3 shoulda been better anyway
you cant censor a comedy period comedy has to be edgy or it becomes pointless....why do companies keep doing this....more money flushed down the crapper
got failo so why not feeble
what s so offensive  that you can fart on command
how does it feel t live long enough t see everything u have grown to luv get destroyed before ur very eyes
why would they do this to fable this series is inappropriate hilarious and wonderful why ruin that
esg ftw
fable is perfect the way it is. refresh the graphics and then leave it the f--k alone.
chicken kicker.
why.. just why
I dont get why studios try to cater to a crowd that isn t their primary playerbase. Imean woke twitter users are gonna complain regardless of what you do. just take the incoherent screeching from those woke bloats and just make a game as fun as it was back then. stop woke washing our favorite franchises. it didn t need inclusion back then so it doesnt need it now.
pleae dont.. it is my only favorite game.. God forgive them  because I wont
haha already doa
at least nintendo stays away from that bs
never understood why these folks cant just make a knock-off or  homage  to say fable iI and call itsomething else like fable x  and then xx   etc.leave the original names  make a new updated sensibilities game and leave the classics as is.     wonder what molyneux has to say   ha!
dead on arrival
oh no the 4 letter word
first they going make splinter cell  woke and now fable  I bet money when you get the choice to choice between a man or female  there going be another choice be trans and you already know they going made your character gay for no reason or force and look what happened to saint row  they went woke and they game died and didn t last a week and then they creator blame us and that what going happened when fable come out
u should do a review or atleast talk about that God awful bait and switch in bayonetta 3 ending dude
expect half of albion to be black and the other half to be in same sex marriages.
remember peter molyneux constantly lies
modern audience   means creative wasteland
nononononono nooooooo!
well it looks like the new fable game wont do that well then cause most shit that is made woke has boring characters and bland story and no character growth cause the cult isnt allowed to have imagination which is needed to make amazing entertainment.
fable is famous for overpromising and underdelivering  so they ll probably fail at being  modern  either way.
there s never a  danger  when it comes to video games. nothings dangerous whatsoever its a damn video game. people are so disgustingly  pathetically weak nowadays. its stomach turning
of course
if true Im going to get rid of my xbox   microsoft has been absolutely disgusting lately
kill me now I wanna die ! I tired of hearing thatsentence !
fine with me tbh  I just wont be buying it. they cantry to sell anything they want it is a free market. I will just stick with cod in the meantime. hopefully they wont f up elder scrolls if and when it actually comes.
fable I thought was woke is ink and get you could be gay I dont know
watch you choose boy or girl and then 10 minutes in youre given a sex change and its cannon that the hero is transgender. you absolutley said it right  how can you have modern sensibilities in a fantasy rpg.. Im so upset hearing this news
the first two fables were good games for different reasons.  Imean they all ready had stuff like gay marriage  Im sure you could make it gayer but how much woker can it get realistically.
you just get so tired of this. they keep making destroying these games to please a twitter mob that will never actually play them.
I dont even know why I bought a series x anymore. all my favorite movies  shows  games  comics everything are just getting hallowed out and made into an empty shell of a billboard for virtue signaling.
and now it goes broke because Im not buying it. notice how they cant make any new games  they take winners and then drown the winners in front of the fans and blame the fans for not buying. stop giving these people money and let them crash s because burn so real lovers of these passions can arise from the ashes and hopefully gatekeep
the modern audience is less than 15  of the population!! but yeah you do you!
forza horizon 5 showed their woke capabilities.. and I stopped playing it.
@iam midus  say that to the workers of mass lay offs by companies who do and watch those who do not thrive. a prime measurement of that is a lack of investors from previous ones who pulled out knowing the risky revenue wont be worth it. if you want the finest examples  try media consumption of news outlets alone and their extreme drop of numbers. try the bf games  try the cod games that only rise again when they go back to the older ways  try disney s stock  hbomax  the failures of appletv. try children s networks thatstruggle to inject  the woke gay parade stuf for underage children  i.e. blues clues  that is borderline ready to crash  try mortal kombat 11  try wolfenstein  games that are their big league games are failing. this effects the workers once again and the constant shifting of project managers that inject the same policies elsewhere after they  leave  a company and then get their salary and gather a new one when they re fired and finally fall from the face of the earth. what happened to g4  what happened to gillette  what happened to old navy  why is star wars and star trek failing  the companies lay off a ton and ask for rescue buyers
no.... please no... please not the game that made me love playing games... please for the love of God dont touch this classic......
ugh
fable wasbt out of date anyway its was very british that fits a british humour  made by vruts eith a british humour
so all you do is just read out articles
dude Im stick of this woke crap. they dont care about the fans. fable is one of my top 5 favorite series of all time. im devastated
bad alignment  some would call that  the male fantasy  lol.
I guess no one learned from saints row.
waittt we have to be guud in real life fuckkk iv been doing it all wrong then
I really hope they stay away from elder scrolls
what about pokemon  pikachu got punked for evee.
yay

honestly ive given up on aaa gaming  plenty of good non woke indie games out there.
when will entertainment realize that pandering ideology minions who aren t even going to play the game is a bad idea. especially when the themes get in the way of quality
why does everything have to be made for a modern audience I actually enjoyed the main trilogy all 3 for me I liked them all and wanted a new one  but not like this.
f not fable. 3rd favorite after mass effect and fallout.
forza horizon 5 forced you to choose pronouns  so its quite clear where the fable reboot is going.
lol fable    did they run out of good games to ruin already
I liked 3 well enough  1 was the shit back in the day  I hate 2.
melonie snack
people who aren t woke need to get into game design. too many purple haired weirdo s who take over beloved franchises. they cant make anything on their own so they destroy what others love.
I dont even like fable and Im pissed
fable was already woke wasn t it  you could same sex marriage n shit
this sucks  I really wanted a new good fable game. ive been waiting since the lost chapters  the recent remaster was nightmare fuel.
fable s been dead for a while deary  since they tried for a online shooter.
was anyone even asking for a fable reboot
words no one wants to hear when something is being adapted.
glad to hear from another Christian...
at least dad of war 2 is good.
no I dont have to be good I dont have to be anything if a person wants to be a goody 2 shoes thats up too them
oh great another beloved franchise of mine and others about to ruined for a modern audience that doesnt exists
thats fine. these people can keep pissing money away. never gonna make what you put in when you pull this crap.
off hand comment 5 secs into video..... did they make npc s stop laughing at you when you were in drag
developers  you just need to update the graphics. dont worry about the other stuff. we understand thatsexism and racism is bad. you guys can chill with that.
its failing left and right so let them keep at it.
did you expect anything different!  they need to keep that crap out of our games   honestly Im not a fable fan anyways but still this woke crap needs to go
this female is trippin.
boycott this decision no woke in games!!!
after microsoft gave me the middle finger when I was being hacked I stopped supporting anything they own screw them.I hope fable fails
no for me I ques
Im obviously aware  it just sucks that they are reviving it in this way
@melonie mac go boom  fair but then again thats the fashion of the day with any corp.  hey we haven t fucked over this franchise yet! let s do this!  flaming garbage fire announced.
@azreail13     truth
investors
what is woke
we re on the precipice of a recession and these guys want to make another game series woke  where s black and white 3
they always ruin fable because fable 2 was the best
yep. xbox was clueless with battletoads.
noo not fable
instant no-buy.
wow... now I can play fable with a steering wheel and pedal !  they dont sound too convincing when talking about the game. sensitivity should not be accounted for when doing anything creative.
no not fable... it always has been the opposite of woke... why ..
they already ruined the fable franchise eo not much is lost
so no more  chicken chaser   what would it be   non-binary follower  or something  wtf
mel dont touch the mic it hurt my ears I was wearing earbuds
nobody asked for changes to the story. nobody wants changes to the story.why are they doing this  and who is it really for
hey  guess what I wont be playing
they didn t make fable 2 for pc and fable 3 was a trainwreck.... not surprised.
hey at least japanese games aren t gonna do that crap so rip to every game franchises unless it comes from asia
why is this new generation of creators against new ideas and original content  nope lets borrow an old ip and ruin it for everyone.
just watch one of their forza monthly streams and you ll see what kind of people they have working at playground games. its always some blue haired hog hosting and a bunch of overweight neckbeards claiming they ve made great additions to the game.
fable was already pretty ghey by the third installation.
another great bites the dust. the first three are sooooo still replay-able and extremely fun.  this an extremely depressing channel. -jkjkjk. low blow. apologies. but... seriously.
get woke  go broke!!!andif its woke  its broke. and I wont buy it
not sure the definition of a modern audience. the people they cater to are such a damn small minority this cant go well
actually wait they may just mean updating the gameplay  if so then bring it on but better still be fable lol
you know .a girl with tattoos giving her opinions about topics at one time was considered  woke  .Imean where is your husband and why aren t you making him a sammich
whaddyaknow.... not even any involvement from peter molyneux and the upcoming game will still somehow suck balls.   what s larry bundy jr s reaction on this
hopefully it just means you can choose your own complexion  gender  and orientation. any more than that  just throw it out.
this is getting ridiculous the game will not do well. unless they can stick with what makes it great. the modern spin and making it for the woke audience that wont even play the game will ruin the franchise. I ll just stick with the older games for now.
why do people keep catering to a very small portion of the population  1 in ever 10 000 people relate to  woke  culture and probably 1 in ever 100 000 are gamers.
this time  instead of a good or bad alignment  it ll be a male female non-gender alignment.
aaaargh!
empty corporate language.its where woke thrives.
are they going to make joanna dark feminist by giving her daddy issues  too
never liked fable or molyneaux... btw he was always pretty woke
thats genuinelly horrible
if isn t broken dont fix it  pretty please
no please no
pass
woke means ignorant of the real world. if you ask me
these are the only games Im going to look forward to in the future.  1. starfield2. elder scrolls vi3. fallout 54. the witcher 4dragon age 4 is a maybe.  honestly da2 and inquisition were not as good as dragon age origins.  other than this  these are the only games Im looking forward to.  any other remakes and new games like this one Im not going to trust.  I will not buy a game with identity politics into it.
fable never played it. so I dont give a melonie.
that new battletoads game was complete wank !
ah this sucks I loved playing fable
I hate the witcher I am gonna go write for the witcher tv show!
she does know that xbox isn t the only gaming company doing this  sony playstation is the exact same if not worse
fantasy  its supposed to be a fantasy game. why should a fantasy story represent modern audiences  are they saying modern audiences are living in a fantasy land   well that actually makes sense  I know quite a few people living in a fantasy land. this game is going to suck
eh ..
part of the appeal of the lionhead games was political incorrectness
noooooo! my nostalgia. canthe progressives do only evil to me
is nothing  sacred! !
I got a ps2 I dont need to buy their new games
another casualty of the activism era.
the only thing that made fable so cool is that it was an action adventure game that was set in a dystopian fable universe that allowed you to do all sorts of fun stuff and the good vs evil side or it is the focal point of the story and game. this is annoying if they decide to fuck up fable like that. I was thinking that it was going to be more modernized as in graphically speaking. God I hope they dont fuck it up by adding or fucking up the story and characters. stop catering to these people and ruining our entertainment.
although I have an xbox series x  I am so fed up with microsoft s woke nonsense that I now by xbox games used just to avoid funding them. sony isn t much better. maybe a little  but not much. I prefer nintendo and pc gaming  and I wont be buying another console from either microsoft or sony. they have both lost their minds.
microtransactions started with horse armor dlc in oblivion. everybody hated it. a decade and a half later  fortnite and gta v are the biggest money makers in video game history.nobody like wokes shit. nobody. but when you tell a child he can be a gay unicorn  in 10 years  he ll buy gay fable and so will all his friends.
time to stick to the originals
just play the originals.
thats a shame  the game having a graphical update would have been cool but I guess whatever. Ive still gotta finish the original fable s dlc so Ive got that if I need a fix.edit  oh God they re going to make  evil  anything to do with conservatives   and  good  being a virtue signaling asshole. maybe I ll watch a play through after all to laugh  because you know they ll screw it up and make the  good  side evil as fuck
thats why Im team playstation
she seems annoyed! I dont intend to watch that crap sounding game. oh dear  microsoft has gone woke too.
Imay or may not have been on the test team for fable 1. what a shitshow that was.
fable was one of my favorite franchises  this is weak
um... duh
fable  any of the 3  weren t that great anyways.
fable has always been  woke
how can it be woke if it already had gay marriage mechanic
Imean  ms s studios suck ass in general anyway aside maybe playground  so the one consistently solid studio of theirs going to crap is just expected at this point no
so this is what xbox is wasting their money on. instead of fixing halo infinite they re pulling this bullshit.
fable 3 was already pretty garbage.Im not saying the sex in 1 and 2 was trend setting or anything. but in 3 it was made out to be funny. how wasn t fable woke   it was one of the first series to feature gay relationships. yes not on equal footing in 1  but it was there.
there will be transgender characters
xbox is riding the rails of wokeism and thats a reason I no longer sub to their gold and gamepass or buy games on that platform.
its been woke since its inception. there was gay marriage and condoms and moral relativism and modern diversity in the first installment.
am confused. what was woke about the fable reboot   not even seen game play to said that and what was woke about battletoads   this was a clickbait video
I never heard of this game but everything she read dont seem woke to me I thought at least might have something do with race or lgbtq community or maybe to masc women or to feminine male but only said was going  more modern is woke I guess know I guess saying modern is a woke thing know to
I heard you can decrease your morality by eating meat and  misgendering  people.
this is really bad.  xbox is hurting for 1st party titles and this is one of the titles platform holders were anticipating.  it is sad we are no longer hunting for good games but hunting for games that are less woke.  this may be the other reason why multiplayer games are popular.  people just want to play games and not be lectured.
everything that goes woke turns to shit - orange man
fable was hot trash since fable ii.
gg
microsoft has no games
fable being updated for a modern audience makes 0 sense. its a game based in the past with heavy religious themes. what are they going to do  make the righteous path the evil path now
again  making a game for people that dont and haven t ever played your game.
we ve literally seen nothing of the game so... youre reaching hard
it wasn t an ideological addition to the game back then
here s the thing until we see anything this is all a big nothingburger. it feels like the people making these videos saying  its woke  are just trying to make up there own stories instead of actually making quality content.
wtf are you talking about  fable was always woke.. it was one of the first games to push and normalise same sex relationships and marrage.
a yoooooooo
modern sensibilities    not funny  no quirky rude brit humor.  also rip joanna dark. you d think with halo tanking  microsoft would promote a fresh new sci-fI shooter in pd  but no. its going to about climate change! reeeee!
they hired the woke lead writer from horizon fw and eidos is making the game as playground cant make it ... they just used their engine and made the world
commmme onnnnn whyyyy
people cry about playstation censorship then get surprised by me mentioning xbox microsoft is uber woke. I prefer nintendo that does neither  but microsoft is way worse of big game makers
cant wait for this reboot to financially flop.
damn it. fable is the one thing I was excited about. Im so sick of this woke bullshit. this franchise is too special to me to ruin. please dont do this playground games...
medieval fantasy and modern sjw garbage.... Im not seeing how these are even supposed to fit together.
so  like saints row its going to be a crappy game with a known title on it  hmm. sounds like I wont be buying that  dmeans I can save money since no game today is worth more than  29.99
Im not getting that garbage.
and simps will still buy it  but not a single snowflake will.
ah fucking hell  man! why !fuck it  gonna buy the original fable trilogy on disc before xbox zeroes the digital trilogy copy in favor of the reboot.
so  boring and insulting and rife with microtransactions
please I want the new fable 2 not a woke shitty game ..
its never good news is it lol. I suppose good news doesnt sell as good to people but something good wouldn t hurt so I dont rope hahahaha. fucking sick of it lol.
but then again  fable was shit to begin with.
the whole thing that made fable good was the non pc dry humor....... I cant believe they are pulling this crap. xbox just cant make a good game anymore  - . halo infinite was a total sheet show..... and now the best rpg they had is going to be the same
they put pronouns in forza for God sakes.....they will ruin the franchise with woke propaganda for sure  their whole twitter is about lgbtq staff meetings......rip fable
people said the exact same thing about saints row and look how that turn out.
another corpse of a once beloved franchise  exhumed from the dirt  painted queer  and soon to be calling you a bigot for not wanting it.
oh wow this is so disappointing  more european fantasy stuff going to be wrecked. fable was such a charming franchise.
these companies have some people working in them that  are trying to push a religious like belief and  if you disagree them you are their enemy. I dont normally have a problem with religion. I know to most of you  this sounds like a crazy rant.
you haven t seen any gameplay or story line so you have no idea
nooooooooooo..not fking fable! the games were fine as they were  heroes of all genders and colours   there was no need to change the way they were..fk sake.
great leave it to the woke snowflakes to mess up the one franchise that got me into gaming
modern audience   californians.  naughty dog wonders why the last of us part 2 only sold 10 million copies.
I was watching this resident evil title with a black girl protagonist. I was so into it for 2 episodes until I realised albert wesker became black. removed it from continue watching as quick as I can.
I will sell my my series s if xbox goes on with this bullshit  luckily I never liked fabel
another one bites the dust...the worst thing you can do in the new fable is to simply create a white male character.
but to be honest  fable was born woke.  same sex marriage was available in fable 1.    noworries
straight equals bad and gay equals good...
except fable has always been  woke .gay relationships. crossdressing. trans characters. people just bitch fit over these things now.
this generation of consoles really doesnt want to succeed. xbox is woke-washing all of its flagship franchises  and nobody can get a ps5. pc master race 4 lyfe.
who cares get over it lmao
this is horrible yet another xbox exclusive that I was so hyped for and they re just going to completely destroy it because of woke agenda bullshit itsucks Im a hard-core gamer but I am getting to the point where I am ready to give up gaming at least modern gaming
question. do we have any concrete knowledge on what the game will be like  no  ok then pointless video.
you knew next gen gaming was going in a bad direction when the only flags in modern warfare 2 are pride and trans flags. in a military shooter. pathetic.
tragic  really tragic forming your opinion before we even see something.
another xbox fail
things you say are just logically incoherent
the first mission in the fable is remake is to get gender reassignment surgery and attend critical race theory class
where was the woke  I read the whole article. the author speculated  updating the title to today s standards  equals censorship of... something  I dont get it.
updated for modern audience  well I guess good hero woman and ethnic men and evil hero white man that must die only. I ll stick with what we ve got fack new fable
lol  so you will play as a fantasy character who has to repay student loans while smashing capitalism and the patriarchy.
I hate woke games
God of war reboot was  updated for a modern audience  and it f cking slaps... some people just like complaining.
fable is dead to me wont be buying this one. go woke go broke   thanks for destroying more of my childhood classic games.
give it a rest will you
fffffffffffffffuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
Imean. . .its not like fable beside 1 was even good nor it have dark theme  I say we dont lost anything that was already lost.
woke washing. woke washing everywhere. the  fix  that nobody wants to a  problem  that doesnt exist.
no no no no no no!!!!!!!!! fable is my all time favorite franchise.. please no! dude Im so done with woke culture... storytelling is supposed to challenge your morals and concepts of realism and fantasy! I hate this...
I ll pass on that garbage remake and stick to the old games...
they promised in juky last year to stick to its light hearted british monty python roots  now their saying their adapting it for the americans  modern sensibilities  this going to be a disaster
10  min video about a nothing burger of a quote. this grift is so obvious. get a real job.
going woke. what are you talking about did you even play fable 2  game was woke trash back then same goes for kotor.
Imean  the original fable already had same sex mariage  people of color etc... its part of the universe
how was fable not proper before  Im sick of these devs who keep doing this  they need to be exterminated from the community.
I hate crystal dynamics they suck
if you dont like it  dont buy it the 2004 game let you wear male female armor clothes ... and date whoever you wanted practically ... all they d need to do is just let us customize our character to be any physical look possible ... why does this kind of thing make you shout  woke  into a mic this isn t content  this is riling up a group of people  just for the views .just let the game come out  and if its not your gig  dont be toxic about it
people should know not to waste time or money on trash games
this wasn t toxic  I dont know why you are so opposed to people not liking something
where is your proof that it is going woke  hmm  there is barley at all if any new information about the game that hasn t already been shown! fable isn t going woke okay thats just your immature thinking and assumption about the game!
