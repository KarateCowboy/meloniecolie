let s hire people that hate the books and or games and a plus if they hate the fans as well. we cant lose  - netflix hire firm  probably.
the writers are the people who made fun of the nerds in high school. now they see how popular genre entertainment is and want to make it in their own image.
I feel bad for henry everytime its the creators fucking everything up for him
if you hate the source material  dont make a freaking show about it. make your own crap.
producer  did youread the books writer  a few chapters producer  did you like it writer  hate it. too much toxic masculinity.producer  have you written for a sitcom  youtube short or anything writer  yeah  and a political ad for newsom.producer  youre in charge of our writing team! bring your friends on!
gee  its almost as if buying the rights to a franchise doesnt necessarily mean you can buy the fans
out of all bastardized properties  this hurts the most. I am polish and I read the witcher saga even before lotr in my early teens. under betsheets  with a flashlight. to see it given to people not even liking it is... deeply saddening. I do however thank you and other youtubers fighting the good fight!
if you ve watched season 2  you know the writers hate the source material  vehemently.
henry cavill s performance as geralt  and the fact that he is a huge fan himself  is the only reason why I still watch the show. I dont think it is a terrible show  but I also think that it is nowhere near as good as a witcher tv show should be.
I still remember when some reporter who was interviewing henry cavill about the first witcher series calling the fans of the franchise toxic because they didn t like how certain aspects and parts of the show was done.henry defended the fans.henry is probably the only good thing about the tv show. the rest is just a show about inclusion and diversity and not really about the witcher
ugh. save us henry cavill! youre our only hope!
it makes the so much sense that the team hated that geralt was the main character by the amount of yinnefer worship and how lackluster s2 was.
Imay not watch season 3 but  henry cavill is great playing the character
when will they realize that fan investment only occurs when they give audiences shows and films that respect the lore and characters they ve come to love
taking a property and then acting like youre above it with an adaptation is the height of hubris.
well that explains why they took so many liberties with the material in general and race swapped half of the cast. and why geralt almost feels like a side character in his own story... dont get me wrong  I still very much enjoyed the series but it could have been so much better if people who actually cared ran the show. henry cavill seems like one of the only true fans on board.
I love the witcher lore. I tried to watch season one and couldn t get passed episode four. the games stuck more to the books and you can feel while playing it that it was made by people that gave a damn. the soundtrack for skellige was so spellbinding I d leave geralt standing around by the cliffs overlooking the sea while the music played. my father and I laughed and cried while I played the game then terrified what was going to happen to cirI depending on how you played the game which effects the outcome. it became my favorite game and still is because it left a memory of a time I spent with my father. the show  no. one of my favorite characters is regis and I dread what the show will do to him. especially after what they did to eskel
on behalf of everyone who s been watching the show and have been paying attention  we noticed. now they re just coming out and admitting itso itsaves us some time but changes nothing.
I think most true witcher fans knew that this was the case right from the start with the total disregard for the lore  bad costumes  terrible cg and woke casting like we saw with rings of power. henry cavill is the only person in this show who is actually passionate about and cares about the source material
yay! a sponsor. yes!!!
you deserve plenty of sponsors for having a head that doesnt bend the knee to the woke mob and a heart thatseeks to honor God. get it  girl!
gz for the sponsor  the start of success
hooray  another sponsor! you deserve lots more. excellent vod by the way. I watched the first two seasons of the witcher but I dont think I ll watch season 3. ppl shouldn t be allowed to work on something unless they are a fan of it  thats my opinion because of all the woke crap that has been ruining all of the franchises we love. there may be hope yet for x-men 97.
1  lauren must go2  cancel series3  sell ip to hbo4  reboot
so its a scam to take money from people and give nothing  interesting.
a little ot to your pinned comment  but I think someone is hacking your channel as I received a remark after my comment saying that I had won a package and to follow a link. comment reported.
kudos for not bending a knee to the woke mob and kissing the ring of the bull instead. exactly what the world needs more of.
@uncle drayton  Ive been seeing a lot of such replys to me as well  from several videos. its become quite a problem recently for a lot of folks itseems.
not just netflix. this attitude is alive and well at disney  amazon  and many others...
yeah  seriously  look at halo and such.  unfortunately I kinda liked the halo show  but I never played halo and really couldn t be offended if I wanted to be.  the witcher is a whole different story.  they need to hire people that are passionate about the series or similar  or its doomed  and thats for anything.
@teeebs  seriously  does anyone know why the rings of power show runners were hired  are they bezos  nephews or something
thats probably why the show never really appealed to me. I could just feel something wasn t right.
if anything goes wrong just blame it on incels.
thats not even netflix.  thats almost all entertainment these days
@rambleon07  friends of jj abrams
@rambleon07  jar jar abrams made a phone call to amazon  because for some inexplicable reason he s king maker in hollywood nowadays...
y all do realize that he s not saying netflix is the only company that does this right  he s just staying on topic. learn the freakin difference.
I hope that you get this reply  melonie because I got this reply from this spamming  congratulations I won something  troll that is pretending to be you in my comment reply  and I just wanted to give you a heads up. thanks and keep up the great work on the channel.
@tg5455  thats not what a troll is.
one of those scam things replied to me  saying to text you lol. Ima block and report it though
umm... you got a fake profile saying you won on my post.
@chris valen  yea I just had that one  said I need to text her.. it used her same.pic and everything
@uncle drayton  its been happening to every channel I commented yesterday its nobody s fault except the one who tracks on the content we comment   coz I commented on inforgraphics channel too and I got similar giveaway thingy
@bruce  well  this person has been spamming me over and over again with this fake  Ive won a prize.  b.s. for a while and its starting to feel like Ive been getting trolled for some weird reason.
@spadesilver 90  I know that its not melonie s fault or jeremy jahns s fault or others  fault  its a little bit of youtube google s fault for not handling the problem. Im sure that it would get fixed soon but its starting to get annoying by seeing the same thing on my feed over and over again.
@tg5455  its also not spam. its a scam. phishing.
@bruce  it is a scam but its also spamming as well when this person had been to other channels by doing the same tactic.
they hate us....and I l v hearing you and call me chato just fucking say it out loud.  bless you nerds
@jason davis  yes this happened to me as well got  with little party hat and kazoo emoji... sent an email as well for me to to go to telegram and asked for  100 in paypal for a ps5 said it had to ship form country to country that is why it is expensive  but the even  100... sounded so odd... just thought everyone should know there is a scammer that is trying to use your good name and picture to scam other fans...
basically thunder cats roar where the creator hated the original  but that didn t last long
I doubt that netflix is mostly responsible for the hiring of  the witcher  staff because when you have things like  arcane  and  castlevania  its hard believe it a company wide thing.
hollywood in general
this plan z cant possibly fail!  - maniacal showrunners probably
@dknotts30  the did eskel dirty
I have been trying to understand how these people get hired and why they accept the job involving the thing they hate. or at least even if you hate it why dont they just still try to do a good job and move on when the opportunity arises. there have been plenty of times where I had to do parts of my job that I didn t like but I still did the best I could at it. thats what normal people do why cant they
let s hire people who hate the entertainment medium who has beaten the crap out of us  out of jealousy  instead of learning from what that medium has done and why people like it. surely gamers will stop playing games and love movies more now!
@teeebs  everyone in the entertainment mediums competing with games. because movies cant beat the value of 1000 hours of entertainment for one payment of 46.95   and that pisses them off.
@dknotts30  I liked the halo show as well and that is probably also because I never played the video game. the fans are very upset as far as I know. and as a fan of tolkiens work  the books and other source material taken into account  you can imagine how I feel about rings of power. so... I can very much understand fan frustration whenever the original content of a story or a franchise is butchered.
for real why hire people that dont like the subject material. recipe for disaster.
comics  sci-fI fantasy movies and shows  video games produced very successful brands  based on proven formulas thatserved the demographics that have supported those franchises. the writers and executives of the hollywood elite  by contrast  have always despised these products  and their fans  but because these are the projects that make mass market money  so they have been trying to convert them into their own woke image. the train basically wrecks itself given this monkey wrench scenario.
they took a page out of disney s book
how you can laugh at a book written by a master writer like as and thing youre able to do better job than him. its beyond me  especially when you see what a giant pile of shit the script for the series is.
well... at least it might be an  interesting  perspective
@rambleon07  jj abrams made a phone call for them plus the writer for the new star wars movie is also a friend of jj aka bad robot jj has tons of connections his biggest is speilberg who basically snaps his fingers and its done speilberg also had his hand in halo look it up jj has his hands in lotr halo dc star wars star trek jj has a 300 mil with warner right now for over 3 years and has produced nothing because he wanted to race swap constantine and superman jj is a poser using nerd culture to build his production company
100
every film studio and streaming service these days. there are only a few sparks of hope these days.
and this is why I am damn near close to canceling my netflix  hulu  disney  and hbo max subscription  actually Imight keep hbo max cause they have yet to do me injustice with game of thrones despite the final season being a joke  at least hotd is good and the last of us it coming in .. hopefully they dont do the last of us part 2
@treyday  jj is still getting jobs because he s a small hat. just like that failure disney just hired for sw.
now hiring  writers. must have purple hair and pronouns in bio. no other requirements.
I d agree with everything apart from the idea that this is exclusive to netflix. multiverse of madness  provides  us with wanda maximoff following the events of wandavision. oddly enough sam raimI  director of the film  didn t bother watching any of wandavision so the two events connect about as well as a fork and an electrical plug outlet.
its actually the drama crowd freaks
@bored alchemist  glee occupied government
@hopefully everafter  are you a brookie typing on the keyboard as well
yeah  they didn t care about sf f until it became cool  then they assumed they were entitled to be in charge and kick the uncool nerds out.
the writers are the people who made fun of the nerds in high school such people seldom make it past supermarket check out jobs or sports teams in my experience.
I blame the cringe big bang theory sitcom from the late 2000s for attracting all of the normie fake geeks to geeky hobbies and fandoms like video game  anime manga  tolkien s books and movies  and many others.
exactly! I got bullied in school for liking lotr and reading fantasy in general. Im 26 now and my sister still hates on me just because I love reading and all the nerd stuff. I also do reenactment and fantasy cosplay with my boyfriend.. man this woman laughs about us every single time. I dont care about that  its just dumb.but really most people that hated on me back than are now  fans  of fantasy..I really enjoy how they try to lecture us and teach us about our life long hobbies. and in the same moment they try to lecture you about specific lore in lotr they say tolkien was racist and all of his work needs to be rewritten..
@andrew haddow  I think there s a certain stereotype regarding the definition of nerds and video games  because I promise you there are plenty of nerds in hollywood. but because hollywood was conceived from the idea of building a star in there own way  in order to separate a star from the average person they needed to look like someone that would have lots of money. over in the uk the queen is looked at as a profile figure  but here in america we didn t have that until the film industry really started taking off by the mid 1940 s. over time people took that image as a way to identify a celebrity  but what that also created were legions of obsessed fans and weirdos looking to get close. today hollywood is filled with creeps  weirdos  and pedophiles  the paparazzImakes up a huge chunk  but thats all caused from 60 years of film being a thing. the other half represents the music industry  there in a similar fashion  but the gaming industry was its own thing. japan had there own ideas about entertainment  for them it was about how to take the concept of a game and turn into something you can control with a joystick. but im not surprised who hollywood thinks a nerd is  because there the one s who created the false illusion of a star. if you dont look this way or that way  you dont belong here. acting should be about talent  but its never been about that. you cantake up acting classes or go somewhere to get some experience  but the real secret they ll never say is  you making it as an actor is determined by how you look. so if they think you look like a nerd  these are the roles you might get to play if your lucky  but you might not like the role much. jason biggs is a really good actor and funny guy  but unfortunately they poked fun at him in america pie. thats also why they chose the red head to be his love interest  because God forbid a hot model brunette is off limits.
@andrew haddow  yeah watch what dumb   dumber did to got  best series of all time. down the fucking drain.
...and said nerds dont pay their delusions today  hence the failing of all of their movies and series.who s the outcasts now
how
@mala  cavil is a witcher fan and loves the game. there s a possibility that he may be forced to  because of a contract  to do scenes that are an antithesis to events in the game series he likes.
@mala  have you seen snyder s interpretation of superman  its utter garbage.
@palladiamors  synder batman kill and use gun
superman and the witcher. the corporations really seems to have a problem with henry.
exactly  he s winning and losing at the same time.
@palladiamors  he s a great superman. he s not Christopher reeve and thats fine. why does every superman have to be like him  superman returns tried that and that movie bombed
@silvis lim  his arc was that he was losing his mind  overcome with rage  and started to not care if he killed people until he realized he was going to far in the martha scene. he was becoming joe chill.
yes indeed
they want to piggyback on other works for publicity while not even liking those works. a lot of these people dont even have the creativity to make anything of their own either. but for some reason they think they are hot shit.
@stephen pardue  yes indeed
problem is... they cant. too talentless.
@lovise ricachii  indeed
evil cannot create only destroy.
@trevor thornley  just went did batman lose his cool  if he lose it then he s not batman  . its not like Im say synder jl is bad movie  just not the batman and superman the dc fan love  dont get me wrong  I like how he direct his version of justice league  but that two characters is not that character we love  he change the motivation and the action of batman and superman so much that without the outfit I barely recognise that two character  and if batman really decide he want to kill superman he wont stop because their mom has same name  if he decide thatsuperman is someone that he willing to drop his code for  then that reason is just too plain for batman  and superman in his version also have one problem  superman is a symbol of hope and a people of tomorrow  but his version of superman just dont let people feel hope and didn t inspire people to try to become a better person  its a man thatstruggle his own identity and its not a friend to people on earth  its more like a messiah on earth  Im not say its bad  but his superman is not the superman that people love  his superman feel like justice Lord or the superman from injustice before turn evil  which not love by fan  but as a story its something I looking for  so Imay love the story but not love this character  just think like this  I like the story of injustice but I dont like thatsuperman  so in the synder jl he manage to bring the most unlikeable version of that two character in his story  so Imay like the story but I really cant like that two character  maybe this explanation suit more well  its not like I dont like henry as superman  but I dont like this version of superman  I hope that he play the superman that more like the earth-1 superman  not that earth-52 superman  ask any fan of dc compare these two version  I believe many will hope he play the version of earth-1 but this versionedit  cause its about henry so I forget about batman  I just really dont like the idea that batman ran over people in the bat mobile and using gun  I only saw once in the comic that he using gun in early stage  and that a no no for batman in every other version of him  and if he willing to kill them how in the hell thatsynder jl gonna go to injustice storyline  that will just go to justice Lord storyline  which we know thatstory suck  cause if the two of them teaming up with okay to kill people  its just so boring  superman can basically kill anyone he want  and batman can just stay behind giving order or maintain order  either version is not the batman we want  isn t it edit 2  sorry for bad english  not my first language
@palladiamors  yup  saw it and liked it.
@phillych3zst3ak  I agree that he most likely would stay true to the source material. this is an unfortune situation for him.
@silvis lim  this isn t the superman we know yet and batman isn t the batman we know anymore. you gotta change these characters up a bit every once in awhile. snyder was doing a deconstruction of these heroes. if you want to watch Christopher reeves superman then go watch. this version isn t him.
@silvis lim  also he cant be every where at once.
@trevor thornley  nah lmao those are just in name only. if the characters have nothing in common with the source material then they really aren t the characters. there are certain things that you cant change otherwise its no longer that character. batman dosen t kill and superman dosen t hate being superman. superman needs to stop being treated as Jesus  he s supposed to be the most human even though he s an alien. changing all that and still trying to call the characters superman and batman would be like making goku a highscooler that only cares about getting laid.
@trevor thornley  yeah I know character change over time  but there is good change and bad change  Im curious what they gonna do with henry superman  but still didn t change the fact that this isn t the version that fans love  henry can be a much loved version of superman thats what made me sad  and I did think he suitsuperman well  Im just say the superman synder want isn t fans favorite  Im not say that he act bad  Im just saying that earth-52 superman which I thought synder superman almost same with it  a very depression superman  isn t the fan favorite  and the batman of synder  I really cant think which version of bruce wayne it is  maybe thomas wayne that become batman  is not the bruce wayne we knew  the batman fans love has a code  and that why people love him  a man with code  thats mean he may have devil inside but he suppress it  synder superman and batman just not fans favorite  but fans still happy to see jl in live action  at least I am   and Im gonna say it againsry for bad grammar  I know there are many mistake in my english
@bullet x wound  yeah  that just dont feel right
@silvis lim  a lot of fans love this version.
@mala  because he s awesome and the great properties he s involved with are trash.
@trevor thornley  nobody saying he s a bad superman. they re saying the directing in the writing is bad.
@trevor thornley  yea. it was stupid and we did t like it. you enjoy what you want though.
@trevor thornley  like I say asks them to compare it  without comparison of course they will like it  but with the comparison I believe majority will agree henry deserve a better superman
@jesse  ok
@mala  agreed and while cavil may have some push  he cant guarantee that the writers will stay true to the source material when he truly wants to.
@phillych3zst3ak  exactly. but he is one of those actors I always wish a lot of success  because he seems to be legit.
he s a fan of the stuff he work on so he would make as perfect as he could
henry must have read the books multiple times  it is really clear when you hear him talk about the witcher. he is a little nerd by heart. we ll never know if he actually enjoys the show  cause people say everything a contract requires them to say.
and now he left the show
@bullet x wound  yeah. the irony with what snyder did was he clearly didn t know what to do with superman because the character is hard to do. that whole virtuous and moral characteristics thatsuperman is known for is hard for someone like snyder because he doubles down on a character s flaw. so teasing him to turn bad or making him question himself is the easy way out story-wise. but that crap had been too played out with the likes of irredeemable  invincible  the boys  and even injustice. its not unique anymore.making a good story about superman and maintaining his morality is the better challenge now but no one seems capable of executing it.
@mistermastermind  it would be beautiful if someone actually manages it. I never understood why people wrote off superman clark kent as a character. he s not as cool as batman or he s too op or too much of a boy scout. but thats what always made him cool to me. he doesnt have to be good  he doesnt have to care  he doesnt have to help anyone  he s not motivated by guilt or shame. he just wants to be a good person who does the right thing. he s supposed to be the one who believes in humanity more than it does itself. hope is a beautiful thing
@sI   ana    if I have a chance  I would take that challenge. I have an idea for it. but the likelihood of that chance  0 .and yeah  youre right. that is what makes superman cool being the meek character despite being too powerful. I guess thats why his character worked a lot more on tv than in the movies. movies require him to have a grand epic conflict because of his powers while tv allows us to see what he does with small and big conflicts across several episodes. but I can still say  there is a way of making good movies with a proper superman  and not a  what if he becomes evil  trope .Im quite enjoying rewatching lois   clark. I also remember enjoying the first seasons of smallville. and Ive only seen around 4 episodes of superman   lois. they might not be perfect but they do get modern superman and the ethos behind him. for example  giving superman a son who is on the spectrum is a challenge that his powers cannot solve. thats the human side of it. clark cannot solve everything using his powers. though Im really not updated with the show anymore so I dont know how its doing now but the idea is there.and oh  superman the animated series is very cool.
I just read the first book and geralt is a nice guy. he s not toxic at all  never watched the show .
@ghostofasiren  he s a straight white male with multiple female conquests  and he doesnt carry a man bag or drive a prius. what do you mean he s not toxic
@nemesis juggernaut  Ive just read the first book and he only sleeps with one woman in it. not sure how the other stuff would be relevant  lol.
@ghostofasiren  are you joking  or are you seriously not sure where the other stuff is coming from
@nemesis juggernaut   he s a straight white male lol corpse white.
itsucks because there are a number of badass female characters in the books who all get their moments  but most of book 1 is about geralt going on solo adventures and world building so they crunched the timeline to rush yennefer and triss on screen. geralt doesnt meet yen or triss until the second and third books respectively.
@ghostofasiren  they hate geralt because geralt is us  he doesnt care about politics  doesnt see people by their gender  status  religion or anything like that. to him everyone is equal and nobody is a victim  cant have that.
the witcher s books are really progressive overall. they frame stuff mostly in a realistic and fair manner  showing the problems with every view under the sun  even exposing the hypocrisies of the main characters  but its made clear that the humans greatly abuse the elder races and that we re meant to be on their side  apart from the extremists  who are put in a bad light and ridiculed . thats what fucks me up -- they didn t need to make that universe  woke   it already is in many ways  depending on how you define the word. there are tons of strong and independent female characters  geralt himself is a minority that gets shat on all the time  there s the struggle between races and how the dominant humans marginalize the others  etc. any competent progressive writer would see that and realize there was no need to change anything  just ride the wave of the great words sapkowskI put on paper -- its all there. why these companies hire tapeworms to write for them is something I ll never know...
@ghostofasiren  we ll always have the books. they cant take the original story from us.also  I need to say this. yen in the books was such a strong intelligent beautiful woman. yen on screen  was weak and frail. I also did not feel the chemistry that drips off every page in the book series  in the netflix version.
@stylis  geralt met yen in the first book  but not triss.
@emmanuel araujo  I really liked the stuff between the elves and humans. made me think of elfquest.
@stylis  its the code nowadays  no matter how strong or badass these female characters are  the moment they show some femininity or attraction to guys they re immediately problematic in the eyes of those weirdos.
indeed
ah  probably for 1 to 2 movies. you have to realize that not everyone dives into all the articles... normies usually have to go to 1 or 2 stinkers before they are disillusioned.
I haven t read the books but Imight have to check it out
@dark highwayman  the books are good
you polish are lovely people. always welcome in my home of england. dzien dobry !
the audiobooks are great. there are some rad witcher graphic novels too. season 2 of the show went off the rails compared to the books.
I supposedly have some polish blood from a zillion yrs ago. I ll have to check it out.
they may take our franchises but they will never take our love! - william wallace  probablyseriously though  the books will always be there  whatever they do with the ip. I often look at my Lord of the rings books and feel like I need to apologize that I watched an episode of rings of power.
now that cd project getting an esg score system  it is going get worse and worse and worse
yup  great books with a lot of depth these people are apparently unable to comprehend. and they just film totally random scenes using the names of great characters of the great story not even bothering to find decent actors.
read the books and played through the game... and I honestly cant even remember what happened in season two. lol. I need a recap.
I dont even know why people watched it or plan on watching s3. these people hate them yet they re paying them
I just remember feeling like wow  they really sidelined henry in his own damn show. by the time they got to the part with the wild hunt im like I have no freakin clue whats going on bc weve had to spend so much time with yennifer  francesca  and the elf chick
I think the season 1 was bad enough to me!
I only watched two episodes and decided I was finish with it  itseemed like a whole different thing from the first season.
Ive only seen season one.
@allennium falcon   one of my best summers was spent with my friends travelling through your country  good memories! cheers!
@mateusz tokarski  I have had a few polish neighbours  and they would always bring me some good alcohol or cakes. and they all worked hard ! respect
@mateusz tokarski  old polish series is actually great  despite the low budget. they really cared about the story. dunno if it could be found in english  I watched it in russian   as for nightmare of the wolf - it is kinda disgusting and stupid in terms of characters  motivation if you ask me  vesemir behaves like a real jerk there
@mateusz tokarski  and  ebrovskI s face when he needs to show geralt being sad or just sorry about something is priceless
I do however thank you and other youtubers fighting the good fight! the good fight in what sense if you think a few randos on youtube matters one whit vs the masses who neither read the books nor played the games you are deeply delusional.my dad loves the witcher because he loves the series - he s not a gamer or a reader so its all down to the series.Im a reader myelf  and I used to be a gamer  but I never got round to the witcher and I like the series plenty.its not nearly so cut and dry as these youtube channels make it out to be. fan  is not a term exclusive to readers of comics novels or players of games.there are problems I can see with the witcher series of course  certainly since s2 where geralt takes too much of a background role to other characters - but in general it is still a very enjoyable series to watch.unlike amazon s wheel of time - despite coming in cold to the story it was so bad that I was actively seeking out the first novel only 4 episodes in.wot not only plays badly as an adaptation  it is just terrible in general as a series
I love the books. I already read them 3 times since 2019.  Im german and I do recognize a lot of the creatures and mythology. I was always interested in folklore and especially east european folklore is soo special and creepy  I love it. it also has a lot in common with german folklore.
for what its worth  I think the awitcher is one of the best fantasy series ever written. I was irate at how badly they butchered the plot line and characters from  the blood of elves  in season 2 of that terrible show. also  cd projekt red s witcher iiImay be the best game Ive played. it was outstanding from the beginning through the dlc.
Ive been in the same place last season. though now  I dont know if I have the desire - after rop and sw butcheries  I just dont think I can watch any more bastardisation  especially of fantasy.
series 1 had some good stuff  which kept me going through the less good  series 2 had two good episodes  the rest was just trash. cannot be bothered with series 3.
henry is an arguable geralt but he s the only worthy part in this disgusting show
@                yenefer can be good. some of the cast have had their moments. henry is good.
@st ellI   friends  they turned yennefer into a feminazI weak-sauce version of got s melisandre. she s blatantly vile at times and they pass it off as a  necessary evil ...  aka  stunning   brave
I remember that  and the media went after henry hard for that too.
now he left. sad. why not just recast the writers
@patrick sampollo  he s going all in for superman. he s a die hard dedicated nerd. if one project offers you better work place with actually competent writers why wouldn t you make the switch
he caved to the writers in season 2. he ll cave more.
@noneya bidness  this is news to me.  how did be cave
@amuro0079  he let season 2 happen the way it did is what I think the commenter means. but if he held strong and refused to act unless they fixed their shit  it may not have happened. which is unrealistic  its his job. but hes been actively talking about leaving cause he hates how they are treating the source material because hes a true fan
@amuro0079
@noneya bidness  they caved to him actually.
@noneya bidness  unfortunately henry is likely contractually obligated to play geralt. from all indications itseems like he s fighting these directors quite a bit  the scene where roach died was originally supposed to be comic relief but cavill refused to do it . honestly I dont understand why they aren t letting him be more involved in the creative process. hollywood hates making money for some reason.
@w1llki11edsnake07  make no mistake  he caved to them. a few hollow victories didn t keep season 2 from sucking.
@noneya bidness  agreed  just because dude is a fan of the third game doesnt mean that he has best intrest of the show in mind.
@urim tummim  in interviews he s talked about being a huge fan of the books   the games. he fought really hard to get the role. he s just an actor though he doesnt have the power to overrule showrunners  directors    writers.
@that nobody guy  exactly. did people forget that acting was a job  it ain t as simple as  oh just leave . henry isn t the type of actor with  fuck you  money. I swear this side of the spectrum is getting just as ignorant and miserable as the woke.
@blacklives orblackvotes  rotflmao. sure  snowflake.
@noneya bidness  and in those few scenes where he got his way were the best parts.
@that nobody guy  yeah I dont get why ppl are pushing him.. look at the got actors lol they all admitted to hating the shit out of the last season and they had no control over it.
he s just the actor  he has a very limited pull on the running of the show.if he was an exec producer or investor producer it would be a different thing.
@jordo majima   but if he held strong and refused to act unless they fixed their shit  it may not have happened. which is unrealistic  its his job  its his contract.his job is a bit less defined  his contract is very much defined and refusal to budge would be grounds for dismissal - possibly even cancelling out whatever he might have been owed so far in wages.
@mountain nomad vfx  true. but also he has the power because the most beloved part of the show is henry cavill. sure dismiss him and see how the fans react  even the ones who like the show. I still think he holds more cards. but again I completely understand why he wouldnt do that. and itsounds like he might be on his way out if he doesnt get what he wants. but thats just me being optimistic. season 1 was pretty bad  and season 2 was just abyssmal.
@urim tummim  well I wouldnt put the blame just on him   you cant expect 1 guy surrounded by monkes to fix everything do you   dont be so quick to judge him if you havent been in such situation.
@                well you either participate in the project that you like or you quit it if it doesnt align with your ideas. if he s obliged to stay due to contract then he s dumber than he looks and rewarding is not his forte.
aaaand he s gone
@grintock  holy crap he actually did. as sad as it is  I respect him even more now.
@urim tummim  and hes gone lol he was done with their shit
@noneya bidness  actually  he just quit.
@360 lootgoon  Im actually impressed more by him throwing away money  to uphold integrity.
holy shit  I see it know.
@youdontknowme  right !
missing the point is the thing of the day  apparently... show writers clinging to their favourite character and not seeing their flaws.
season 2 was fine. yes. the yennifer worship is ott.
@youdontknowme   now
Im up in the air as well. I just started reading the third witcher book for the first time and Im loving itso far. just bought myself two of the video games so I can give them a try.
@heather verhagen  the first witcher game is a bit too old at this point but 2 and 3 are amazing.
dude I feel horrible bc season 2 legit killed any interest I had in this show. the first episode was great.........bc it was a geralt focussed story.........I dont watch the effing witcher to watch yennifer  francesca  and whateer the elf chicks name was .
Im honestly torn because I love henry as geralt but hate what they did in season 2  season 1 was just alright  but season 2.. I could ve forgiven a lot of things  but killing eskel  I drew the line there  it didn t just break the lore of the witcher  itshattered it. all because they  wanted a death to mean something and killing off a throwaway witcher no one knows wouldn t have the same impact
its his last season now liam hemsworth is taking over for season 4
when we vote them out with our wallets and stop consuming their bs
somebody needs to play them some aretha franklin. r-e-s-p-e-c-t!
oh you mean entertainment  yeah that doesnt exist anymore these days  its a dying rare species thats even more rare then the dodo. today its all politics and hating fans.... until hollywood runs out of money. wb seemed to have ran out of money
disney took a battering ram to frozen with its atrocious sequel  maltreated my favorite character from anything and made her sing a song to pretend that that can encourage her to do something thatshe d never have the ability to do  fix a major problem when all her loved ones are gone   tarnished a franchise with a great soundtrack in previous installments by bringing in terrible songs  took the elemnts concet of avatar but somehow made it boring  had elsa s dead mother encourage her to kill herself  had elsa turn around with the  do you wanna build a snowman   which from anna meant she was asking her sister to send time with her  but from elsa it is now a sla in the face saying she does not want anna to be near her and is eprfectly okay with them not seeing each other much  and then on top of tall that trash  it pretends that everything anna did int he first movie was for bleedin  arendelle  a lace that based on how the second movie went should have been destroyed. let stuid arendelle go  it is not as imortant as elsa and anna being together as loving sisters  that is what the frnachise is built on  not them separating. all of anna s actions in the first movie are for elsa. at least from the point of her sister s powers being revealed. and yes  she didn t want to see her kingdom blanketed in snow when it was summertime  but like  thats not why she goes to see elsa to ut a sto to it  its becasue she wants her sister back  she wants elsa to know she accetsher and her ice owers  but jennifer lee chose to tarnish the proeprty she brought into the world  not giving it proper resspect.there are ways the script could ve been fixed  one of them being samantha  who would have to be an actual person  not just some wind being that cant be seen  would be elsa s friend int he beginning and anna is worried abouther sister spending mroe time with this new girl than her  then when elsa cant fight anymore because elsa is bsically dead and she thinks kirstoff is dating some other girl and olaf has disappeared  samantha comes along and sees anna in despair  figures out what needs to be done  leads the goldem to demolish the bridge  then elsa gives samantha her blessing to become queen  and anna lives in a hut with elsa in the woods and thier sisterhood and love for each other conintues. itstill doesnt fix the boring elemnts of the movie  but it does solve the tranishing of the franchise.and if you want further proof that jennifer lee has no respect for the proeprty thatshe herself wrote the scrrenlay for  here is another piece of evidence. olaf s frozen adventure  which has elsa sing thatshe will never give anna up  ws written by a fan of the franchise. someone who loves it and could give it proepr care and understands why frozen is poular int he first lace.hjennifer lee doesnt get what makes frozen a thing  and her vanity is likely fueled by the fact that non-frozen fans fell in love with the second movie  eole who hate the first one or claimed to and now pretend to like it becasue of the sequel. and like  maybe rings of power and she hulk and every proerty that disrespects hte fandom thinks they can get away with a frozen sequel  the fans of the original will be disgusted with what they put out into the world  but a new fan contigent will arise.
imagine how shitty harry potter movies would be with the same attitude.
if they re so above it why not make a standalone series but no they butcher known names since its an easier sale.
to be fair  if you ve read the books  geralt spends a lot of time not really doing anything in them
@michael c  yes  I have read the books. though I still have the last one to read  haven t had a chance.
@cd5sircoupe  same  haven t finished the last one. I watched the series up until they started turning girls into eels. that was the final straw  and it completely demoralized me from completing the book series.
@vincent l  Im no super expert on the books  but in general the first season felt pretty good in adapting events from the short stories. like oh I remember this event  etc... but Im sure if I were to read the source and then immediately watch the show afterwards I d probably find some more egregious issues. its been a few years since Ive read them. and I get the sense that they were being adapted in a broader general sense rather than try to 1 1 anything  obviously  since thats pretty much unheard of when adapting written work to film. but still  would ve liked a little more care   respect from the people responsible here.perfect example  jackson s lotr trilogy compared to amazon s rop trainwreck.
@cd5sircoupe  I think its unfair to dismiss criticism just because of the supposed impracticality of adapting 1 1. -now  I realize that isn t what youre doing  necessarily  but that is a frequently used argument to defend the alterations. for the sake of the argument - just because there are certain limitations  it doesnt provide a blank check to trample all over the source material and condescend legitimate criticism.
@cd5sircoupe  consider my comment about turning girls into eels. this was during the never written chronicles of yennefer s time as a student of aretuza. aretuza  a school of hogwarts level importance in the lore  had in their student body several daughters of noblemen. even the girls who never went on to great things in magic would still end up set for life with such a resume. you suppose those same nobles just sat back after learning their daughters had been transmuted into living batteries for the school they paid a small fortune to attend
@vincent l  youre right  that wasn t what I was doing. my point was that if I had come fresh off of reading the source  I would have found more issues with the series. since it wasn t at the forefront of my mind  the show felt like it adapted the material well enough in a broad sense despite many glaring problems I was still able to find.that being said  my example with lotr perfectly illustrates my point. jackson s trilogy isn t a 1 1 adaptation either  taking certain liberties   shuffling things around  but it was done with care   respect for the original works  which I had run through at the time the movies were coming out . now rings of power on the other hand is just self-insertion ideological fan fiction thatshits on tolkein. I feel like the witcher show lands somewhere in the middle of thatspectrum  probably a little closer to the good end.
@cd5sircoupe  pal  I could keep going on how badly they missed the mark on witcher. jackson s trilogy was a labor of love. when one of the writers on witcher comes out and says the writers room was full of disrespect and mockery of the source material  I think its safe to say it is just as bad as rop.
right there with you. far too many liberties taken  and not enough care for the really important story beats.
thanks for your comments ..you ve been selected to claim a package congratulations!!! lucky winner.
hopefully netflix says  just shut up and follow the source material . cavill is a huge fan of the game and makes sure on set that they are accurate lol.  he talks about it quite a bit in one of the interviews.
with all due respect  craig mazin  the guy who is show running the last of us is a massive  massive videogame fan and an even bigger last of us fan. years before it was even a possibility that he would be allowed to work on it he was banging on about how much he loved it. whether the show will be good  that remains to be seen  but if it is terrible nobody is going to be more upset about it than craig mazin. I am really happy you made this video  did not know about this article and it explains a lot. thanks
absolutely loves the books  as well as the audio books read be peter kenny. that dude is incredible. if you haven t checked those out please do! and the games are easily some of my favorites.
they hate expectations. they want to write what they want and to hang the skin of a popular property over it without respecting the source material or the people who love it.
its probably a prerequisite at this point for these studios.
imagine if someone who loved and played the resident evil series could make an actual film
so very glad I didn t watch the show out of sheer habit
they hate fans because we call out their crap and criticize the often unnecessary changes to content that they make. we  limit  their writing  so we re the enemy.
respect the fans and respect the series yes! I hope they approach xmen  97 this way also henry is a legend!
we love the books so much we re going to completely ignore them and tell our own story.
how can it be. the books are amazing and the games - especially witcher 3 - is a masterpiece.
they obviously didn t read the books and definitely didn t play the games. all  amazing. I even read the books based on the netflix series  and  even those are better than the actual show!  anyone who actually reads books will know that  any movie or show version is much less detailed and has a lot of missing compared to the original books.
friend of mine works adjacent to the industry and told me that most new creative teams have almost 0 interest in geek culture or plainly hate ir and rather be working on other projects more of their taste  but know that geek franchises are the current cash cow.so they hate work on fantasy-scI fi-superhero stuff but know that its the most lucrative work that they can get for now.
lol  the zoom in on your big eyes . awesome you got a sponsor  so cool. I hate it when people dont know anything about the project they are getting involved in. yes! give us what we want. for the love of goodness. loved the video  love ya melonie. great job. and looking forward to the next.
Im still shocked they even knew enough about the source material to say they hated it.
you actually read andrzej very well! good work on that. also now it makes sense why the witcher netflix series is such a flaming garbage compared to the amazing games and books. let s hope the third season will finally get good  because so far itsucked. people who dont like or respect the original source should never be allowed near any sort of work related to it.
as someone who doesnt play games. I do find your take on the industry very refreshing even though Imay not know the company or the individual game. I like the thought process.
I want to say something witty and smartass but melonie is so damn wholesome and likeable. the fandom menace is a better place with her in it.
its sad that its all about money. time and time again you can see these passion projects of artists  writers  and directors always deliver. the love for the ip shows through.
hate the books... hate the game... hate the fans... dude! we re gonna make so much money on this! so  the project fails  and they lose money... well- it cant be anything that we did! it must be the fans fault...  let us remind ourselves again  what is einsteins definition of insanity    insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.  that kinda sounds like hollywood as a whole in a nutshell. thank you  again  melonie. loved the video as usual.
how did that worked out dude he cares more about playing geralt than having a good show he couldve stand against all this bullshit
@tudor leonte  thats not how it works. if he works in hollywood  wants to play superman  how good does it look if he s fighting with writers and directors for future projects thats just one example. he cant just fight everyone he disagrees with.
@cmdr lostjayhawk  indeed. its like these people dont get how it works
@cmdr lostjayhawk  writers can be replaced but icons like him cant if the star disagrees with something because its not accurate to the lore you sit down and fucking listen to see if he she is right.
thanks for your comments ..you ve been selected to claim a package congratulations!!! lucky winner..
I wish henry cavill would be anounced as the next james bond. he would be the best james bond that we ve seen in a long time. he is completely underutilized. and its great that he will play superman again.
haha I tried my best  I was so overwhelmed trying to pronounce it
I dont even think its about the money to them.  just ego and pride.  if it was about money  they d play itsafe and try to please the fans.  you please the fans  you get the money
@linklex7  it may be pride and ego for the sjw writers and directors but for the corporate brass  its always about money. I guarantee jeff bezos had final say on the rings of power dumpster fire but the writers convinced him that this is what the people want. so he signed off on a billion thinking he was gonna see it all back in toys  funko  and critical praise for how progressive the show is. just think of the toll this took on his pride and ego  putting out one of the biggest failures of the year.
@linklex7  yeah like I feel the same. like taking too many liberties and insulting the fans made many shows fail. like live action cowboy bebop.
exactly why live action cowboy bebop failed.
real talkthey have never like us ever.they have hated us from day one  but they do love our money very much  but at some point and time they thought they had a new fan base like themselves  so they purged all the good creators  and those that loved their work  then told us without saying it outright  that our money is no longer good here.
I loved the first two short story books and the prequel season of storms.  the series had ups and downs  particularly to the middle and the end.  geralt was just dead weight towards the end and his crew  who all died in rapid succession in one chapter during lady of the lake  really carried the story.  then geralt and yen die suddenly at the end and are carried off into the sunset by a unicorn.  and cirI eats rats.Ive never watched the netflix series because I knew they would netflix it.  it really sucks because Ive seen the interviews with henry and he really is a fan of the books and games.  I ll be sticking with said books and games myself.
- joker   its not about the money  its about sending a message - netflix   we control the money  we control the narrative
well even before this revelation I could have told you for certain that they didn t like the source material  given how savagely they butchered it in the show.
wow that really surprises me ...the way they showed the original characters so much love and respect  was just so stunning and brave.
you clarified 100  in the beginning as to why I wont watch the fallout tv show
this is not a surprise to me that you have these people in the industry who dont care about the source material. I do believe that they should hire people who love it than just taking the paycheck.
I could tell by how diverse the show is
tapped out after season 1 - it was obvious they hated the source material when henry cavill had to tell them how to write it
I hope demayo is a trend-setter. being a fan of the source material should be prerequisite to penning  or show-running  an adaptation
you cantell melonie has gain some experience promoting ads during her time at gamespot. that was a very professional ad break.
I just started finally reading the books. I felt alot of similarities between this and lotr imo.
well then we should all thank our lucky stars  that henry cavill absolutely loves the books and the games and keeps the writers on point.
its legacy media and self insert clap trap. Ive been saying it for a while. back in the day if you wanted to leave your mark on the world you d donate money towards a new childrens hospital  invent something or have you own kids. they re colonizing hobbies and rewriting already established fandoms and ip s. I would have thought people would be insulted to get the used hand me down ip s instead of getting real original diverse characters and stories. there s plenty of african  malaysian and italian stories and folk tales for example that could be used. but they re lazy  they want to take credit without doing the work. and I think they secretly like pissing off the original fans.
just discovered your channel!! keep up the great work!! cheers!!
Im so thankful for all these people for saving me money not supporting any of their bs products
in the uk doctor who was run by a writer and starred an actress who actively hated the show but used it to make woke points to the audience  and as soon as those folk left everyone s excited again. if you try and  update it for a modern audience  youre killing off your franchise.
the witcher is one of my absolute favourite franchises and netflix almost woked it to crap..
there was a time when something like this would make me think the producer might have bad blood  but after the last several yrs its more like... duh!  this is good though  like finally... getvrid ofcthe poison and stop hiring toxic ppl that just want to war with fandom.. oh well
really enjoyed your thoughts and comments young lady. thanks for offering a glimmer of hope to us. great job.
and thats why my wallet stays closed. and when that imaginary audience never shows up and the money runs out they still wont get mine
yeah  every time I think about geralt s life and death I end up with  unforgiven  by metallica stuck in my head.
thanks for your comments ..you ve been selected to claim a package congratulations!!! lucky winner.

I dont wanna watch any of the new shows at all. they all seem to hate the lore and setting and just want the built in fanbase
@dark highwayman  yeah I almost exclusively watch things that are a minimum of 20 years old at this point.
@dark highwayman  agreed  if I normally end up watching something its because its a  story of its own.
yes they did woke it to death. henry as geralt is the only good thing about it
Im convinced that the superhero shows in our country suffer from the same kind of writers and producers people who are not fans of the characters and therefore could not  for the life of them  find a way to make their stories compelling.
it was inevitable and the writers antipathy for the source material definitely came through in the first season of the show. cavill was the only redeeming feature of the show  Im glad he portrayed geralt. I just hope cdpr doesnt ruin the next witcher game.
henry caville is a huge fan so he s singlehandedly carrying it all on his back lol
when youreally think about it  the entire scenario in a strange way borders on hilarious.
its so easy to be laidback about fans  true fans  not the screaming rage monsters.  but no  hollywood  creatives  wakes up and choose violence.  dont abuse drugs y all.
if I wrote a successful book  comic  created a video game whatever and hollywood wanted to adapt it I d be like not without my ok  contract agreements not to change shit etc so if they do I sue them.
I dont know who demayo is but I love what he says.  this is absolutely what we need going forward  entertainment being entertaining.  especially where fantasy and escapism are concerned.  and I ll leave it to the learned professors to sum it up  fantasy is escapist  and that is its glory. ... if we value the freedom of mind and soul  if we re partisans of liberty  then its our plain duty to escape  and to take as many people with us as we can!  j.r.r. tolkien I never fully understood it until my friend professor tolkien asked me the very simple question   what class of men would you expect to be most preoccupied with  and hostile to  the idea of escape   and gave me the obvious answer  jailers.  c.s. lewis. we need more creatives who are there to escape with us and fewer who want to lock us into the jails of of modern thought.
only episode 1 of season 2 felt like the books or the games  I guess this article kind of explains that.
when I saw students of aretuza being turned into magic eel batteries like something out of avatar  I knew the source material was a distant thought to the writers.
what made me angrier about the whole witcher thing is I had hope. I followed that writer producer chick on twitter  back when I had twitter  and  she kept saying how she was traveling throughout poland and getting accustomed to the culture and that the series was going to follow the books faithfully. then everything went downhill once the cast was picked  geralt and dandelion actors are the only good ones in my opinion . I gave the first season a shot. I was devastated they ruined my all time favorite book and game series. and the fact she purposely made the nilfgaardian armor look like penises to  stick it to the patriarchy  . just saw fallout is getting an amazon series now. prepare for more disappointment.
I know the actor henry cavill is one to read through the source material and will try to keep to the source material hopefully there are enough people to keep to it and make it as close as possible and not go woke.
the depths of ignorance in regard to entertainment is beyond palpable. it feels like a millstone they re trying to tie around our necks.
its sad that these fantasy series aren t getting made by people who respect and love the source material. as fans  we ve been waiting forever for these shows  hoping thatsome day they would get adapted  and if these shows aren t well received then the likelyhood of getting another crack at it in the future is slim to none.. which is depressing.
I feel bad that henry is such a talented nerd actor with common sense and leading man looks who is forced to put up with absolute fucking clowns in order to get anything done. seriously  the fact that he s not already playing james bond  is proof enough that hollywood deserves to be quarantined. you couldn t ask for a better candidate than him.
henry was the saving grace I honestly thought I was going to binge s2 in one natt like s1 but it was so slow ahd confusing
what s ironic is that henry cavill loves the witcher games and when he learned of the book series he jumped into it.
you ve got to love how  creatives  take something beloved by the people  completely change it  and then call us begets for not loving it. I hate hollywood more than I hate pretty much anything else.
the only people who should be allowed to write an adaption for books or games should be huge fans that know the main story without looking at their phones.
henry cavill is a fan of the the witcher 3. he s a pc gamer and he builds his own pc gaming rigs. he talked about playing the witcher 3 and how he loved the game. I dont know if he played the first two games but I think he got into the the witcher 3 for the first time.
apparently the same happened at 343 they said they  purposely  hired people who hated halo  like what
sapkowskI wanted to make money and didn t care. he consider games and movies being another medium and not canon. he also said he is too lazy for supervising.needless to say sapkowskI isn t really greedy. his son was sick  he needed money for his cure. son died last year...
agreed  my friend
this!!!
@melonie mac go boom  and dont even get me started on the fact that the old regime at wb was trying to kick him for standing up for the fans.
I hate what 343 did to halo. my halo will always be bungies games and thats it.
I haven t read the books  partially because I dont speak polish  but I loved the games.  the series was...  decent.  it wasn t everything I wanted but it was still acceptable.  after seeing his portrayal  I cannot imagine anyone else in the role of geralt  though.  cavill was phenomenal.  I could forgive some of the liberties they took  but one I cannot forgive is their make-up department.  geralt s scars are an absolute necessity  and the triss merigold race swap would have been bad enough if they didn t also change her trademark fiery red hair.  I dont think yennefer was portrayed very well  but that could be more of a failure on her actress to not grasp her true mindset.  would have liked more of a focus on geralt  but she and dandelion  not calling him anything else and you cant make me  played well off each other.
I watched season one of the witch and haven t read the books or played the games. I honestly have no idea what is going on in the show. but I do like henry in it
the writers of this show ruined everything. im gonna rip my hair out. how can anyone be so bad at their job
to get the show even written  she hired three writers that didn t even know the source material and stated that but they had similar mindset as to her. this was not news.this is why it is important to follow the production.
anybody familiar with the books obviously knew this already from watching the very first episode.
huge witcher fan. couldn t watch the netflix show. now I know why.
I am not thatsurprised to learn about this. but I was shocked that he went and said it out loud. thats refreshing truth.
if something is a masterpiece you dont mess with it.
they wanna hijack everything we like  this sums it up.
they already came out and said that the only reason they even came close to the source material was because of henry cavill is a hard-core witcher fan.
Im a failed writer and Im getting my revenge by writing woke content and the viewers will hate everyone else but me! muahahahaha-reeee !    dead inside writer
I dont think witcher will let them through. Im stoked for a new season
someone on twitter was getting upset thatso many people were saying they weren t going to watch the next season. they wanted the female characters to get their flowers too and said  why cant you guys watch the show for them this is embarrassing.  like we really needed to remind people what the title of the show is called
melonie is really right here when she states that it is easy for new viewers to say a show is good while fans of the original material are upset because of the changes made there. I experienced this with the halo show. I never ever played the halo video game and I liked the show for what it is. but I see and understand the frustration of the fans of the video game there  and they were upset for sure.
I hope henry lays the smackdown on these hacks trying to hijack this beloved property. respect the author and the fandom  dammit!
one thing hollywood dose not understand when adapting something is that you have to be loyal to the source material because that is what made it work.  now there are times when little changes can be done. for example harry snapping the elder wand rather than declaring he would be undefeated was a good changesecond. if these works are good might it be good to understand what made them good after all most people were not geeks nor heard of the source material before now.
at least we have henry cavill and thats never changing.
actually with the witcher I was ok with the series not being based that much around the books or the games   since the games are not loyal to the books and they are a great medium   also the witcher lore supports the idea of parallel universes so I treated each medium as its own version of the story .its annoying though that a lot of cinema elites are hating on fans of the franchises and that they try   and sadly succed   to butcher the ip on the altar of virtue signaling and wokeism .
itsucks. on one side you ve got writers who hate us and will do anything to destroy the mythology  but then on the other side you get a movie like black adam that followed the source material but couldn t help themselves by throwing in too much all at once. its like  can we please get something in the middle  some kind of happy medium
thank God henry was there to at least push back enough to make the show likeable.
but not in the witcher anymore xd he left to go all in for superman.
this age like milk real quick
the problem with entertainment is the writers. they are shitting up everything
henry cavill is a nerd and he is the reason why the series is actually good. he has a lot of demands that he wants met due to his love of the source material
when they target things the fans like only to bring it down it ends up looking mean-spirited. which it may often be.
the writers and show runners dont have to like the source material. but they should understand why it is liked. nicholas meyer was not star trek fan  but made it a point to find out why it was popular and created the best star trek movie.
I am jack s total lack of surprise. their hate for the source material really shows in the final product
I like the witcher books quite a bit...but I could see how  if you were trying to adapt them to screen  you might be frustrated with them...in reality there s very little action in them  practically no  monster hunting   and geralt honestly spends at least 2 books traveling in the wrong direction while very slowly searching for cirI and not doing much at all  lol
no desire to replay the last of us  thats insane. the relationship between joel and ellie  the story  and the creepy clickers make this a game I easily could replay over and over
when they made geralt a loser  no best friend  replaced dandelion   no reputation  pays for sex and gave his most famous accomplishment  strega  to triss  blackenmild  I noped out of season one and never looked back
hey  mel. was really fun to see you on revenge of the cis yesterday.
when are we getting melonie mac as lara croft
we really need to talk about the peripheral...!!!  its v close to the book so far  stylistic and visual stuff is over to taste
I keep saying they need to fire all these people taking on projects that they dont like and then try to hijack it for their own purposes. do use them as disposable soap boxes to preach their ideology and agenda  and then throw them away when they re done and move onto the next property
I grew up with beau demayo  we were friends elementary through high school. life happens and we all slowly go our own way  blew my mind when I heard his name. he was a huge nerd  not an insult  we nerded out a lot  and looked nothing like what he does today  dude bulked up big time.
if you have to hire new gen staff. there are a pool of talent that trained themselves inspired and brought up through the original works for each fandom. you dont have to go hire schooled activists that have an agenda to vandalise everything because they hate everything.
I was suprised that in season 2 they got it right with female dwarves with beards.
honestly  I have no idea how it works with writers in hollywood  but isn t having motivated writers that at least have interest in the projects theme somewhat standard perhaps not... but that mentality might be a reason for so many bad series nowadays...  and even worse  remakes . especially when it comes to games.
played the game searched the lore and I love the show.
not surprising when caville himself was correcting them on book game lore.
she was saying that even before s1 aired. I had my problems with s1 but I never watched s2.
melonie  I would love for you to cover the esg nonsense cdpr is planning to incorperate into their games. im curious to hear your thoughts on it.I wont put the link but search- cd projekt   deep dive  approach to esg  en pl
I know but that would require effort on their part
replay  ...I couldn t get through it the first time.
@bastian  how  I could maybe see if you originally played it on the ps3.
@amayville77  didn t find it interesting I guess. it didn t pull me in. its cool that you like it though. sorry to be a downer  Imight be a little grumpy today. lol
thank you! I had a blast
@rambleon07  well  in the end there isn t anything bad in being progressive or simply having another opinion  but how you act on that opinion. the bigger problem is always the  radical  part. and the thing is  if a writer isn t really a fan of said genre  thats fine.but I would really ask myself why did I took the job then  even if in an individual case its about money - fine. but even then a writer would still be better off by participating in a positive way  maybe even get new experience from it... but the choice to actively  undermine  a projects success by opposing it  because of a personal dislike  that is the moment you should definitely quit.
Im ok having an open forum as a writing staff  as in hiring people that are either were not fans before or just casual fans while having some leads that are fans as the lore master but actively hiring people that hate the source material or franchise of what they are adapting or creating just is terrible and short sighted  intended or not those people will sabotage the show. we have seen this recently too many times of late.
cavill carried the show the way an op tank carried the raid... I heard scuttlebutt that cavill had to fight for some ground in a few creative decisions in regards to geralt s character when some of the writers know fuck all.   Ive met some decent writers directors producers in my brief stint in indie filming and I can easily say that the more hot-headed  in-your-face newer writers directors producers will always try to bring in their personal soapbox in their work regardless of the damn source material in the name of woke-ism and  inclusion .   makes me sometimes want to smack them around with the heaviest gaffing rig on the set.
hey this is popular.  lets buy it  and then put this pre-existing script in it  win win.  says everyone with an adaptation or a re-boot in mind
you only realize this now  I already knew from when they cast henry as geralt
henry cavill loved the source material  he was a huge witcher fan. Im sure that news helped him call it quits as the witcher and put his focus back on superman.
wait  what is this feeling  is it hope
honestly not surprised. cause if the woke feminist style protagonists have been anything to go by  as well as what Ive seen being shilled out by netflix  some of them prolly didn t like yennifer s story of constant struggle and failure and want her to be more of a  yas queen  type story instead
its sad really since henry cavill seems to really have enjoyed the books. he even played the games.
Im convinced this is the case for wheel of time.
this is why we gatekeep like the unseen elder.
as someone who likes the witcher games and I have read a few of the books and I liked season 1 and that animated thing they did. should I watch season 2
I think what youre seeing is service companies that hate those they serve.
read all 8 of the witcher books  I loved henry cavills portrayal as geralt  but I am done with the show. season 2 was a disaster. they ruined yennefers character  they ruined cahirs character  they ruined vesemirs character  the show is a joke.
wow!!!melonie.thats not surprising.now it all makes sense why for no reason those basterds killed off roach.wow!!interesting to learn of this.well I ll just have to see the trailer and watch reviews before watching the next season on netflix thats for sure.
someone finally admits what us fans have known...shocker
after reading the books Imust say that the series can only be better and should improve on the source material where it is appropriate.the author spent a lot of pages to content and characters hat was not related to the main story  and started doing this in the third book.the story is ended just like a saga also.
I love how you spell  andrzej  and I gotta admit  it was almost perfect  just letter j on the end was wrong
writers directors should actively point out the people who say  the source is crap  cuz obviously those people are not gonna help you make a good product. yes they are in a work enviorement that is more like a snake pit but good movies and shows is what in the end drives someone s career not what a  woke  coworker thinks.
this explains pretty much the entire second season... not a very good fanfiction after the first episode.
in other news some new openings just popped up for writers on the witcher
imo  the writing staff is the one piece that absolutely needs to be staffed with people who are familiar with and like the property.
@rambleon07  well it depends. for example I rather have someone talented in writing for the screen and isn t that familiar with the property but will willing to learn of it then someone that is too familiar and is not that good of a writer. regardless my original example is a objectively better compromise to just hiring people that hate the property they are working on and want to  modernize  or  change  it.
@nostalgiatrip1  why not hire people who are passionate about the property and talented. you dont have to limit yourself to the purely nepotism pool of  talent.
no surprise! anyone that watched season one was scratching their head wondering whether the show was about yennifer or siri. little or no explanation about geralt s backstory  his powers     nothing
I didn t need a confirmation from them to know that. their statements about the adaptation  years before it aired  already screamed contempt and cynicism. they just wanted the cash coming from the license s popularity  just like 99  of videogame s adaptations   I know they adapted the books but they were targeting the huge games  fanbase
who would have guessed  this is happening to every big franchise. lotr  star wars  marvel  witcher. the writer all happen to hate the fans and not like the topic they have been given. its either these writers made it their life long goal to ruin a fanbase they didn t like  or these companies choose the absolute worst people for the job.
yeah if I was dumb enough to be a disney or netflix investor I would be pissed.its like they are purposely failing and making me lose my money.its bizzare.
ok new video. Im here for this
imagine people who love the books working on this series.. it would be on the same level as got season 1-5. Im talking about the quality.
at least cavil himself likes it and from what I heard sticks up for it if they try to do stuff that doesnt make sense
women and nerds when henry cavel calls on us for help we are going to be there.
you said  andrzej  correctly  sapkowskI is the easy part.
at first I wasn t sure what the video is about  but then I realized its about the tv show thatshould ve been called  the yennefer .
the yennefer swap to my race is what woke me up to hollywood s bs. she looks like me but I loved the original long before they casted that box ticker and I will always prefer the original. I am no fan of cavill either but he s the only reason ppl watch that garbage show. so glad my money has never paid the cheques of ppl who hate me and think I am dense.
as someone who really loved the witcher 3  its just sad that we probably wont get an honest to the source material witcher series in our lifetime. why there not billionaires children who are gamers and want a show for us
this is basically why I refuse to watch any movie or series thats based on games  even if those games are based on books. itseems they never live up to expectations. I haven t read the books  but I did play the games  so I honestly also dont know how true they are to the source material.
I am convinced that they are saying this to fan-bate. and we fall for this stuff way too often. including this video.
if they hate it then they shouldn t touch it! we want the source! be loyal to the book!
henry cavill does though and that is all that matters
I have played the original tomb raider games on ps1. the reboot trilogy games are superior to the originals. the uncharted gameplay mixed with the semi-open world survival aspect is brilliant imo. and the story is pretty good in which itshows lara croft s origin  and how she becomes the confident hbic like the original tomb raider  at the end of the 3rd game.
this was fairly obvious seeing the witcher show after reading the books they are supposedly based on
uhh thats weird. guess they just needed a job. only read the first book  but it was a great read!
okay the games I expect them to shit on because they think gaming and gamers are some bug enemy to he destroyed.but the books the books are beautiful  I loved the last wish and must have read it like 15 times.
I am beyond shocked I said that right
I like henry  he seems like one of the few people in  hollywood that isn t a nut. and Im sure most of the good things in thatshow are due to his influence. but ultimately he s just one piece of the puzzle and there s only so much he can do by himself.
@brandonheat243  I agree
he can only do so much y all act like he is some sort of saviour in this disaster.
@alicia norayan  right! these clowns really love their precious cavill  its sad man. xd
youread andrzej well. should give a try for the rest
imagine making seven seasons of something you hate. that goes beyond merely malicious. if youre malicious you simply put it out of its misery and move on. but to torture and despoil it for seven seasons  thats sadism.
what breaks my heart is poor henry. much like superman  hes a walking encyclopedia for this ip bc he takes his stuff as an actor and a fan very seriously  and they sideline him in his own show and force stupid crap that doesnt belong. like with the death of roach  they wanted to make a joke and henry flat out refused out of respect for the character of geralt and what hed actually be feeling.
witcher tv show writer shows what happens when a writer likes what they are working on.
is be going to be babysitting or fighting monsters this season  stay tuned for adventures in babysitting.
lol I just commented on another video about this. they didn t want to base it of the book or the game but use a popular name.
the witcher was a great show. never played the game or knew anything about it before the show  but wished it would have continued to have more seasons.
they should first look at where their audience resides the most at first  which Im sure is the game  build on that for awhile  and then proceed with the stories from the books!  I personally think this is where most of these guys fail when trying to bring us these adaptations.
no kidding! if the writers liked the source material  they wouldn t want to alter it drastically.  s2 of the witcher was unwatchable and totally mangled the books. but we ve seen the same thing happen to star trek  Lord of the rings  etc.
let me go and take a wild guess here but im pretty sure these writers have purple hair
I haven t played any of the games but I am very familiar with pedro pascal and his track record. at what point is hollywood going to permanently fire these people
ofc they do  but they like making homosexual scenes in every show  so cant wait to see geralt turning out to be gay
surprising how the only good thing about it was henry cavill who actually enjoyed the story and games.
why would they hate the source material  its what s getting them their fricking pay cheques. are they the same writers who wrote for rings of power
really hate netflix woke-washing every fandom I love.
lets just say I got into books as I couldn t wait for season 3 to come out  I read 30 pages of  the last wish  and my opinion of this show fell down hard  after I finished 1st book my show rating went from 9.5 to 1   0.5 for henry portraying geralt and 0.5 for freya allan  which are only 2 things I like about show   yeah thatshow is dead for me and only way to somewhat redeem it is to have geralt riding knocker scene done down to the last every little book detail and Imight give show rating of 1.5. just read the books it is all I can say  1st book was enough to kill any hype for the show for me and there are 7 more books after that 1st one each better than last.
I love the games. love all of them. I dont like the books though. so I get it.
and how are these shill writers still have jobs.....im just shocked.  no wonder the halo tv show was terrible. no one has respect for the original material.
I ll bet their hatred of the lore was surpassed by their hatred for henry cavill
Im torn on the last of us. on one hand I hated the games. on the other hand it looked like a full third of the show was filmed in my neighborhood and around my building. and another chunk in the town where I grew up.
I know  right
also  most writers are readers  most gamers are not.  so again  connect with the gamers and then the readers  especially with the witcher series.
ikr they re forcing that in nearly every series movie now
now if they only acted on it.
I think the reason its good is because henry cavill is a real fan and true gigachad nerd.
its almost without exception that every product out of hollywood and its related venues hate the source material of anything they re dealing with.
to be accurate - these are words of one former writer who has been fired because of introducing unhealthy atmosphere or similar bad shit.
good thing is geralt is a huge fan of both and moonlights as the world s most powerful superhero.
its a large company  obviously not everyone likes it. people expect new shows each week  the only way that happens is getting large companies to write them.
I cant with this crap anymore. Im gunna make my own thing!
if they hate the sorce meteral then do something fully new then dont do a show or film built on a pre esisting ip.if your developing something based on a preesistang ip its important to have a majority lvl of accuracy but you can still find room to do your own thing like yenifer from the show was orignal of her origion and I really love the consept of her using magic to rip her body appart at a cost to make her self beutyful
they better not have white skin  - writers
stop. hiring. activists.
the only reason these actors have their roles and jobs is thanks to the games and the books  but it was the games that took it to the worldwide arena.  I love henry caville though! genuinely a true nerd!
okay. Im in. x-men 97  never heard of it but Im gonna watch it. haven t watched rings of power despite having amazon prime and being a huge Lord of the rings fan. haven t watched resident evil despite having neflix and being a huge resident evil fan. but I will subscribe to disney  just to watch x-men 97 despite being only a casual fan of the x-men.
we hate the books  we noticed
no wonder there was a drop in writing quality in the witcher season 2
amazon does too
honestly loved the show  season 2 better than season 1  as it had a coherent beginning  middle and end twist. season 1 was all over the place  and only makes sense if you take the time to piece it together in your head  and even then it felt as though season 1 was missing a lot to be desirable  the costumes for one were not as good as in season 2. the books are pretty good  the game is fun  but man to hate them is a bit much.
I cant understand why hollywood keeps hiring people that hate the source material and fans. there s a reason anime is getting more popular  they adapt the source material and turns out people like the source material
well they wouldn t want to give the job to anyone who was a fan and has a passion for wanting to work on it.  that would be crazy
multiverse of madness  provides  us with wanda maximoff following the events of wandavision. oddly enough sam raimI  director of the film  didn t bother watching any of wandavision so the two events connect about as well as a fork and an electrical plug outlet. hoorayy for premium content and connectivity
the funny thing is how the gaming industry is worth more and makes more money than the cinematic shows or tv shows etc. so they can call us nerds etc but they suck.
exactly! they got fired!
eh  I d have to have more details about  what they meant by  unhealthy atmosphere . could be true  or could be a smear-job because this writer didn t go with their idea of a healthy work environment   i.e.  he liked the source material and called out the hypocrisy of hating mocking the source material of a show youre trying to make money off of.
and by  unhealthy atmosphere  you mean he didn t go along with the radical agenda.
@username  well  I d say - not necessarily  d but let s be aware  that the producers have to kinda level up the story to broader audience. thats why  I guess  they have introduced the baba yaga plot  in season 2 to add more action and greater stake in place of many conversations  intelligent dialouges and relationships building known from the blood of elves book. but e.g. s02e01 was pretty accurate with the books  that was nice. still I think that they managed to keep the books  spirit.
@anjie   unhealthy atmosphere  is super vague. to me  itsounds like bullshit.I want a source on op s claim  because I couldn t find anything about demayo being fired.
@gwyn  Lord of cinder   I didn t fact-check the claim  because I dont really care  lol  but I have heard of actors producers  etc. being fired for creating an  unhealthy environment . usually its just a slick way of trying to ruin that person s reputation because they didn t pretend to support the new  popular thing  tm  . so yeah  probably bs.
witcher 3 is considered the best game ever by a lot of people  the show  specifically season 2 as it fucks up more then season 1  is trash tier writing  its like a 2 10 and cavill gets one of those points himself... its ok to like shitty shows but you cnt say they are good
@ygkemosabi  I can say it is good  but I can agree it is not the best. I like what I like  hated season 1 as the writing was drab and chaotic  just a game of thrones rip-off. however the moment the writers attack fans of the games and books...it pisses me off.
@alicia norayan  lol name calling  the lowest form of communication  I still enjoy the games and the books  I enjoy what I enjoy  and you do the same. if you want to hate  you are the lowest form of humanity. the one thing we can agree on I am sure  is that hollywood needs to start paying attention to fans  but if the fans are divided  then hollywood wins. so have a good day.
@creatv  they said the same thing in my reply. weirdos for sure who likely couldn t debate anything without screeching.
@themightygoat  it is strange  people who do not read anything but the surface level. oh well.
@themightygoat  lol the debates happened when the show came out but fyI they always go the same way... short version.I give x amount  easily over 10  reason why something is not good or shouldnt have happened the way it did and then the other person tries to strawman something I didnt say or just says its good because they like it...repeat for all of marvel  rings of power  most things that get the  woke  label ect ect its all the same... some casts are more likable then others so it confuses people but the writings all the same quality...
fire them if they dont want to work for their salary
how many takes did you do for that commercial
I liked the first season a lot. basically because cavill and yennefer may be the hottest woman on the planet. I didn t like the second season as much. I suppose if the creators are just half arsing it then this would probably be a good reason why.
herny already said if the writer go off track like they did in season 2 and do their own thing he not coming back for the next season cause the writer also said she didn t like the book to so dont be surprised it be announced that henry ain t coming b  see more
them hating source material and fans is a symptom of the problem. the showbiz is highly nepotistic with a group with an agenda. getting something good every once in a while is just something slipping through the cracks.
we all know there are only two people keeping the netflix witcher series from being terrible is henry and tomasz.  btw beau was never a producer  he was a former writer who was an assistant producer when everyone else who couldn t fill the position was busy   all of the producers are still there  for both the first season  second and upcoming third.also beau is a bit of a hypocrite because he wrote the narrative for episode 3 and episode 10  from season 1 and 2 respectively.  considering he was working alongside the other writers  he was in a position to influence their writing and choices  to encourage them to be true to the books  to care about the fans  no  he did none of that  instead did nothing  was a career focused sycophantic yes man clique conformer and when he was booted out of the group  decided to go cry to journalists as revenge.  this is just manipulative media deliberately designed to create outrage for revenge.
not surprising.  this is always the case when movies  shows based on established i.p. s under-perform.
henry cavill needs to visit those folks and give them proper gaming pc s.
hImelonie just wanted  for your incredible chanel.
so weird to hire writers that hate the source material  but itseems to be common.
at this point. I say   let them fail. sony has already figure it out with spider-man. dc   wb is working on it. and from the sound of it demayo gets it.I will miss seeing new stories of my favorite heroes on the screen. but  in my eyes its far better to have a what if story in my own head   where han solo never escaped the carbonite .  or a story   will han solo gets pulled in a time warp.   then to have another star wars  the rise skywalker or whatever story they wish to rewrite.dc   wb   ea   sony   ect. wish to have my fandom. their the ones am going to put above rest while making my choices.
thats obvious  when you see what paramount did to halo
yeah  the last two halo games were also created by people who hated the original series  ce  2  odst  3  reach kevin smith hated he-mannoelle stephenson hated she-raIm noticing a trend.
if you dislike a book  write your own. but they hate because they cant  they re not good enough and  try to  bore us with their crap. indeed  lucky we have cavill!but for me its simple. if I get any suspicion with any movie serie they screw up  I dont watch. its the only power we got  dont watch their crap.
you know melonie is mad when she says  crap  she s livid! Im just teasing lmao and I find it actually a very good thing you try not to cuss you do better then me and Im trying to stop cursing
itshould be legally mandatory that any hell-a-weirdo member prove they are a fan of whatever ip before they cantake part in the process  at least writers  producers  directors  and actors.
okay  im gonna watch the show to support there attitude  if they are pro fan
netflix needs other writers ..... they have to be fans of the books and games .
yes  I know. you dont need to remind me  mel
like imagine doing a game of thrones shows and not even liking the book or even harry potter.
thank you
I bet you the writers who said they hated the books and games never actually played or read any of them.
this is how all of hollywood feels about fans.  look at what they did to star wars  star trek  dr who and the avengers.  they have completely destroyed all those franchises because they think they know better then the fan base
congrats on the new sponsor! love to see more support for melonie  because she s absolutely fantastic. I did enjoy season 1  but that was before I listened to the audiobooks. season 2 was a huge step down.  it was at least still better than wheel of prime.melonie on almost everything lately that isn t anime   I got bored
is  is this what hope feels like
as for books. I can partly understand them. first few are good but last two are rather bad. best part are short stories. witcher saga by andrzej sakowskI is a mixed bag. but if they disliked all of it that is a problem.
I love the witcher so much that Im going to watch literally anything they put out. but I do wish they would stop disrespecting the source material.
and thats why they are a former witcher producer.
its just a job for them. I program and just move bits around. I dont have to care about the underlying bits. art doesnt work the same way.
why do they do this  then also have the audacity to be shocked when fans dont enjoy the trash heap they serve
I have a conspiracy theory. the reason they dont typically want fans of the game or even people who have played or know the game is the end goal isn t to please any of them but to slowly integrate those of the masses they were previously unable to reach. they have been trying to program the masses for years through the news  social media  tv shows  and movies  however  they were not able to reach a certain portion of the populace due to the innate interest these people have  would naturally conflict and so would avoid those outlets where they had control. so there in the darkness a plan was made to obtain the ips and steal the ideas of those whose interest were in line with what they could not reach and change them. through repetition even though previously opposed the views would eventually change to fit in with what they want you to believe.
I think the witcher series follow the books pretty closely but from a different perspective. season 2 wasn t better than s1  mainly because it felt very rushed.
these writers need to be black listed from gaming and comics
if I owned a company that was creating a show  movie  videogame or whatever  that is based on a well loved franchise with a massive number of fans  and the writers I hired had zero respect for the source material   actively hated it  I would fire them all. the fact that netflix hired them and knew about their hate for the franchise and still kept them as writers says all you need to know about how these companies dont care and aren t trying to create entertainment that fans want or like  they are only interested in creating propaganda.  just look at she-hulk   the rings of power  where the writers of these shows actively admitted that they hate the fans and wrote their series just to piss them off.  as they mock the fans . and then they complain when fans get angry and stop watching. all these woke activists being hired as writers need to be fired.
yeah we made fun of what they wrote too. I suggest if they dont like the source material then maybe they should quit and do something else
actors can get away with not liking the genre. patrick stewart never liked sci-fI  but he killed it as picard  for example. the writing was so good on tng  though... writers better like the base content.
Im not sure there is hope to reclaim these franchises. we need to starve these studios and companies and build new and better stories ourselves.
I still say we should ve gatekeeped more now before Im lambasted let me explain I was never one for gatekeeping I was for sharing our love for all games  fantasy  etc etc but when these people who wanted to but into our nerd culture who demanded we change what we love for them to change it to make it better for them who sheer ego demanded we change our beloved ips to suit them well look at what these people have done to our beloved ips.
if you dont like the source material for a product that youre turning into a tv  movie  video game or whatever why would you even agree to do it to begin with
let s not play the game because you ll realize that our series is shit
for the last of us the actual game director is actually a big part of the tv series... that being said tlou doesnt need a tv series... it didn t need a sequel  especially what we got. it definitely didn t need a 2nd yes 2nd  remaster... and as a fan I dont particularly think it needed a series. but I do believe its being made primarily for people who will never actually play a video game  so Im just going to ignore it even though I trust that it wont be blatantly offensive in any way.
the only reason the series wasn t a failure was because of henry cavil
at least we still have ciri. I love the character and actress. I remember when netflix wanted cirI to be an african american indian girl  so glad they came to their senses.
what happened to henry cavill s highlander remake
seeing so many of my favorite franchises being destroyed and the sea of meh or garbage tv and movies out today..it literally has made me unenthusiastic and pretty bland with any movie or tv show that comes out..those franchises were always my go to  lotw  sw  doctor who  superheroes  but they ve destroyed all of it and I pretty much watch zero movies and tv now because I just cant be bothered anymore.
thats not surprising  however  henry cavill is a huge fan of the books and witcher 3
a lot of the casting in the series is insult to the source material. I say henry and freya are the only ones making it good and even though preya or what her name is doesnt look really like yennefer more like bollywood adaptation she is still good actress and I like her. at least she looks more like her character than the horrible casting for fringilla vigo. they are both supposed to be of a ghastly white complexion and look somewhat similar. yet yennefer in the series is indian even though good actress and gorgeous woman its still weird but still far better than when they casted the most african woman ever as fringilla vigo. like yes its fantasy world but itshould honor the source and also its based on middle ages europe especially poland. redania is practically old poland. I would understand if  they really had to add black actors for some weird reason  if they added some zerrikanian character or ofier character for arab actor no they make my ilov  the druid cant remember the english name.  an arabian looking character  when if its in the books like in games he is from skellige which is this worlds norse people  vikings .
the only reason to use an existing ip is to tap into the existing fan base and hopefully expanding it. if you didn t want the fans it doesnt make sense to take the ip. just make something new thatsucks.
henry cavil rules.
Im going to admitsomething  and its going to make a lot of sense. I like the witcher episodes. I never played the games or read the books. Ive always been interested in the witcher s story but didn t want to get absorbed into another video game and so stayed away from it. when I saw the witcher was a new tv show  I had to watch it. now  I do love the original Lord of the rings  movies and the books. but will not touch the new series. I felt its emptiness and lack of heart when I had a trailer randomly pop up as an advertisement. not knowing what it was at first  I said to myself   there s no way this is what I think it is  Lord of the rings . it looks so.... dull. I know where you people are coming from.
Imean  watching the show  even s1 as a fan. from the getgo it feels off. from geralt not resembling his book counterpart to outright race-swapping. we know they dont care  its good thatsomeone part of that production confirmed it.
this week in  least surprising news ...
there are so many people from central europe who absolutellly love witcher. Im czech and I growe up with those stories  heck I even remember how people were wearing their witcher medailons on high school. we have dozens of fan projects here- cons  larps  fan made music  fan made movies. now beacause of this  witcher  series we have civil war inside fandom and people who watch only netflix call us toxic. Im sorry  Im into this ever since 2007  long before witcher 3 and long before netflix took it as granted those nerds can save their platform with their money.
I know right   did you see the live action  uncharted  fan film starring nathan fillion and stephen lang  it was better than the theatrical version with tom holland.and I liked the teatrical version.
star trek is a good example.  every time the show runners say the next season they will go back to the  star trek  experience  good stories  good characters  hopeful future  and then they dont do that.  they make dreck.  but afterwards  they say they ll make it more like  star trek  again.  cycle repeat.
from the moment I first watched the show I could tell they didn t appreciate the video game. characters were totally different. nothing even felt similar. sucks to see this happen. henry cavill loves the game  but not sure how much input he has.
well I never read the book or played the game but I have seen the witcher 1 2 season  so far I like. but I do agree with melonie mac.  so yeah.
I couldnt find any video of you saying this  but are you aware there is an indie game being developed like the old tomb raider games  its called among walls.
at this point adaptations aren t adaptations anymorenot even lame fanfics - you need to like the source material for it to be fanfic - its just buying out a popular brand franchise name to make money on its popularity with completely different than before and  mediocre products
I read almost all the books and played the games.  season 1 was ok but we know we all watch it for our man crush henry.  what almost lost me was when yennifer could wield a dagger and fight as well has geralt in  the cave. in the books she was actually poked fun at.  so they wanted a mary sue I guess in the show   season 2 was not that good. focusing the story away from geralt and more on  the message   then sticking to the source material.  season 3 will probably be the same.  blood elves will bomb because honestly most dont even want it. its like watching a disney tv show now
daily stickied reminder  how can you fuck up another beloved franchise today -disney s employee intranet instant messenger
apparently still in the works but we ll see.
I read all the books and played all the games and I hated how they mutilated a great saga and the characters. they did a few things right but hollywood does what it does best and destroyed good source material in favour of their own terrible fan fiction.
how sad is it that having a writer of a project being a fan of its source material is a  breath of fresh air .  thatshould just be the norm.
I think I can call myself a pretty big witcher fan   the books are nothing short of genius   and the games are  amazing especially 3..   tris marigold is my favorite female character in the witcher   but much like most of the netflix series  she s a completely  other character... I kinda feel sorry for henry cavill  he s perfect for gerald   and superman and napoleon solo  .. because he s the only good thing about netflixs woke witcher...dam sham.
well Im not surprised that they did that.
Im still mad how bad they did my boy eskel....
okay  this is the hottest nerd Ive ever seen.
and now we know why they totally deviated from the lore on multiple characters.
let s be honest thatshow is solo carried by cavill. like without him no one would watch it. and he is the only one who played respects the game and its fans. interesting.
we knew that. itshowed in the product and if I recall correctly some of those loser posted tweets saying so too.
I always thought the show should have been called the witcher and friends.
writing crew that likes the source material  unpossible!
Im ok with last of us actors not playing the game.but thats just a personal position  considering I own and haven t played the second one yet due to a lot of negative reception at the game awards for that year
last of us trailer looks like a shot for shot remake of the game. they dont look like the characters but they re phenomenal actors. I wouldn t worry.
I think the best way to pronounce sapkowskI s name in english would be  an-jay    .
thatscreams rian johnson on star wars he hated and disrespected the source material  the fandom and the legacy. me and my brother are witcher games fans we tried to watch the witcher series knowing full well its a netflix production woke prod.  well I tapped out finishing season 1 and my brother finished 2nd season and that would be his last  our expectations for this were low but holy fvvvck. sorry cavill we tried mate props to you if leave the witcher series.
me reading the comment section    my people!
I watched the first season when it came out and was disappointed with it. they weren t horrible  but it wasn t the witcher  it felt like a different franchise with the name of witcher on it  kinda like what bethesda did to the original prey.
dont get me wrong  I love the books  read the whole series. but geralt is not the main character  cirI is. geralt ends up just trying to find cirI the whole series. he s just there cuz he was a badass and it felt like the writer didn t know what to do with him anymore  so they made 2 stories. in my opinion geralt should ve been the gandolf type  a mentor in the heroes journey
I hate the new kids on the block  I cant hear  step one ...without thinking  we can have lots of fun. ...and so on.
season 2 was basically witcher equalivement of rings of power
these guys aren t the same guys that make the animation stuff right
in fairness the og writer hated the game
this is what happens when you have people working for you that aren t passionate about the project...even worse they actively hate it they just get a fat paycheck and the credits for their   career   you need people like ian mckellen who was known for having the hobbit book under his rope and if he didn t think something was fine he pulled out the book to reference it. you need people like jon favreau the man that made the marvel cinematic universe  or gave disney actually something good in the form of the mandalorian you need passionate nerds that love their work that go the extra mile.but no those fucking scum hire twats like the rop   tolkien   scholar. the racist and sexist diversity officer of the university of glasgow that wrote articles calling tolkien a racist. thats the only   expert   that blessed their story the actual real scholars got fired for actually doing their job.
why do they even make things they hate  f those people. let s make our own hollywood
well hollywood better smarten up soon because they have a giant problem on their hands that they dont know about yet. aI art. you can create unique short video clips using other ones and typing in text what you want to add to it. eventually this will become good enough to create whole scenes with digital characters following a line of text. when this happens people will be able to easily create their own entertainment even to the point of continuing stories through fan fiction for major franchises. if you dont profit off it  studios have no rights to it. all those people annoyed at the superficial and invasive messaging will easily start making their own stuff at far less cost and effort. the industry could collapse if it doesnt wise up. the industry doesnt have the foresight to see the emerging problem yet. this may all happen even before we build a fully reliable autonomous car.
it was painfully obvious in season 2.
wow  the writers hate the ip they are working on  just like star wars  star trek  dr who   plus so many more that it would make my comment too long . here s an idea - I think all the fans who have been disenfranchised over the past 6 years should make a documentary on hollywood and the mainstream media. then we could all work on something we hate too.
the only geralt for me is doug cockle
nobody cares what the writers like  its not for them. its for the fans.
imagine being in the army and when you get oversea s you tell your c.o.   umm.... see the thing is... I am not really sold on this whole united states thing.... I am more of a dprk kinda guy....thats not gonna be an issue is it
so they dont like the books but use the ideas and plot for their writing. wouldn t it qualify them as f  ng hypocrites and outright thieves
if most of the writers hate the books and games why are they allowed to adapt these works.
I wouldn t work on a job if I didn t like the source material so I dont understand why they do this. Imean Im a musician  composer and have a recording studio but I dont make music or record music that I dont like. I really dont get this mindset of working on something that you dont appreciate.
the way you feel about tomb raider I feel about God of war I seriously dont think the reboots should ve been God of war despite everyone and their mother singing its praises course Im probably like one of 6 people on planet earth who thinks that
sounds like netflix needs to replace the witcher s writers. they have so many good things going for the series. please  netflix  dont let them ruin this.
wot rest in peace
how many proposals do you have to deal with on a daily basis super hotfemales in these spaces are like not terribly common.
I am not a gamer  original d d the exception  but I have read sapkowskI s complete witcher series and think it a fantasy masterpiece.  not only did they completely destroy the plot structure of the books  but they totally changed some characters until they are unrecognizable  and I dont mean race swapping.  you could make the case that cirI is the main character of the series with geralt a close second and there is no dearth of interesting female characters.  yet  as in  rings of power  the male characters are emasculated to make this a show about strong female sorceresses.  I have never watched an episode  though had there been any attempt to be faithful to the books  I would have been an ardent fan.
they hate em cause both books and games are better than anything they can come up with
thank heaven s this produced is no longer involved in the witcher. why do people who dislike even hate source material choose such jobs  btw  I dont understand why so many of you dislike this drama.
they dont read the books nor play the games
deviation from the source material is nothing new nor recent when it comes to adapting literary works for film tv stage. many of the zorro tv shows and movies  the 1920 movie being an exception deviated heavily from johnston mcculley  zorro creator  curse of capistrano novel. the same also can be said about arnold schwarzenegger s conan movies which have nothing to do with robert e howard s novels and also the troy movie which took tons of liberties with homer.now if youre talking about fleming and tolkien I do see a problem. after fleming s death the bond movies have became alienated from his novels and I point the point the finger at moonraker for starting this though I appreciate eon  for at least trying to make amends with casino royale which went back to the spirit of the original novel.
yeah  I pretty much figured cavill bailed after season 3 because he realized the crappy direction they were taking the show. everyone from the show runner to the writing staff are woke weirdos who hate the source material and fans. cavill saw the writing on the wall and warner bros dc is finally ditching the woke wagon with superman  so that makes sense to me. cavill is my favorite superman anyways  and witcher s season 4 will go over about as well as marvel s phase 4.
if they hate the ip  they should not be working with it
looks like they have the wrong writers on board for the project.  maybe they shoulda took the she-hulk project.  the witcher lore is actually well written.
0 55 Im guessing the name is pronounced ahn-dray.
as if naughty dog didnt turn me away enough with all the bs around tlou2 but the show runners told the actors not to play the game or know about the original story  right there is enough to turn your back on a show alone
a lot of writers today seem to be the equivalent of vegan chefs running a steak restaurant... you dont like our tofu  youre racists sexist homophobic etc etc. be nice to get a steak on the odd occasion.
why are they even writers on these shows.
of course they dislike it.. there s a powerful and dangerous male  a dark world where virtue has to shine forth  diverse characters that are not yearning for representation... there s deep lore and actual narrative...they find it hard to insert their crap into this masterpiece so they have to destroy it and vandalize it. their philosophy is thus  let s not create our own woke stories. let s vandalize consolidated stories and transform them into what they are not  relying on fans watching it out of nostalgia  affection for the original story.  somehow they feel smart thinking that this will actually work.
cant support season 3 now. thanks for letting me know
why would they hire writers who hate the source material  that is like hiring bill maher to lead a Bible study.
why I am not surprised. oh wait  this has been happening since the gb  reboot .
when I saw how they casted the netflix witcher  I refused to watch it. Ive long since sworn off every show that participates in the gingercide and have since just written off everything that does woke casting. its saved me from wasting my time on a lot of garbage.
we dont like itso we going to burn it to ash. a shame we are here instead of actually seeking people who like it and wish to express. I am going to die before I get where I can run my own studio but these people are leaving a lot of easy pickings on the table.
so they essentially believe that we ll just rampantly consume any franchise off the popularity of the title alone.  yeah imma head out of hollywierd productions completely.
henry is our only hope.
hey  I haven t played the witcher iiI yetcut me some slack will ya
witcher could have been a good show  the wrong people are in charge. cavil has bad luck with who he works with
one thing that we need to forcibly change in the lingo being used is stop saying fans. every time they say fan we need to say customer. they can kindly shove that crap down their throats. we are the customers. we pay them for the product we want.
agreed
that was pretty evident in season 2. I dont think this comes as a revelation to anyone now. they doubled down on screen time for stupid  shoehorned in characters that nobody cared much about and doubled down on bad casting...for  muh diversitah . plus  for every instance of aesthetic and atmospheric improvement there were just as many of pure  cheap  cringe. when I look at geralt s new armor I physically shudder.
I knew the show was dogshit right away. they crammed scenes of the cirI story that didn t even exist in the book into episodes that could have been all about geralt and the original short stories. such a bonehead move.
they dont like gamers  off thing to bring uo when the writers dislike the books and well the writer who made the books doesnt like the games or gaming as a medium of story telling
step 1  find a beloved franchise.step 2  change everything for a  modern audience .step 3  call the fans of said franchise bigots if they dont like it.step 4  find next franchise.
this is why I love piracy.
I liked the show  but I went into it without playing the witcher and having limited knowledge on the lore.   played the games after.  I thought it was dumb of them to try and do the same story thats already in the game.  they should have got clearance to start a  new witcher character with geralt just being a cameo or legend.   or they should have went pre geralt time period and chose a time where lore is limited.  these people that keep trying to remake someones elses story just keep failing. maybe they will learn eventually.
I remember when this article popped up in my news feed  I was sadly not surprised. from what I cantell  fans who haven t read the original books either really liked it or are lukewarm with it  especially after season 2 . the fans who read the books  practically despised it or at the very least  thought it was a mediocre mess. what baffles me is that how stupid and ego centric these writers are. they actually believe they could 1 up the original author and cdprojekt red s productions. say what you will about their  messy cyberpunk launch but when it came to the witcher  cdpr made sure the entire staff where witcher lore scholars. I never understood how this post modern   with my no experience  I think I can do better than the original  attitude became popular and infested the professional world. Im very sad we wont get a proper witcher screen adaptation anytime soon. I will say  the fan made polish witcher movie was really good for such a small budget. it had way more heart and soul than netflix s garbage.
Im convinced we live in hell. we re all poor and the nice things we do get are taken from us.
makes zero sense to hire writers for a show when they hate the source material. no  you hire people that actually have a passion for the games  books  and fans. you cant expect a good result when you are actively going against not only what made the witcher so great  but also going against the fans who love the series so dearly.
so they dive headfirst into something they hate  I know its just for the money ... but damn  why
I am not saying that movie series adaptations should only be done ultra fans that knows everything single thing about the franchise  but it is asking too much that the person at least doesnt hate the thing  why is that all those movies series being made by people that openly hate the source material  the writers aren t having fun because they hate what they are doing  the fans aren t having fun because the product is shit  the shareholders aren t having fun because they are losing money. is this all one big exercise of spite  do they hate the fans that much
you could tell they hated the witcher with how badly they butchered the story and all the characters in season 2  I was worried after season 1 with how they fucked up vigilforts and fringilla and killing off mousesack but I was still hopeful they would  somehow fix all that in later seasons  that hope died more and more with every episode of season 2  they have completely fucked the storyline from the books so badly and gone out of their way to change and ruin every character along the way  the only good thing was geralt and I think that is solely down to henry cavil actually being a fan and having his own input on how geralt would act.
always a good start......
I dont know too much about the witcher  but if from the wheel of time I remember for example the hype for its adaptation  me included  in summary the books are basically based on an almost matriarchal society and by introducing wokism this made this aspect exaggerate so much that I found myself cringing at times and with an especially disappointing ending where the main character  who of course is a man and God forbid they give him the spotlight  is taken away so much from the action that is given instead to the female characters  argumentatively makes no sense  just disappointing. so for me no more live action wheel of time  itsucks. loving the videos melonie  great job  maybe you can make a video about this  cheers.
why dont they write their own story  then  oh yeah  because they couldn t.
them not liking source material wouldn t be such a problem if what they wrote instead was any good. but everything they added  pretty much entire season 2 main plot  is just cringe generic shit and bad tv. they are just bad at writing their own stuff  full of illogical and plot hole moments  breaking the characters and their motivations  yen  vesemir   focusing on pointless story arches  fringilla  etc. and final insult was killing a dude that they called eskel  not him at all by personality  and naming episode 6  dear friend   that was just middle finger to the fans of books and games. a shame because blood of elves is best witcher novel  and they wasted it on their own bad fanfiction.
the last of us will be okay with playstation productions  not just hbo. imo one of the best games ever made   there was no shortage of great playstation games at the time! they were making great games all through the ps3 life cycle.good to hear someone speak up about the witcher. what a letdown that has become
heard the new xmen is going to be on some modern race switching  wokee bull shyte as well.
I feel like itshould be 75  geralts view. 20  ciris view. 5  yennefers. I really dont care about his romance stories. I only care about witchers doing witcher shit. at least where we are in his story. later in the story line cirI becomes the main story line. at that point itshould shift to 40  geralts view. 60  ciris view. yennefer being a whisper at that point. love stories in monster slaying games are weird.
uh... that doesnt sound good. Im reading the books right now  and love them  but I gotta say  the show has been pretty true to the source material so far  as far as I cantell. I sure hope they dont ruin this going forward.
the author stated he doesnt care for video games at all and told cd project red not to involve him  he only sold them game rights for some money  and doesnt care for it and doesnt concider the games apart his universe
its this  many years ago  in that fabled decade known as the 80 s  the older siblings of gen x liked stuff. the younger  softer  first invasion wave of millennial siblings didn t like getting hazed by the older  jerk  siblings. so the youngers waited  studied  seethed bile and got into positions of power in entertainment whilst the slacker gen x continued as consumers. decades later  the youngers got revenge by destroying gen x s beloved franchises.in the sequel  gen x strikes back. you could remove gen x and millennial and itstill works.
dont feel this is new. the writers and producers have hated comics  games  books  older movies  older tv shows  and history in general for quite some time now.
they must learn from top gun maverick
I just dont see the point of spending a ton of money to buy an existing ip if youre planning to get rid of all the fans and throw out all the lore to make something completely different. just make your own ip at that point. it ll be cheaper and you wont be starting with a ton of hate from fans of the old ip.
this is f-ing crime.
I hate to say it  because I really like the geralt parts of the witcher show  but just claiming to be a fan doesnt work. the showrunners of rings of power said they were huge fans of tolkien... and we know how that worked out. henry cavill has proved that he really is a fan of nerd stuff  so I trust him to honor the books  but he can only do so much.
they could just do 10 seasons of geralt doing side quests and it would be great. american shows are dead.
good thing there was a sane soul in that production team. but he was now a former member. now there is less sanity....
they hate something they never read or played. makes a lot of sense from a snowflake perspective!
gosh youre such smart n very beautiful woman its very adimirable your opinions n youtube channel keep up the amazing work
I have to admit   you will ban me for this    I did love  the tomb rider reboot  however   I didn t play the previous one  I did play legend once didn t trap me as the reboot  now  regarding the witcher or more like  writers hate the source material   no 5hi7  hahaha  I already give up on the   original source  adaptation into tv movie   I see those as a different think and did enjoy halo and ... ... ... thats it  Imean  did enjoy  arcane  and  cyberpunk  edgerunner    cry with this one actually    but I dont know their lore. resident evil however  well  stuff like that makes me lose hope on humanity. hahaha. love your content  have an amazing day
I dont watch much at all of this fantasy stuff except the witcher. I haven t felt inundated with women s like so much of the other shows.
its a new trend xd
only thing good on the witcher series was cavill and my heart broke for the man who loved this ip so much he nearly would of been geralt for free. hissrich is a nekker
whelp   I guess I can remove the witcher from my list now
as a fan of the witcher games and books  I almost completely disown the show and find it hard to see it as part of the amazing witcher universe. it has some cool elements with henry playing geralt  cus he is actually a fan of the source material and immerses himself in the character when acting him  but that alone isn t enough to make me look forward to seeing more episodes. I pretty much dislike every other character in the show that I loved in the books and games. yennefer for example is like a dumber version of herself in the show  which is one of my all-time favourite characters ever ruined. Im not counting on it getting better  because as a fan I feel I ll be let down  better to just ignore it and focus on the pre-existing good stuff haha but if it changes for the better it ll be a pleasant surprise. it kinda reminds me of what paramount did to halo... change change change everything until it barely resembles what people loved about it in the first place  then youre left wondering who they actually made it for...
legitimately though  how can anyone think hiring people who hate the ip is a good idea
you cantell. the signs were there
I only read the books once  and after two episodes of the first season I could tell they know nothing about the series and just used the name to promote their delusions and virtue signals. they even killed off eskel in season two  a character from the games  the very games that take place after the books!!!!!!!! I feel sorry for cavil  he loves the books and has admitted to  correcting  people on set about the lore  and those  people  are without a doubt the showrunner and her diversity hire lackeys.
I stopped this mid 1st season. I got tired of season a show that did not even show the main character I wanted to see.
I honestly hate this for henry cavill. if you follow this dude  a little bit you cantell he likes his space and his game time or book time. he loves the witcher franchise and initially got into it from the books which then got him into the game. he sought out this role very actively  consistently persistent  he wanted to do justice to this franchise that he loves  and specifically with geralt. even trying to pay homage and respect to the voice actor for geralt from the game. with thatsaid  through trailers  and then the first season  it was so easy to see the influence of both netflix  and the producers writers who were not respecting the source material or even following it. they were taking the popularity of the franchise  and then bit by bit  injecting their own personal desires  and agendas and interpretations where there should be none. if you want to do your own thing with your own original spin  then create your own thing  thats fine. but when you take a franchise with a routed pre-existing source material that youre connecting yourself to  then you half to follow thatsource material. you have to respect it and be genuine with it. otherwise  you show your true colors in simply using a franchise for your own selfish means  and that results in making it all about you or your agenda. and thats bullshit.I think at the beginning of season two I just quit watching. I couldn t take the blatant disregard for the source material and injection of producers and writers of their own agendas over the lore and characters and world. as we see time and time again  it is so disrespectful  disingenuous  disconnecting  and most importantly  not entertaining. social media exist for you to sit there and circle jerk  your self  and your friends over your biases and beliefs and politically correct social justice is or whatever the fuck you want to get clicks and views over  entertainment is not your platform for your personal shit. entertainment is escapism where we go to get a breath of fresh air from the 24 seven bullshit that consumes our every day lives with social media  and all these other forms of political correct bullshit.  so when you take a franchise with no intention of authentic representation and respect to the source material  and just decide to make shit about you  not only is that disrespectful and jarring to the source material that we all know  and love  but its not entertaining. you ve removed the elements of entertainment escapism and replaced it with yourself and your culturally relevant twitter page shit. insecure self seeking attention is always obvious  and there sure is hell is no entertainment there..going back to henry cavill  I think the dude is very genuine  with his love and desire to be authentic with this franchise. however  at the end of the day you are a employee  and the boss is called the shots.  Im sure he voices his frustration as other actors have mentioned to a kind degree in different interviews  but this shit has got to be getting under his skin. because its not even the witcher anymore  or itsure as hell ain t following it. cd pr did it right when they took on this fiction. they also read the books and did their homework. they found areas in the books source material where there were gaps or things weren t elaborated on fully that they could then in a respectful way  expound upon. and through that kind of respectful  authentic interpretation of the source material  do you have the successful witcher game franchise. but obviously netflix dont give a shit about that  and from what has been learned here in this video  neither do the writers or the producers are  and I have no interest in spending any time watching some insecure individual or group  take a franchise I love and turn it into their own twitter social media page.
I will believe it when I see it.
the new tomb raider games were fun  but it was basically uncharted.
and that why they dont make nearly as much money as the original witcher books was alright from what I heard but the games made more money
your pronunciation of  andrzej  was spot on until the last letter. youread it as you would read  y    like in  hay .
why did they get hired then
doesnt really matter what they say they like or not  because you have people like the ones writing lotr which claims they are  superfans  or  love itso so much  but wants to pervert the lore and books with their own political agendas.
good thing henry cavill jumped ship after season 3
not surprised. it was clear they hate the original source material way before s1 came out. as soon as they revealed who would play yennefer  the writing was on the wall. they made it very clear that the show was meant to be woke trash and insult both the fans and the source material.it is a netflix show after all  what else was to be expected  ...thats why Ive never watched anything from the show at all  and never will  even if I was paid for it.well  Ive never subscribed to netflix at all in the first place  and never would even if it was only 1 cent to be subscribed for life  so...I ll never give any money to a company who actively hates me and spends all their time spitting in my face. only dummies   and wokes   would give netflix money and or watch anything they make.
its like paul verhooven s  starship troopers .  he read a page or two of the original novel and put it down.  the quality of his movie as a political screed parody is great  but he really had complete disdain for heinlein s work.
is hero wars the same company as adventure quest
I feel like there needs to be a freakin rule against giving people projects who are on record saying they either hate the source material or have no interest in the source material. its insulting to the fans  to the ip  and to everyone involved. its like a vegan trying to win a bbq ribs competition by saying well I hate meat so ima give you cauliflower instead
its not about what they like. wtf is wrong with these ppl  its what the fans like. they keep making stupid mistakes
I watched the witcher and this was obvious. the only good part about the show was henry cavil and of course he loves the books and games.
a bunch of wokie writers  actively dislike  an ip based on mythology from european cultures  but write for it anyway so they can make it whatever they want the show was just so good I would have never guessed
henry needs a better agent. what are these producers doing
its funny how these woke hollywood writers cannot understand that thanks to the book and game they have a tv show adaptation! what baffles me is how hollywood gets permission to make a tv show  I for instance if I create something successful and someone wants to do a live action tv show they must follow my script and source material otherwise no deal!!! and if a show its made without my consent I will definitely sue them! now henry cavill is not bad as geralt also there are some issues that I have with trish being a person of color instead of red hair  white skin like in the game witcher 2 and 3! that trish is not that appealing to me at all. me being a latino I dont care about representation all I care about is that the characters are exactly portrayed its not that hard!
no shit hollywood hates fans. that cesspool has done everything to put us down since 2016  ghostbusters remake
netflix needs a massive rework. someone with elon money needs to come in buy netflix  fire staff    hire better people
friday night tikes. better show.
I liked the first season of the show - however season 2 has severe issues  except episode 1 which was pretty bloody good . let s hope thatseason 3 onwards will be better.ps  I like the new tomb raider games a lot. I am absolutely an original tomb raider fan. I played all games on release  including the first one back in 1996 and still I dont share your opinion on this topic at all. in my opinion the best game in the entire franchise is tomb raider 2013.it would be nice if you stop pretending to speak for all  old  tomb raider fans because youre not. I halso have my doubts that you where actually a fan when the first game was released unless youre a lot older than you look or played the game at an incredibly young age.
they should fire them
these writers dont have the right to disparage polish slavic culture which is the background for the witcher material  its not diversity to under-mind the material thatsapkowskI attempted to express to the world at large...if they dont like sapkowskI s work then dont write for the show  let someone who is willing to show faith to the source material step up!
after season 3 im done watching if they wanna go that direction
I have a good deal of respect for henry cavill  but the witcher show is beyond saving. its a mockery and disgrace. I stopped watching a few episodes into season 1 when I realized they d complete rewritten core components. Ive been done with this behavior from show runners for a long time.
suffered through the first season out of loyalty. second season watched ten minutes  noticed the abundance of black people in fantasy europe  backed out.
I always enjoyed the x-men cartoon  but who is actually making this  the writer wants only fans of the x-men to be involved  great  but what about the message
if they hate it  they want it destroyed. I will not be watching this show. if you dont like it  you will not honor its source material
can we talk about how gay the new gotham knights game is  I dont have a problem with gay people but it feels like propaganda now. flags in the belfry. on coffee mugs. in emails  barbara talking about  going with tim to pride and wearing a rainbow cape and having jason wear a rainbow hood cause allyship is important  pride crosswalks  pride murals  lesbian npcs  nightwing writing an email about being bI basically. random conversations in the overworld. like this is a batman game. where s the wider roster of villains  the gothic gotham  it was so shitty. worst of all  they made harley ugly.
the witcher books written by andreI are a source of national pride for ukrainians. you d think the wokies would have been soooooo concerned about doing right by the people of ukraine. oh wait that couldn t all be a lie could it
studios need to stop hiring people that do not enjoy and respect the source material. these ip s are worthless without fans and as the decline of marvel and  other fandoms are proving we wont keep throwing money at material we dont enjoy.
itshows. if it wasn t for the wonderful performance by henry cavill I wouldn t have been able to watch both seasons of the witcher  but it was a big mess. no likeable characters  no consistency in the world  convoluted storytelling  predictable outcomes  no emotional resonance. if you watch the original polish witcher movie  I believe its called the hexer  it will show you how much the interpretation of text matters. although the main story is similar  there is far more cultural feel  more sincerity and humanity  more of a believable world. Im not suggesting its a great film  but its far better than the netflix reimagining.
should fire them all then. any production of any sort is always better when there is passion not spite
I thought the last of us was wayyyyyy overrated. I dont make it a secret  I hate interactive movie games  games you watch more than play  the 2nd one is much worse with that. if anyone likes it  cool. I like gameplay  the core mechanic of a videogame. games you play metroid dreadhollow knightsuper mario odyssey legend of zelda breath of the wild super mario odyssey   mario makerblasphemous bloodstained rotn  cotm  cotm2the messengertmnt shredder s revenge mega man 11re2 remake  replaying re remake for gamecube  the best re game super meat boyI like challenging  difficult games you play.these are games you play that have few minutes of cutscene. mostly western games  especially console  is a movie you barely do anything in  especially the last of us 1 but really bad with tlou2.games you play  much harder to do the political crap
henry cavill is consistently wasted in everything he s in because he s drawn to nerd shit and all they wanna do is destroy nerd shit. must be very frustrating for him. hopefully  someday he ll get a genre role that will allow him to actually take front and center.
the witcher series was to the witcher books as amazon 4mgs of power was to Lord of the rings.
this will probably hurt a lot of the cavill fangirls  and unfortunately... boys. ugh!!!   but the show was never  good . apart from the episode  moon betrayer   or whatever its titled which is a weird title in itself as I still dont get what it means  the show is a waste of time  energy  and resources. there are other fun shows and films to watch. I knew the so-called  writers  and  producers  never really cared about the author s work  and itshows  it really does. thats not even an  opinion   but a fact. dont like it  couldn t care less. xd
soooo they dont like source material  but use it to make something  ok.
hard disagree. netflix s witcher has been going well in my view apart from a few changes in the lore i.e. eskel. as far as the future goes there s always going to be a worry for some nutjob extremist invading and ruining it.go steelers melonie!!! love the channel and keep up the momentum!
we should put our money where our mouths are... after the atrocious rings of power I stopped buying from amazon and looked for products from other sources
ugh
its ok to like shitty shows  you just cant say they are good
@ygkemosabi  I ll say whatever I want about them. thanks for the advice though.
going well lmao thankfully youre in the minority
@ygkemosabi  let them enjoy playing with dogcrap and delude themselves about it. anybody with a brain knows this show isn t good.
@alicia norayan  my brain function is perfectly fine. Im not calling anyone brain dead for disliking the show.
no one wonder I dont watch any tv shows based off games or anything they produce.glad I just stick to game s
is anybody shocked those people are sick in the head and need to be fired the more you hate fans the more you shouldnt be in that job
they dont like us  what kinda victim shit is that
why dont they like the witcher   it has girl on girl relationship in it.
I guess the producers has not ever read the witcher books or have not play the witcher video games either bc they dont have a clue of what they are talking about bc the witcher books are great to read to see how the story is bout and to compare with it to the witcher video games are different than the story of the book bc it has different characters and different story line in the video game then it is in the book  ok melonie. anyway thats what I wanted to say bout this video and I just wanted to tell you that I think that producer doesnt have a clue of what he or she is talking about on the books and video game of the witcher  ok melonie. anyway hope you are doing well with yourself and hope you are having a great blessed day today and hope you continuing to have a wonderful and great blessed day and evening at home with your pets and with your parents and family. anyway have a great day melonie.
look.  this is an easy question.  why were they hired  then
we dont want give the fans what they want but what they need.  a rungs of powder  writer
shocker
ahhh the writers hate the things that made the witcher the commodity it is today. so they hate the reason they have a job  time to get some new writers.....
its not the witcher its the witches.
ugghhh....why do people wanna work on projects with source material that they hate... just leeeeave it alone then.I fucking loooove the witcher series  both games and books. I just wish they would make the show as awesome as itshould be...
sounds like these writers need to lose their jobs as they clearly dont have the contents best interest.
I wish henry had more power over this show...
anyone even surprised lmao look at what they did she-pukes and rings of weakness
the games I can understand a bit but the books no if hate the source material then what the    are you even doing there
why is this every hollywood writer in a nutshell its so so weird.
season 2 is a huge letdown due to those hack writers who think they re better than the original author...will not watch season 3  no a second.
just ego  these writers are jealous. they cant be successful  yet they highjack popular ip and think they can rewrite it better.
Im a big fan of the witcher books and games  but I stayed away from the netflix show because I knew there would be a bunch of tossers trying to ruin the lore or character of geralt
rip infinite pistols
its how people in the industry act nowadays.
they have to ruin everything.
edutainment  the outline of every film and tv show. the point is not to entertain but educate.
y por que los contrataron entonces
wow  Im shocked. color me surprised... I ll have coke.
you can read his name andrey sapkovsky
I gave up on the show after one episode.
yeah bros shes a gamer.  she plays iphone games!  got a problem with it   lol
why do they even apply for the job or even get hired.
then wtf even work on a project you do not even like and will not do your best to make the movie film series   fire them all.
wokies actively hate nerds and geeks.
the last of us tv show  dont play the games are you   cking serious
weel  there are fans that lov to say stupid stuff for sport to try to take them down. but its still wrong to insult pople like that. so Im torn. I dont understand this need at all and wish none of it happened at all.
I also am original stuff
thats why things went to shit in season 2
to be fare the guy who wrote the books hate the games too basically he thought that it was a dumb medium so he sold the rights for a song and a dance  then when cdpr basically got ritch off it he wanted a much bigger cut and got told to fuck off.
I said they are from the start  fanboI blindess is a disease.
explains why the second season was so off .
makes sense because I love the witcher  and hated the show
what about the tower thing
ha ha! I was burried and underground. but now Im back.
hey melanie look at this somebody is impersonating you
if you cant make fun of your source material  you dont understand it. the actors love the books  thats all that matters.and im not taking the word of a  former writer  sounds like some hate
6 23 - 6 35 or they outright hated the original games and tell you that you should just f off if you dont like what the newer games are like.
doesnt make much sense from a financial perspective  company purchase an ip for millions of dollars. company makes a show film of the ip that doesnt appeal to the core demographic. audience looses interest in ip.  company now own a worthless ip.
well yeah they dont hire people that know waht theyre doing.
I could see it. season 2 was a dumpster fire.
I guess they hate having a job. witcher doesnt exist without the source  material and without said material you dont have a show to create.
what I would say to all those writers  producers  and directors that dont like the source material or games based on the same materials. write your own damn books then. we want to see the world we loved not your garbage mutation or activist agendas.
hating the people who give you money...
it boggles the mind when anything gets adapted and they dont respect the source material then turn around and complain that people dont like what they ve made. also no we wont make an original thing either! youre all toxic for not enjoying it.
...yeah in the end is all kinda shit  and I kinda gave up... some time ago at 1. st season
fire them and get new writers. problem solved.
what a surprise. they keep calling fans who complain about changes to the source material racists and misoginists  its no wonder these things keep crashing and burning.
I dont care if you like something or hate something... at least have respect for your job.these people are so egomaniacal that they would work on a project containing works that they  actively hate . why  are they that deperate for work  do they so lack self respect  is it their goal to ruin it for the people who do like it
what s the point of hiring people who hate the source material
going to assume these  writers  are millennial single women and feminist men.
critics critiquing critically critiqued critique-made creations.
does not matter  so many simps will watch it anyway. like people who  hate  disney or did not like how got ended...... but know every little thing that happens in disney shows or the new got shows. it is what it is.
we noticed
how the bloody hell do these people keep ending up in these positions   a bunch of nobodies thinking they can do better than people who have made world acclaimed products  the books n games .
they should be fired
itshows with how mid the show is
erhm . . so you take  the success of certain branded franchise.. make your own version twisted fanfiction   and when the fans who have supported the franchised is critizing the result  they hate the fan and still going with it   does the original writers  author  creators care what other people ruin their legacy artwork   does the network that hired those type of people given them millions of budget.. hate money and want to end bankruptcy
the hero wars in video ad through me off. I really thought she said  we need 10 000  incels. what    turns out she said  we need 10 000 installs . changes the meaning entirely.
then they need new writers plain and simple. vote with your     cancel your subscriptions. seek out good shit like eric july aka young rippa this is just my opinion. there are other sources for entertainment.
fick sakes then why write for it like what is the sense in taking a job you hate that is on performance of fans.
I forgot this show existed. I am glad I never watched it and never will.
ngl I hope henry cavill drops out of the witcher  without him there s no reason to keep watching a show that is created by people that hate the source material
you dont get to change the writtings because....you didn t wrote it! youre a screen writer! not a creator. do what youre paid to do.
love you
all she does is insult people thatsay you are bad because you dont believe what I believe  and she does the same thing with Christianity
why make it then I genuinely dont understand the logic.fans make x popularcompany wants to capitalize on popularitycompany ignores everything and everyone that made x popularx which is now y fails because people wanted x and got yI dont have a business  nor did I go to school but this isn t rocket science its basic supply and demandthey see a demand and make something completely different while spitting on the people who wanted it telling them to want this other thing insteadmind blowing
writers who hate the source material which has a large fan base should not be hired to writer for the series.  what idiots would hire people who hate the story and characters to write for the show
honestly I didn t like the books. I thought they were drawn out and boring. I haven t played the games though but I heard they were really good.
they cant have yen  as her original self  what makes anyone think they can write a woman who gains power yet is still disatisfied. how dare a woman want to be a mom  its not girlboss enough. yennefer is a tragic complex character not a slay queen  sxl assaulter cause patriarchy bad fool.
ha ha!
yeah I thought season 2 was terrible
it was obvious and was the reason I didn t watch it.
most of them are brits right !  it makes sense the source is basically a poor swipe of elric  the first dark fantasy character ever he was basically an antI conan and it was a brit who created it !
witcher show is aggressively middling
well the last season was cant even be called fan fiction now.  because it was out of left field and they re not fans.  love the witcher books.  hate the show now.
1 is kinda weird due to the combat system  but 2 and 3 are good.  3 being the best.. 4 is in development.
I hear that alot but having read both the similarities are extremely superficial.
dude your are either blind or narrowsided or a combination of both there are only similarities in the world  events and story beats but the similarity is the character itself.
this one was only too obvious. love the books and the witcher 3 is a masterpiece but there was a reason I couldn t get through half of the second season . why hollywood keeps giving great series s over to handlers who hate the source material is just stupidity. just like the netflix resident evil  if it isn t made for the fans  who the hell are you making thatshite for
I have been saying day 1  fuck up  witcher  damm
this series hurt my heart so bad. I couldn t keep watching this garbage show. when the show runner made a comment about not changing things because she was feeling extra liberal  then proceeds to do that very thing
dont play the game... I need a performance that is unique  to the show not game not a rip off. they will never be 1 to 1... let the show  show what it is... or yell that its not equal to the games because you dont get saves and crafting to help deliver that quality.
haters writing shows about games they hate. means they have zero imagination where our games are very well written. why halo on paramount   suxs
typical!
so they dont like the witcher  and are making more of a show about the witcher....if you dont like it the only reason your working on it is negative
eww you clicked on ign link!
they are failed writerers  and they think they can get some fame riding the fame...
you got a real nose for like relevant shit yo
they pulled this crap with halo as well... I dont get it. I really dont. what school is teaching people to heir people who hate the source material...
...then go source your rent elsewhere.
then they dont deserve the property. boom just like that problem solved
the last of us is just a other show that had potential but its just gonna be a woke flop just to get canceled
hollywood just needs to stay in its own lane  and not worry about a lane there not on. its bad enough the gaming industry has its own problems  but hollywood needs to stick to what they know. thats not to say the gaming industry is perfect  but each company focuses on there own. its the same with movie studios  but thats never been enough for hollywood. they always got there hand in the cookie jar  but they suck at things they have no business being in. who gives a shit what some producer on netflix thinks of the witcher  you didn t make the game. here s an idea  come up with your own shit  oh wait I forgot you didn t have any originality  because logic dont exist in hollywood. how does a videogame character offend people  these are the same people who wont hire a certain actor or actress based on there look and appearance. how many women and men have been ruined by these people  too many to count.
this is the reason the only good fantasy series amazon has is vox machina  they had no creative input and it was made by people who love that world.
second season was unwatchable  the cirI show.
omfg.  if the writers dont like the books or games  gtfo of production!!!!!
just read the books and play games  netflix show is simply bad  you cant call it adaptation or even fan fiction  it makes me appreciate old polish witcher show that was pretty bad and it didn t have netflix s budget...
I hate them.
hero wars is a scam. their ads are false advertising.
star trek  star wars  ghostbusters  dc  marvel  lotr  witcher. anything that was traditionally loved by nerds became mainstream will get destroyed by subpar writers  terrible showrunners  or woke garbage.
omg  who cares
and I hate their stupid woke show. it is buffy the vampire slayer vibes  I was not even once under pressure or scared. love henry gavil
get different writers.
all these studios have to turn up the meritocracy and fire the bums this person is describing.
if you dont like the source material dont make a tv show based on it. thats simple  even idiots should be able to understand
isn t this cultural appropriation  they arr taking gaming-nerd culture and trying to spin it there own way
pourquoI ce producteur a accept  le projet s il d testait cette license..  c est incompr hensible.cecI dit  la s rie de jeux vid o est surestim e. c est sympathique  c est tout.
no wonder the show is nothing like either the book or the games. just another franchise hijacked and wrecked.
I could tell they hate it based on how shitty the show was
bye bye witcher.
if you  hate  the source material so damn much  dont write the fuckin  show. people need to be fired over shit like this.
we as fans  are completely fucked up. like  totaly.only few movies actualy made good enough by the book. abd few of those are Lord of rings  and harry potter. many others are either made very badly  or managed to do just first movie or two  eragon  percy jackson .and seems that this  taking famous name and decide to floosh the original source to toilet  is today standard. like nobidy actualy want to do movie or show about original story. everyone think they can do better than original writer who sold huge amounts of books and famous. and itseems like its same for everything they  studios  try
why bother working on an ip that they dont like. leave the project and do something else then. wtaf.
haven t watched the witcher  the new lotr series or house of the dragon. if you dont want them to continue ruining all our favorite franchises then stop paying for subscriptions to these degenerate s platforms. money talks.
well if your going to compare stories plots twists of video games vs hollywood movies.. video games will win every frkng time... only anime can rival video game story telling.. and majority of hollywood writers sucks at their job
thats just sad  egomaniac writers thinking they can rewrite the source with benefiting from its fame. nothing more pathetic than 50 50 mix of ambition and lazieness
henry carvel should fire them and the lore and books are cannon and should be the Bible to people on set to know what they are making
all my friends are new to tomb raider so they dont understand how great the originals were. the new games are just generic girl with a bow games. like far cry and uncharted.
look I think this is a real thing you need to know about but first... lets look at an ad for a mobile game that is pay to play.oh and witcher news... trust me I cant be bought... not that I know about this show... watched um.... got bored.
studios are more interested in pandering to the most extreme fringes of society  its gross and has ruined a lot of content.
noooooooooooooooo!!!    hollywood execs - plz read    bro.  just follow the books  or games if youre illiterate  and tone down the sex 80 .  done.  now you dont even have to hire writers   can spend that money on coke   child sex slaves!
too much politics and ideologies in everything anymore.
this is why I never watched the dumb netflix witcher series. I have  and have read multiple times  all the books. I knew there was absolutely no way that modern hollywood could do it justice. why watch the utter destruction of something I enjoy
considering the shite netflix pulled with the witcher. yeah  cantell they hate it. but then again  the author ain t exactly all that great himself  so eh.
seriously they ruin vikings valhalla and then dont follow source material on books and canon. for the witcher if europeans weren t so chill its cultural appropriating. and what are the writers laughing at there rewriting lore based off a book cuz they aren t creative enough to make there own shit.
I dont like the writers of thes wierd serier   and we all know its be a garbage ewen if we havent seen it.
we have people making movies  tv shows  and games who simply hate the content or ip they are working on. diversity hiring needs to end.
if you hate the books games leave our series alone and go ruin your own. just saying!!
I like the first season for what is. could have been better  but not bad. I refuse to watch beyond that. sounds like it got woke and boring.
too little too latethe witcher tv show is already cancer its beyond repair just cancel it
where were you  yeah you  reading this comment. why have you allowed this to happen  what were you doing when these spiteful nutjobs were taking over the franchises you love
books are great . witcher gamesare one of the best . netflix series only good . to many changes  from orginal story. maybe seazon 4 geralt bicomes gay
cavil is great but the rest of the show is pretty meh for me.
makes sense since both seasons are complete garbage.
well good luck replacing henry cavill  netflix. your idiocy has ruined yet another adaptation.
of course there has to be a brown guy to replace a white guy
can you just say  that your money really makes no difference  and before where you have the whole bs about money talks  well I guess the money shows  youreally dont matter. just do an of like the rest of the basics. also day by day  you and your followers get older and older and older  and as such even less relevant. lol. in regards to fans of the og stuff  haha  sure that means you have the acumen  the foresight and the knowledge to bring it to a global audience  but hey good luck with the of.
if you hate the books and hate the games  then why are you writing for the show  oh  right  its just a job. need to pay the bills  huh  awesome. thats what we want as fans! a bunch of 9-5 people who are only doing it because they cant get a job doing what they actually want.
explains why second season was absolute garbage
thats why season 2 sucked
I liked season 1 but couldn t finish season 2. it was just dumb generic fantasy  he wasn t even a monster hunter anymore
I haven t read the books  but I hate the witcher games and tv series.
I guess thats why the show sucks.
I watched epsiode 1 of the witcher  and knew. it is hot garbage.it missed the fundamental spirit of the witcher universe.
actually I hate the show  especially season 2 that was total shit
netflix witcher is just woke garbage
a nerd promoting a game with pay to win mechanism its dont know what to say
no wonder its such a shit tv adaption
henry cavill is not even that good as geralt. too bulky  too good looking  too much forcing of the raspy voice in an unnatural way. he would be good on the cover of a romantic novel  he is good as superman  but geralt he is not. also his acting is a bit wooden in general  which is why he s good as superman .
I am trying to find a joke in here!!hey! !master chief...he hates guns now prolly democrat sonic gets anxiety over rings wedding fears ! mario  says wrenches...makes his hands....hurtsamus....scared of the dark....I know! the.. writers do not like....the literature.....the game .... is based  on ....i.....i.....i! ! ....update....the creators writershad a ...scuffufle...and the books creator said. hey  take the story. stuff it up yer bumm. I ain t a pissso...uh  stoopid did not understand...demographics...annnnndddd the witcher...blew da fuq up......guess who s.... pockets ....got....uh  itchy
Im afraid to watch your video. it makes me feel like you were only put on this earth to be pleasurable on the eyes. something like that.
why bother ranting and raving  vote with your wallets.  after the crap disney  has put out  my subscription miraculously ended.
no wonder the show was trash.
the books are crap so no surprises there. if it wasn t for the games  who would actually know about the books  how many people had even heard of the witcher before the games
we could all tell the creators hated the books considering with they raceswapped lots of characters and made the stories in the show boooring asfuck. and dont make me start on how that fucking dragon looked like when the other monsters looked great         someone is jealous towards house of dragon and games of thrones.
clearly showed  because the witcher was hot pile of garbage.  even cavill couldn t save it. the rings of power was more watchable than the witcher.  I gave up on thatshow halfway through the second season.
everyone hates the fans these days.why I dont buy into bland ass God of war ragnarok. the last game was actually pretty shit
because the books and games are white culture. polish to be exact. its ok to have wakanda forever  but God forbid white people can also celebrate their own heritage and stories
witcher season 2 was God awful
I will not watch that crap last of us tv shows. the cast is horrible! she doesnt look nothing like allie.. nd same for this guy horrible.. im not watching.
not surprised you got bored. season two is absolute and complete dog shit.
explains why its crap.as much as I like cavillI think he s an awful geralt  plus the other cast are terrible.I hate netflix the witcher more than  rings of power .....and I hate rop.
the only good episode was episode 1 on season 2. otherwise its all garbage.
because it followed books plot...
