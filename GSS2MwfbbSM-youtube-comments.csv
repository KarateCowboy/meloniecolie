faster than a cancelled comic. louder then a screeching karen. more powerful then a virtue signaling tweet. can leap over facts and logic in a single bound.
them -  its all the straight people not buying the gay comics! us -  did you buy the comics  them -  no... but....
I absolutely love that picture of superman  a character who literally has the power to change the climate   holding a sign as a climate activist. it gives great insight into what they consider to be a hero  and its both hilarious and sad.
most people who read comics want some escapism and to be entertained. not too be lectured on what a terrible person they are and how they should be living their lives
I pissed myself when you said he fought against climate change
your content is so legit and brutally honest  serves as a wake up call to all the  wokees . plus I like how you always bring up lara croft  glad we found your channel.
I have no issue with people  shipping .   heck  Ive shipped a few characters back in the day. but I do have an issue when those people try to  change  the product to cater to their shipping fantasies!
even daredevil saw this comming.
Im also surprised by how long it lasted. Ive never been a fan of making comic book heroes political. I dont care what side they fall on. I want hero villian stories. and maybe some struggles from their lives and how they deal with it while being a hero. its only a matter of time until its made into a live action adaption. you are so right about them pandering to people who dont read comics. like the show family matters. I didn t need to be represented in thatshow to enjoy it. that was a funny lara joke . great video  you look amazing melonie. ttyl. have fun with your family.
melonie  its bass reeves like the fish not base. just a small correction bass was a legend of an u.s. marshall. bass worked the oklahoma territory. he was the first black deputy u.s. marshall west of the mississippi. he was born into slavery in 1838. he was one of my favorite nineteenth century heroes. he had more than 3000 arrests and killed only 14 in 32 years as a deputy u.s. marshall. sorry I got carried away. thanks for the video  melonie.
the best way that I can describe how people will remember both this series and son of kal-el as a whole as the years go by will be  so this was a thing and thank goodness its over .
this might sound a bit weird  especially since it is off topic for this video  but Im glad I found this channel on a spiritual level. for the past several years Ive been struggling with my faith  not my beliefs necessarily  but facing down and coming to grips with my own lack of conviction. Ive had to own up to my failings and face my  demons  on a deep personal level and honestly felt that I wasn t really worthy of the title of Christian. recently a very close friend started asking me at the end of each week to come to church with him and I finally ran out of excuses  between he and his wife s gentle insistence and seeing more of the commentators I watch or listen to  like your channel and a few others  find or profess their faith openly I was finally motivated to take him up on the offer. I still feel a bit out of place to a degree  like a stray dog that just happened to wander in  but reconnecting with my faith has brought me a level of peace and calm that I haven t felt in many years. sorry for being long winded  I just wanted to thank you for being one of the positive influences in this space.
never forget what the dc writers really think of you  and dont give money to people who hate you.
gabe got offended at their dropping of superman s old credo  and so created his own indie comic line  truth  justice  and the american way.
Im surprised it lasted this long.also  glad that the bass reeves story is getting told. a lot of people do not know the history of him and he was pretty bad ass.
I love your content and you are awesome at it  in two weeks you went up over 14k subs and you earned every one of them. congrats and I cant wait for u to hit 100k because its coming for sure smiley face emoji
none of us 90s kids needed to be represented! we didn t need that crap!!  I effin love you
good for gabe! he is one of the few good ones left.
I like your content. you usually have a more...wild title  not in this case tho lol  and then come in and say a lot of level headed reasonable shit lol. I personally dont like terms like  woke  etc cause its cringe as fuck to me but its a blanket term for a lot of...well intentioned shit that took a bad turn. Imean the things that they try to uncomfortably shove into entertainment media are serious topics that need to be addressed in a serious manner. also to completely rebrand something that is already well  established and cherished will always be unfounded and a bad idea
your channel finally appeared in my recommendations even though I subscribe to so many of your youtube friends and colleagues. been binge-watching all morning! love your upbeat personality  your common sense  your wit  and your charm. plus youre so funny  especially the darker you go  and just amazing! you say all we want is to be entertained with our tv and films  well your channel is entertaining af! at least we have that! btw  Im an actual real-life o.g. boomer. old  but with a few functioning brain cells left! keep speaking your mind  its so refreshing!! subscribed and followed on twitter. thank you  melonie!
pin this melanie  this is solid gold. lol
woah boy  have never heard or seen this one getting copy and pasted across all social media lmao
@blyat  doesnt matter. it fits this video topic well
ha!
omg  that was a good one! lol!!!!!!!!
@blockmasterscott  yeah  it was! hilarious!
its still funy even after the 100 500th time!
than  not  then.  shame because that would have been gold!
its pro noun man
able to leap good ratings in a single whine its a catits a box of wine ! ...its....both !
dc  nuff said!  cancels and relaunches the series
I did! gay people are still rarely depicted in fiction. it was nice to get some representation
guys
ok but not to be rude but its a small portion of the population and it would be better to not take a  character and make them gay.  im black and im able to enjoy all kinds of characters but I think there is something I d wrong with you if you need to be represented.  if all you want to see are gay people there are places to go. I personally have no interest in lgbt content but itshould be there for those who want it.
@larosha1  I dont think its a case of  needing  to be represented  its more a case thats its nice if you are. and I dont think any gay person is expecting every character to be gay  that would be silly!  but its nice to have one or two gay characters  plus its also representative of society. just how we have male characters  female characters  black characters  white characters  asian characters and so on.
@paul2377  would be actually nice if there were gay characters in a good piece of art  though...
@larosha1  disagree
@paul2377  now imagine creating a completely new and interesting superhero that has some good writing. imagine a superhero that has some cool powers and on top of that his sexuality is just a small small small part of him hinted over several issues instead of being his main thing and in your face and just everywhere.interesting characters race gender sexuality is not their main and most important part - it is their least important part because they have so many things that are interesting about them that their skin color and gender and who they sleep with is the least important part of them.la casa de papel - before you will know who is homo who is bI who is hetero and what their kinks are you will already be hooked on the story and how each of the characters is great in their own way because of all the things in their characters going for them that in the end youreally dont care what is their sexuality and thatsexuality comes naturally because of good dialogues and story instead of being show in your face and it is not the most important aspect of their characters.
then and than are different words with different meanings  genius.
sht! say it man!!!
ha!!!!bravo
you win
so  how is being clever working out for you  - tyler durden
@adrian crook  in the user s defense he got the first  than   its auto corrects fault.
@slappy      refer to above comment
got a hearty laugh out of me. take my like.
look  down in the dumpster!  is it a turd !    is it a pain !  its all those and more  its gay superman!

nice
pure gold   nick !!!!  lmao
yeah im stealing this dude.
aight king you drop this
goes for video games too. players dont want to be preached at.
exactly  the reason we play video games  read comics or watch movies is to escape reality not be reminded by it
100  correct
right  but doesnt thatsame logic apply to gay men. if anything they are more alienated than most people. imagine being not persecuted and isolated from society and engaging in escapism but expect homosexual to live within the reality instead of escapism that they are tiny minority. you can easily just choose another type of comic to read  they mostly cant  representation is very limited. I agree lgbt poltics ruins their characters but most of you are triggered by even if there s is no preaching but the character is homosexual.
@ruso kana  the fact that he s gay is beside the point. the point is this comic spends most of its time lecturing people and pushing the author s political ideology. people dont want to pay to be lectured  they canturn on the news and get that for free. this applies to gay and strait people alike. this is hardly the first time we ve had a gay comic book character either.
@gideon schlen  agree with you  man  also wanted to add that agenda and politics shouldn t be crammed and shoved in your face in comics especially taking beloved characters and changing them like that.
@ruso kana  hard to justify catering to.... what  4.5  demographic...
@studio shitake takashita  just because a demographic is small isn t a reason not to cater to them. the problem is when those doing the catering have unrealistic expectations that those who are not the chosen demographic will also be interested in   enjoy their content.    it is sad that massively unrealistic expectations and terrible  done catering  hurt the viability of small demographic content.
@alan k  comic books have always been political catered to the world they were made in. do you know how much jay garrick  alan scott  al pratt  dr. charles mcnider  jim corrigan  carter and shiera hall  ted grant  ted knight  dinah drake-lance  abby mathilda  ma  hunkel  wesley dodds  johnny l. thunder  rex tyler  diana prince-trevor and even bruce wayne  dick grayson and clark kent all spent in ww2 promoting democracy  superman promoted war bonds. diana was out mostly teaching everyone how to get along and aquaman blew up axis submarines while punching ratzis like everyone else in that time when called for. bruce and dick were legal spies of fdr for democracy and those four alongside aquaman  green arrow and speedy helped form the all-stars with many golden age heroes. ga and speedy also had their own homefront group that promoted democratic ideals with skyman  then star spangled kid   s.t.r.i.p.e.  then stripesy   shining knight  vigilante and the crimson avenger  alongside wing  stuff  squire  dyna-mite and tnt when needed if someone was unavailable.
@will n  thanks for this man it was a great insight I had no idea really had me looking into it
superman was originally fighting on behalf of socialist causes  workers rights  antI war profiteering  resource exploitation  etc   preventing us orchestrated wars in 3rd world countries  and he frequently carried out what would be called  social justice   sort of making him a  social justice warrior . most of the stuff that jon kent  this new superman  is doing is very much in line with original superman comics. he was also written to basically be a space moses by his jewish creators who were both the children of immigrants  which is also important as he s been an allegory representation for immigrants too.superman wasn t written for escapism from these sorts of topics and not all media should be escapism. no one is going to be mad at captain america for punching hitler  are they  so why is the same standard not applied to superman and social  non combative issues  thats what makes him a great character and not just  ooga booga  alien man punch hard .
@scutz  there s a difference between entertainment that conveys a message  like the original comics  and attempting to beat the audience over the head with a message only to wonder why they re not entertained. it requires balance  finesse and actual writing talent. even if this were true to superman s roots  rather than a crude imitation    that doesnt make it commercially successful. remember that it needs to be good enough for the audience to be sufficiently entertained that they feel its worth paying to read the next issue.
@gideon schlen  I do agree with your last paragraph to an extent  people are only interested in the status quo in the comics nowadays. what would sell is kal el punching lex luthor s shiny head  maybe with him saving a cat out if a tree at random intervals.superman without a message is soulless. at least they re trying to solidify jon s values.
@scutz  what really worked well a couple reboots ago was having kara as someone who grew up in a fundamentally alien society  with different morals and ethics. it gave the opportunity to organically factor in and discuss more moraly complex scenarios.
@gideon schlen  agreed  kara bolt learning human ideals customs and also teaching kryptonian ones has always been a great concept
superman has freeze breath. he could fly around and shore up the glaciers.he wouldn t be holding a fucking sign!
@dave  pretty easy to help with climate change when you have super heros who could fix alot pretty easy
move over doomsday  and lex luthor  general zod we got the ultimate villian climate change lmfao
@dave  bruh that would take years. even better  superman can just push the earth farther from the sun. boom  instant ice age.
@dave  thats the flaw between their world and ours. in dc that honestly fixed a lot of their global problems like warming and pollution for the most part
I think I remember when superman reversed time by flying so fast it reversed the rotation of the earth  lmaothis whole thing is wild to me lmao
brutally honest  lol.
lara croft is the one thing I dont agree with her on
plus she s super cute lolplus gaming nerd! wifeylol
perfect example is arrow season 3

I have a problem when they re literally  shipping  kids.they keep making kids gay  once is weird  two or three times is cause for concern.
exactly
@meat puppet  1. gay kids exist. 2.  straight kids are shipped all the time. 3. shipping isn t sexual
@greg khar n -metalhead  mad for no reason  cuz I called you out on your bigotry  and biased false narrative
@gem3l  1.no one said they didn t 2.shipping straight kids doesnt change anything.3. so wishing to underage minors to get together is weird in real life and fiction. it doesnt matter straight people are shipped with gay people its still weird just because their sexuality is different doesnt change that. and dont call me a bigot because Im holding both sexualities to the same standard. but u keep shipping minors
@andrew harrell  you are a different person then the people I was commenting too   dont be trying to make this about you
@andrew harrell  again the original comment said  we wont cater to their shipping fantasies  which is very much targeting lgbt people  and ignoring the fact that majority of these people see shipping as ok until its a gay ship.  shipping straight character with gay ones  the point of shipping is wanting to see 2 of any characters in a romantic manor. thats why shipping between 2 unconnected movies is common. and shipping fiction characters does nothing negative. neither does shipping irl. people ship because they see 2 characters having a connection that can be amazing in a romantic way. shipping is a prevalent thing in all media. so stop trying to blame just lgbt people to doing this.
@gem3l  first I kinda of agreed to the first guy  meat puppet  thats why I commented so. second nothing I said makes wishing 2 or more minors together isn t weird or inappropriate. no one blamed them ur putting words in my mouth and sure it does nothing wrong  never said it did  buts its weird no matter who   which I fucking said already   yea I want these two 5 year olds to get together ik its already been in media for a long time again never said it didn t what I said was that its weird. it doesnt make u a bad person but it makes them weird. also no one in this thread  that I can see  said that what oc said was change they changed john and made him gay. u would have a problem if its the other way around tho ur fighting for a battle u started for no reason  gays exist  so! he said he had a problem shipping kids. then said he its weird to make non-gays  gays is it not to u again what if it was flipped smh. and shipping in general isn t the problem its shipping children. dont be a hypocrite last thing u came in here saying shit no one said u made it about u why cant i
@andrew harrell  look parents ship there kids with there friends kids all the time. it is very much accepted and looked cutely upon. but these characters are 5 year olds. they are in there teens. they know what romance is. and characters dont change from bI to straight  but just like constantine  he is bI  him dating zatana doesnt make him straight. and nobody gets mad about it. so your argument isn t really valid.
@gem3l  bro no one is saying anything about being bI or straight and with parents its different because its their child talking to the parent of the other child. so what if they re teenagers its still weird they are still minors bro smh again putting words in my mouth look with constantine if he dates zatanna that doesnt mean he isn t bI but if let s say john kent wasn t bI but was straight then they turned him gay thats weird and an issue. if they turned bat woman straight we would still have the same problem just more outrage but u only care if it isn t in the lgbtq favor no one in this entire thread said anything about being bI or gays not existing u put words in every body s mouth for what so u had  evil  to fight or stand up to the problem wasn t that they were gay it was how they became gay and the shipping of minors dont get me wrong Ive shipped before minors as well but that got weird for me when so many people would fight over a ship of 2 16 year olds who probably weren t gonna be together. and I ll say this for the last time u proved nothing to why my claims aren t valid if anything u went around them and made up shitso  your claims aren t valid they re just issues u made up mid discussion.
@andrew harrell  sir you do know that there is so many straight characters already in comic history. way more then gay one. so taking from a already small group of unrepresentated people isn t really a good thing. just like irl  straight people become gay. its not anything new. me saying bI or gay is to say that jon is bI  half straight  so he cant be straight.
@andrew harrell   so what if they are teenagers its still weird they are still minors  say that to the many stephanie brown and tim drake fans. that hate when their ship isn t represented anymore.
@andrew harrell  I proved all your points invalid by stating that all gay people started off straight at some point before becoming gay. have a nice day.
but its a small part of the population.  instead of whining and demanding the vast majority cater to you by all means make your own content.   people who need to be represented in everything have problems.  if you want to see gay people there are things you can watch or read.  I personally have no interest in lgbt content but  there are those who do like it.  but its absurd to demand a vast majority cater to you.
by all means follow a channel that represents you
@gem3l  there is actually warning on doing that. when real people ship real people together on the basis of  they look cute together  which is usually the bulk of shipping...that leads to disaster and upset and not handling anything well. the same goes for marriage in general. dont be so quick to date  get engaged or married. its better to let any relationship happen on its own  in its own time. trying to play matchmaker never works. even in fiction we see it happen. for instance when riven finally did something right for once by calling it off with musa in winx season 6 and he returned in season 8....flora and helia jumped at the chance to play matchmaker again and started to argue because they tried to force them back together...and flora kind of badgered bloom and aisha into going along with it....even though we know that bloom and aisha both dont like this sort of thing and aisha was mad at riven for even showing up. we also saw this in season 2 episode 12 when they were not even a couple yet. stella was trying to provide musa with another option by playing matchmaker. again when bloom tried to point out how doing that is a very  very  very  very bad idea...stella ignored her because bloom was only dating sky because of her inviting him to save her hide in 101...ah no that doesnt count.
oh my looooool
69th! edit  I ll see myself out...
gay people s lives are not a political issue. human beings lives are not an issue. how we live our lives cannot and will not be determined by the opinion of the majority.
@a w  I never said gay people are a political issue. I was talking about in general throughout the history of comic book. when ever they try to make the characters more political. I dont like that. dont try to put words into my mouth.
@the real stephentv  I guess you hated s perman fighting the kkk
plenty of comics had political stuff. its just if you write it good  and not in your face people dont really notice and dont care as much
@a w  being gay is not a personality traits.
and then supergay fails in the box officeand start blaming the fans
@a w  once they bring  these weird politics into movies and games it ruins pretty much the entire thing....
hey youremember family matters damn let s goo  !
@akkatlah  I guess you hated red son killing off stalin.
@johnah arston  why would i
good to know  thank you for the kind correction
never heard of him but he sounds awesome and I wanna check the book!
Im still pissed they aged him up. I loved the super sons comic and was excited for more kid adventures of damian and jon. they fucked us over with that.
thank you for sharing  I love this. God bless you
@melonie mac go boom   youre welcome and thank you. seeing someone my own age with the level of faith and energy that I used to have really drove it home. keep spreading the good word  it really helps .
@patrick quick  youre not alone  patrick. God bless.
@leo zaccari  God s blessing to you as well and thank you.
melonie also has a discord with a regular prayer meeting and some good folks. feel free to join us  check her links
@joseph crabtree  I appreciate the offer though I have to confess that I know absolutely nothing about discord. Im very old fashioned  its a running joke at work that I was born old lol  but I will learn more about it and hopefully see you all there.
I used to be an athiest  before I decided to become Christian. I still have to be baptized so I am not quite Christian yet  but I am working towards it. thank you for sharing  God bless!
Jesus Christ came to save the sinners. none of us are worthy. we are ragamuffins.
Im proud to say that Ive never bought a single marvel dc shit in my life.
aw thank you so much
says the white straight cis  90s kid.
@billy hargrove      Im black .
this comment made my day. I love how you noticed that I have dark humor too  that makes me feel like Im getting better at just being myself on camera. I still have to hold myself back a little because I d be banned for my humor if I went all out  but at least I can share some of it
@melonie mac go boom  youtube  ugh. we re just so happy with how dark you can go right now!
you had me at  taxation is theft
I remember reading superman comics late 80 s early 90 s.   it was just cool stories  lots of adventures  worlds  characters  aliens  etc.  it was never centered on superman hooking up with lois lane or whoever.  I think when they do a full page of new superman kissing another male character in a provocative way  its just borderline light porn comics.  I dont think the average customer is there to buy sexual comics.
you won my attention when you shouted out eric july  but you won my heart with  taxation is theft . I hope the rest of my day is this uplifting lol.
its not just 90 s kids who want just good  entertaining content that doesnt pander  its practically everybody. the problem is that a small group of people gathered together on twitter  both in their employment and the site itself  and threw out everyone who actually loves entertainment  making itso that they are the only one s who cantalk. large companies  like disney and warner bros  had learned a couple years before this happened  that all their fans are on twitter  just a little bit before those very fans were excised. now they are listening to people who are not their fans and want to sabotage their company  and even employing some of them  because they believe the outdated concept that twitter is where all of their fans are.
Im curious what their actual sales numbers are  since I know when I worked at a store they didn t count returned unsold comics against the numbers  sold .  I bet the actual sales numbers are even more crap.as a kid of the 70s and a teen of the 80s I never saw myself in any comic book.  why   I wasn t a fricking mutant  alien from space  or super hero.  but I saw lots of characters I could identify with.  I identified with how they thought  how they felt  how they reacted to the situations around them.  they didn t need to be my color  my gender  or my shape.  anyone with an ounce of fricking imagination can see themselves as any super hero.  heck  I d daydream that I was warlock from new mutants instead of paying attention in class  because it would be awesome to be warlock.  the closest I came to seeing myself in the comics was cipher from new mutants because he was a scrawny white boy who wasn t very useful in a fight.  boy  did that ever sound like thirteen year old me!  though my curly brown hair was not like his  so that kills that.  seriously.  just write good stories without socio-political pontificating and with great characters and action and any person with a brain can find someone to identify with.
melonie mac you definitely bring the boom in each your videos. always good to see you doing so much. you getting closer to 70k no doubt you will make it there. bring that boom!!
thanks for mentioning isom again! I just managed  while listening to you talk  to order issue 1 in cover c for my dad s Christmas gift. it will make up for it if I cant finish knitting his Christmas socks fast enough. if I can  well  then  2 gifts I think he ll really like  and I ll feel less guilty for trying to read isom when he s not looking
the only self insert of a character I ever do is never in an existing character. I always imagine it in a form of an oc  original character  and either that will have a one off or dropping in now and then in a series. like if thatsioc was in the mertoid series  no romantic tomfoolery. the only screaming would be from space pirates or other enemies while samus and my character are in a killing contest similar to what gimlI and legolas did in lotr and the one that fails to kill ridley buys food and drinks. of course its non-cannon like a mofo  but just a bit of fun  especially with the idea of fighting a dragon with a meal and a drink to celebrate.
as a 90s kid myself  I approve and appreciate your response. I thinkn youreally hit the nail on the head in this video. I remember when being shocked awake was being part of counter culture and not conforming like the punk movement in decades prior. its just sad and scary now a days dude. wishing you the best in the future friend.
who didn t see this coming
very true.  I agree that just dumping any kind of  think this way  message over the actual story ruins the experience  its just not fun  its not that I dont think stories should have messages  depending on what it is and the demographic its being marketed towards  but to just not even be subtle about it and just shove it in our face makes us want to do what we usually do when someone shoves something in our face.  we resist  we dont want it  we dont want to be told that this is what we should think and we should accept it just because.  I got out of reading dc regularly during the new 52 reboot  so a lot of the newer stuff is just off my radar anyway.  I only hear about it off and on from other people and frankly I just lost interest in anything but older content.  its hard being a Christian and a comic book fan today  if Im going to pick one of the other its obviously not comics  I just wish I never had to make the choice.  sorry I probably wrote too much  I have a habit of doing that.  great video  keep it up!!!
Im a new subscriber and love your videos  there s so much wrong with content these days and I look forward to seeing you calling out more  woke  junk like this.
you mean the new superman which everyone said aging him up too quick was a bad idea ended up being a bad idea   color me shocked
thank God and Im hecking surprised it lasted as long as it did!
I was a huge comics fan.  I collected through the early 2000s and then dropped them because all the characters I d grown up with and cared about were being rewritten or phased out  and universe events were doing a huge chalkboard erase of the basic universes and then they went in with new universe wide remakes that held pretty much zero interest for me.  I found thatstories in fan fiction websites or just new web comics and novels set in original superhero universes were fun and enjoyable.  marvel and dc are going to find that the product has to appeal to enough people who buy the product  to justify production.  I used to buy 30 to 40 comics monthly  now my pull bag is 0.  Im not seeing a new generation of buyers taking my place.
so weird.   its doing terrible so we are cancelling it!  be sure to pick up our next project  with the same characters and the same writer and art.   it will be completely different Im sure.
I love how real your content is!
little quibble  pretty sure that reeves s name is pronounced like the fish  not the octave.also  the ships thing  I wasn t going to comment on that at first  but Im a geeky hermitso I feel Imust.I hate that they retcon or otherwise rewrite characters to feed egos over ships. my friends and I love making our own ships as much as we supported the canon ones. and we tease each other about how ships couldn t work because  of reasons x  y  z . and whoever s ships are getting destroyed would complain  as dramatically as captain jack sparrow   stop blowing holes in my ship!
there s a massive difference between having representation and forcing it to happen. having representation is good yes  but you cant just always force stuff to happen. its important to have a balance between having a great story and forcing in representation.
Im a new comic book reader and the dc universe ended in flashpoint  my goal is to read everything from 1985 to 2011 then move on to indie comic.
let s not act like batman kissing selina or superman kissing lois isn t sexual at all. or   soft porn  let s not nitpick thing.
@gem3l  Im not implying thatsomething like that isn t sexual  but my point remains  Im not there for that even if it is.  and your second sentence needs grammar work.
@parker brock  one sentence mistakes isn t a big deal. and my point is  you people will only say only gay characters are being sexualized even tho so many of the other  straight  couples have been sexualized for the longest time and still are. but you wanna only call out the gay ones
@gem3l  redirect to my previous two posts.  cant be more clear.
also some of them were promoted into the spots they clearly didn t deserve...lesser talented types replaced the rest and the others fell into line with the agenda...because they had to....leaving no alternative or any fightback...
thats not how it works. you guys need to stop blaming twitter for everything like thats the root cause for everything.  companies likes disney and warner bros  and even netflix   comics are all aware of that lgbt or gay community make up a very tiny portion of the population  if money was the only sole consideration in all of this  they would never put any gay characters ever in the show.  that will never or most likely not make any sustainable revenue  but they re obviously taking aspect or types of people in consideration. there not all money grabbing greedy piece of shits like most people claim them to be  they do care about money but they also want to promote some level of equality and representation for some group of people  create a level tolerance.  and yes they lose money overtime  but this is more doing the right thing then just follow the masses for more money.these are billions dollars companies  they will likely not make profit from time to time for making these movies but there still choosing to to do that over just money.its so hard to explain because Im assuming youre the type of person who wouldn t understand why  someone will do something that you feel is right if there isn t anything in return  like money.
they seriously count unsold comics to the sold number  thatsounds like a shitty practice. the sold counter should be what reached an end-user  and not what they managed to convince the shops for. itshould show the popularity  and not the bribes they can pay to have the big company buy it  then burn it later with the rest of the junk. in the end it is the income  that truly matters  and faking numbers   and reviews wont change that.
@akula doctor  I suppose that they justified it by saying that the comics had been sold to the retailer  though retailers could return a certain amount of unsold copies for a refund.  itstill seemed sketchy even then  but since the returns weren t coming in for a month after release the glowing release date numbers were the big push and the returns were not published at all  or in very small print in the back half of a report. they d boost their sold numbers with the limited edition special cover minimum order requirements too.  if a shop ordered x amount of a comic they could also get one copy of the special limited edition collectible cover.  so it became a risk game for stores.  for example  it might be  okay  Ive got ten guaranteed customers for this comic  but if I order fifty copies I can get this special cover which Imay be able to sell at a premium price to one of them.  I can return 25 copies in a month for a refund  so I ll have to keep fifteen copies that may not sell ever.  how much will thatspecial cover have to sell for to cover the losses on the fifteen Imay be stuck with    no comic book store had spare piles of cash lying around  so it was always a risky proposition.  especially if  as itsometimes turned out  half your guaranteed customers wanted the limited edition cover and half of those who didn t get it got pissed and closed their account costing the owner customers.  it was great for the release day numbers for dc  marvel  and others in the short term  but it ended up putting comic book stores out of business altogether once everyone was doing the special limited edition covers for half their popular titles.  it was a bad business practice  and it has only gotten worse from there.
thank you so much
john r. hughes was the actual inspiration for the lone ranger  even tho bass reeves was awesome as well.
I finished isom in three sittings  cant wait for isom 2.
Im bi. Im also a huge superman fan. I had no interest in this comic. just give me classic superman fighting supervillians.
I died laughing at the thought of old school lara croft saying   taxation is theft .
im glad I watched the cartoons back in the day and in hindsight that was pure luck as I didnt get hurt by all this stuff
I didn t see that  comply like heroes do.  thing in the past because I avoid twitter  but I just got a chuckle out of the idea of the heroes complying with thanos and saying  well  he has a point.
none of us 90s kids needed that crap.  this line alone got a subscribe from me.
I loved romance side in punisher.he loved his son and wife - they got killed and now he will murder all villains so no one will suffer like he is suffering.best romance in comics ever.
I acknoledge this will technically sound out of left field but for anyone who pays attention...Ive got a lot of respect for you that you do your videos fully dressed and not  in a thong  stockings and long dude t shirt.
Im surprised it lasted 18 issues.  sales peaked with issue  5 where he came out bisexual  Im not surprised it fell out of the top-50 pretty quickly thereafter as the shock-value and  must collect  value plummeted.
I remember when it was jhon and damian been kids and people absolutely loved it  then they aged jhon up and it was down hill from there   its my opinion that writers shouldn t be aloud to start messing with characters that are doing well.
old writers were so talented you didn t even know they were pushing an agenda.
lol I cannot believe how much I agree with this girl.  us 90 s kids didn t need that   hit  I love it. right off the cuff  too. seriously  agree 100  here!
entertainment is the only industry where the customer is always wrong and you dont have to give them what they want. Im happy to comply with the new paradigm...since I dont see myself in these properties anymore  Im out. maybe I ll go see maverick again this weekend
they could give away the comic to every audience member at the bros movie may help!
manga makes a variety of different stories  some are all romance  and some are all action. different stories appeal to different folks.
omg how could this happen     to such a good wellwritten character  faints
I blame this on english lessons in school. they were always going on about how stories highlighted this cultural thing or thatsocietal issue. and so  people nowadays think that in order for a story to be worthwhile  it needs to have some kind of message.but what english teachers failed to mention is that those classic stories that conveyed an important idea were ... you know ... good.
here s the thing  Im a massive romantic  I love the romance subplots in stories and everything Ive attempted to make has had integral romance plots. that being said  the romance subplots in most of these works are both unnecessary and poorly written.
this why people love manga
w
exactly!  those stories were great  two boys whose fathers are best friends tossed together  working out their own friendship. that was interesting.  so of course  somebody  several somebodies  had to ruin it.
excellent point about us not wanting our politics in entertainment either.
the most political things in isom would be when one of the characters is talking about city life compared to farm life and he somewhat promotes 2a and there s one drawing of eric where he wears a hat thatsays taxation is theft on it. still even with all of that there is nothing inherently political about the story that he tells and those examples I gave are very mild.
things aren t selling not because us as fans are  homophobic  but simply because we re just not gay. we dont care. we care about the relationships of our favorite heroes because we can relate and fantasize.
the worst part is every one of these terribly written characters just makes representation fail for everyone. isom does representation right. it has a diverse cast of characters  but focuses on being a good comic book story. as far as world issues go comics used to tackle them perfectly by doing itsubtly and using clever analogies that made great entertaining stories.
your videos have been popping up on my feed lately. I actually like what Ive been seeing. you just got a new subscriber
you ve said the most glaring truth. there is no need to pander to people that have no interest in your product. so  these new non-woke indie books are making millions  with almost no overhead  while the  mainstream  books are dead on the shelves. we are ready for new heroes. retire these old titles. print them no more. this is the actual death of superman. they did it to themselves.
hImelonie I hope you enjoyed your weekend thank you for alwaysbringing your thoughts  opions ontopics.I always enjoyed seeing your videos.takecare melonie
did you happen to see yellowflash s video on it  I would be be okay if you were on flashcast  just saying . he stated that first issue comics all have better sales and thats why they re trying to reboot it.
some european comics actually started off as propaganda  but grew into their own stories over time. tintin for example  I think alot of americans have heard of that one  since it got adapted by steven spielberg.kind of the reverse of what s happening now  good stories being turned into propaganda.
they didn t even get to the monkey pox plotline
it would be cool to see melonie on the critical drinker s podcast  she would be a nice addition.
shippers can be so toxic for fandoms regardless of what they are.
love this girl so much
to be fair  jason aaron s run of thor in 2012-2014 had thor opposed to roxxon on the basis of climate change and predatory monopoly and had mighty thor jane foster take up the fight against roxxon also. those were popular series.
Im glad I came across your video. it was really nice and your really fun.
precisely! we nerdy sorts use these mediums as a means to escape reality so as to better deal with it. d d for me has served that function for decades  and I am not down with the sjw garbage that wotc has been shoehorning into my beloved d d in recent times in the least. I dont want real world pc bs invading my mediums  thank you very much. Imake it a point to not include any such in my games when I run  and anybody I game with from now on will be told outright that Im not down with thatsickness. they can go play pc reindeer games elsewhere  just not in my gaming group. this is why nerdy things are dying  both from being trendy for the last ten years or so and from being corrupted with the woke virus. good on your parents for moving to tx  now what about you  would you consider moving to this fine state
bass reeves was a true 100  badasses badass.
hope the cat is cool with all those doggos about!
bruh your content is legitness haha glad I found your channel
Im not sure how much of a comic book person you are but you should definitely check out the bass reeves the guy was fucking amazing he s one of my favorite historical figures. and its also why I wrote him into my comic about time travel. the working title is. out of time
I respect this because at least you admit it. how do you think us gay people feel  I dont care about 99.9  of the relationships I see in films  tv shows  comic books because they re almost all straight.
Ive been on after hours twice now  super fun
@melonie mac go boom  my bad  I didn t know that  but Im really happy about it  and I will watch it for sure.
correct melonie there is no point in being seen if it fails but these comics were never about people seeing themselves in a character thats not what its about as we all know
okay  I dont want politics in entertainment either  but laura craft saying  taxation is theft  would be hilarious lol
I was born in 1997 and let me tell u the 90s was the best time period to be alive
melonie mac is definitely one of my top 10 favorite cutest youtuber critic atmgrrr
this is what happens when you make  sexuality  everything about your character.
happy to know your family will be closer    its one of those important things in life   have your loved ones around
x-men 1 is the only time such a marketing gimmick has worked. really well too
one thing thatstands out to me  much like the scooby doo cartoon story you ve been covering  is they know most parents dont monitor their children s entertainment that closely. kids will be reading gay superman because parents drop their kids off at the comic store while they go do other things  like a free baby-sitter . same thing with the cartoon... what s johnny doing  he s watching scooby doo... cool. the way they can keep a book like this going is they are removed from the customer. the comic shop orders the books sight unseen months in advance and they have to guess how many they can sell. furthermore they pressure the shops with gimmicks  if you buy 100 copies of the superman issue we ll send you the green plastic superman that everyone is going to really really want  that kind of thing. nerdrotic can explain it better than I because he s worked in the industry way more recently than I have. but it was getting to that in the 90s.
people have political opinions and thats fine but no one wants to see someone s personal political opinions be the primary focus of the story and feel forced to like it when they dont especially when it involves an entertainment genre which is supposed to be one s escape from reality
in the next time   in the meantime go boom  I like it
I still dont know what  go boom  is  but you won me over with taxation is theft. God bless you!
know your audience  tom
I doubt it will be missed  if even noticed.
too many writers today are turning themselves into the characters they re writing about  instead of writing about the actual character.
I really thought it would keep going for a while bc these people dont care about making money
now if we could get them to cancel the idea of doing this forever altogether
this is a relief!   woke  is one thing  taken too far  it becomes silly at best  idiotic and offensive at worst.   which applies to much  not merely  woke.
simple and why I got canceled  it was like itsaid pushing an agenda instead of it actually being entertainment and to tell the truth they could have done both but it went way too far on one side and they forgot the entertainment Im sure someone will come around that ll do it right so cant wait.
apparently the new superman series is a limited series  6 issues.  they are probably hoping to get a popular run on that and then keep it going.  plus they probably are just trying to throw taylor work.
I was going to comment  but you said what I was going to say at the end.  thank you!
stopping acting like gay people are inappropriate for kids to know scout. straight people can be comics and y all dont get concerned. just say youre homophobic
@billy hargrove  wow go off. I dont hate anyone. but to the average parent with all they see if hyper sexual activity from the gay community  I can understand why they do not want children expose to it. second throwing around homophobia to everyone who disagrees with you  cheapens the meaning . so when serious cases happens no one will care because they become desensitize to the word
the issue with fiction today is that it isn t allowed to fully be fictional.  escapism  which was a major if not the major component to fictional stories is damned today.  you always have to be reminded of current politics and social issues.  not only does it inhibit creativity  it also takes joy.
its funny how melonie mentions that the people that dc is pandering to does not read these comic books. all they care about are the pictures thatshow  representation   specific people kissing  or holding a flag. these people do not buy these comic books  because they just want the one picture to display to the world to feel represented. its never about the story  unless someone challenges them on what the story is actually about do they actually read the comic book.
men of culture   what we all gathered here for is at 10 42.
eric july- creates comic with story  heroic deeds  and a plot. sells more copies of issue 1 than all issues of justice league in 2020.
wow that book that no one was reading for canceledits almost like this has happened before to almost every woke comic with bad story telling and shallow characters
gay  straight  or whatever...truth to be no comic book is really safe and largely due to the sick state of comic book publishing which hasn t really recovered ever since the  comic book crash of the 90s. I am also worried about the long-term state of manga since many well known manga writers are up to advanced in age  retiring or have died. example being the fact guin sags and berserk haven t been the same since the passing of their authors
its not a cancellation. they are rebooting superman   adventures of superman with a new number one. john is apart of adventures.
this girl  damn I could get rich selling gamers dreams
hey melonie I was watching some of your older videos and your hair was straight  and it looked great. it looks good in your new videos as well  I was just curious if your no longer doing itstraight because this hair style is now part of your brand image  is it like tim pool s beanie  and now you feel like you cant change it
Im shocked! shocked! ...well  not thatshocked.
did dc figure out that  get woke go broke  is a thing finally   other than isom I haven t bought a comic in years and the politics is a huge part of why. I honestly doubt they ve learned the lesson tbh. we keep seeing marvel cancel underperforming woke books and bring back the same character and recycle the same writers. no reason yet to think dc will be different.I know melonies light makeup look wont last forever  but it is
hollywood prioritizes checking the  representation  boxes over creating good movies.
this is my shocked face.
melonie  romance in comics is boring and should be kept to a minimum  because nobody reads comics for the romance. the pulps  excuse me  thats it  hold my swashbuckle.
I love you  melonie! but you always look so sad.    everything alright
good points. I think things are getting out of hand with comics and other forms of entertainment in this way.on the topic of superman s son  I think that if they didn t overemphasize it and wrote it better  it wouldn t be a problem if he was gay. if they focused on the things that make a comic epic and all that  then the little bits of romance and development for his relationship  it would be fine. but they do all this stuff that ruins it and turns people away- like having john jr. protest climate change when he has the power to probably fix that.another thing I ll add is that  in my opinion  the reason the idea of john jr. being gay isn t as big a problem as the changes made to other characters recently is because he s a relatively new character who doesnt really have decades of being established as something else  I know we ve had superboy and other sons of clark kent  but thats sorta different . thanks if youread this.
probably a decade ago cw came out with the series  lost girl . while it was entertaining enough  the fact that over half of the major characters were part of the alphabet community really got on my nerves. I am seeing that a lot these days  they are a small fraction of the population but are demanding a lot of  representation  in entertainment.
like you said around 8 20  there s no point in being see if the material is trash .  thus  she hulk...
8 00 back in the 90s when I was about 10 my favourite xmen were a female southern bell that could kick your ass harder than any of the men  rogue  a african weather witch  storm  and a french man  gambit  yes I know he s from louisiana but he might well be french  and there I was as a white middle lower class english kid  Im pretty sure there was nothing of me in them characters but they were still my favourite  third place was actually a hard choice as eric magnus lehnsherr aka magneto is probably in my join second place but with him been an off and on bad guy I put gambit in  but even if I put magnus in there there still isn t much of me in there as Im not a holocaust survivor or at the time in my late 50s  if I was only going for something close to me ied have had to pick jubilee aka that annoying one that almost always needed to be saved as she was at least closer to my age  but no I liked the ones listed above and others like nightcrawler.
taxation is theft
comics needs to embrace the manga approach  aka real diversity  diversity of genre
my escapism game of choice back in the day is the legend of zelda ocarina of time. its my  1 favorite video game of all time.
ya know  making him gay and all that  the protests and stuff is a really cool for superman s kid  like klark gave up his us citizenship to save more people. like tim drake being gay in a recent batman comic was pretty cool because it gave us some of the most wholesome batman moments however itstarts to suck when it goes no further than that  even characters like bayonetta has a character so why do these characters get  im gay  and thats it.
great content!
she s exactly right ! I dont want politics in entertainment. I love sports that doesnt mean I need athletes telling me to vote!
if ur using a movie to send a message instead of tell a good story then maybe u can get some ppl who wouldn t otherwise be interested in it to see it but ppl are not gonna buy and continue to buy a full run of a comic book just because they agree with ur message if they dont already buy comic books
almost 5 k views in an hour. grats on the new channel!
its like they re using mandate over canon to write their fanfics. no hate on fanfics  I like them  but their charm is on the fact that they re not canon and are stories with full liberty to ship and follow any story that any individual fan could want  and whoever wants to read  can do so for free. but if any of it were canon  then its no longer fun  it loses the right to be dumb  shippy  and cringe.
retweets dont pay bills
jon kent is the new america chavez  push thatshit no matter how much it hurts the brand  then push harder because they cant dump bad characters development.
my favorite is the one sign saying  there is no planet b  in the protest image. at least make it make canonical since. in that universe there a lot of planet b s.
but...they cancelled the title and reloacated him as the primary character in another title they cant cancel...wheres the  win  in that !
tomb raider 2 and heart of darkness  two of my favorite all time games for playstation 1   thanks again! welcome to your parents to texas!
I love happy endings
yay for your family moving to texas!
this is something they did with captain marvel a lot.  new issue  1!  except they had to do it 12 times in the last decade to try and salvage the sales.
lol the way you speak is so adorable!
this I why Im a anime manga lover cuz I know it wont pander to  woke  politics
11 13  fetishization .  dang  I never looked at it that way. youre 100  right.
I think its funny that you kind of quickly glance over the fact that fast reads a real life us marshal inspired the character of the lone ranger or sent differently when they decided to tell the story of a black man in fiction they turned him into a white character. thatsort of thing had happened to black people for centuries  and Im glad you got to see it first hand so I dont want to hear any more complaints about white characters getting turned black.
uh-oh.new phrase alert  shippinggot a basic feel forrit but could somebody elaborate
never say never
having gay characters is woke  because you see alot of them in manga and anime
even if these  fans  do watch or play etc. they are between 1 -5   of the market. however they want their stories to be forced upon the 95-99  of the market  because they believe it is their purpose to re educate us all.
what makes someone a nerd is not what they enjoy  but how they enjoy it. true nerds do everything they canto immerse themselves into their favorite stories and worlds. they learn everything they can about the characters and lore  so that they can understand it as thoroughly as possible. this is what creates the respect that they have for their favorite hobbies. and it doesnt even have to be nerdy things you like. people that can recite every stat and fact about their favorite sports teams are really just as nerdy as any comic book fan that can do the same.this is why all these modern fans and creators are clearly not nerds  despite liking and making traditionally nerdy things. they never bother to dive any deeper than the shallowest levels. which is why they only care about who s kissing who  what color they are  and mundane politics  while ignoring the actual deep stories thatshould be being told underneath all that. they either dont want to put in the effort to learn about it  or are simply incapable of understanding it.most of the time  this isn t a problem. being a casual fan of something is still a legitimate way of enjoying it. you dont have to be able to write a thesis paper on every single game or show to be able to enjoy them at all. but  those casual fans cannot be allowed to have any creative control over the ip. they simply dont have the deep understanding or respect thats required to actually know how to make worthwhile changes. this is why gatekeeping is necessary to keep hobbies healthy.
noooooo say it ain t so it was so stunning and brave   .
this is why I have a drawer of old comics and graphic novels  it is not worth spending money on new comics   aside from isom and a few indies
there is a kryptonian God! clark kent is back!!
what many creators on the left side of things may never realize  given how they make sexuality sacrosanct  is that a fictional character s preference of who they want to have fictional sex with off panel just isn t that interesting.
comics have always commented on social issues but in days gone they did it in a subtle and non-preaching way. modern comic writers dont have anywhere near the required talent to do this and instead everything is done as tactlessly and patronisingly as possible.
.pissed myself on a spiritual level great vid.
right on  it really gets me when someone says  bet you wouldn t complain if it was the politics you agree with   Im like no I wouldn t because comic books  games  ect is not the place for it. people enjoy thatstuff to get away from that  not to be preach more about it.
a new coat of paint or a new coat of astroglide
the issue is making these changes canon. if it was limited runs  non-canonical  what if   stories  they could explore all of their woke issues knowing it was tailored to a very specific audience. pretending that its cool to rob fans of the canon they have connected to and supported for years  and then disparaging those fans for not getting on board  is what will bring down the franchises.look at it another way  if you could cater to the masses  you d have a big market. if you then pivoted to a niche market but still expected the masses to support you when though the product changed  is the problem with the masses or with you and your expectations
beautifulnas always
mark wahlberg voice   what  no !
I had high hopes for dark crisis. but I read a tie-in in young justice and that was the last time I read a comic completely. it was dismal.
well those people aren t even reading those comic books
glad I grew up with jony quest
yeah... calling b.s. on the  it got cancelled for politicizing comics  claim. superman has always been political  since his first depiction in action comics. no  the reason it cancelled was because it did it poorly. they artificially aged up superman s son  and in the process ruined the cool thing going on between the son of batman and the son of superman  with both heroes as dads bonding over their shared role  and declared  this is superman now.
finally  someone stopped this madness.
I am bisexual myself  and yet I didn t care about gay superman. I prefer whenever a character prefers whoever they want as long as it isn t their entire personality.
imagine the shock!
what youreally mean  gay characters and poc characters shouldn t exist in comics
you nerds forgot your place lol
when are you gonna realize that not everything is about sex  you can have relationships without sex being the main priority.
comics have always been political. batman has tons of stories involving corruption in the government and justice system
one of the few sensible comments in this entire thread
thats the crux of the matter. they dont seem able to tell stories in an organic manner.
the weirdest part to me is they pulled off an amazing story line and created characters that were gay in the past without it being the only thing you know about them.for example  apollo and midnighter. awesome heroes and story lines they shelved for some reason
I remember when only nerds read comics but because of the movies everybody wants to claim them as their own  but the woke crowd dont buy comics  but dc likes making lossess as a tax write offs for the parent company!
so on fucking point  mel.
Im not a homophobe  honestly  but I will admit that the disrespect and need to change our characters and their obnoxious attitude about it is starting to make me one.
unfortunately  it is not true. taylor tweeted a few hours ago that it is a 6 issue minI for a reason. that he cant spoil the nda but jon and by extension  his comics ain t going anywhere. so no  jon will continue. as he is superman as taylor says.
was monkey pox gay superman s kryptonite
when no one buys it  its typically future gold for collectors.
and then those same people are surprised that manga is doing better in the west.  I d rather read the boruto manga than read any dc or marvel comic out today.  fans want an escape from reality  fans want a story and interesting characters and development.  sexual orientation isn t even really a thought  its about the plot.  if you haven t picked up a manga yet or started an anime yet  bleach is a great start.
its hilarious in that pic of them holding the climate change signs  the kraken is wrecking things in the background
Im glad its getting cancelled.  Im an english teacher in korea and sometimes I show kids pictures on google for things like superheroes and it pissed me off that one of the first images to show up for superman is from this comic where he is kissing his boyfriend.  the kids were shocked and I had to quickly brush it off and change the topic or hero because of it. it pisses me off because I was trying to show them superman as a symbol of strength and hope which we were talking about in class as a topic and to have that image pop up pissed me off. dont ruin superman for younger generations with woke agenda shit dc.
these people dont understand the difference between romance and sex.
I d be fine with them undoing the character in the upcoming reboot as a whole.
who would have thought catering to an extremely small minority would lose the majorities interest
good move.  psueo superman that was forced upon the fan base. and we knee well in advance this was coming. we resist. stay strong men of steel!
aw music to my ears
calling people istaphobes may help them cope  but it doesnt help the bottom line
you know  exploring  woke  and  political  topics in comics isn t necessarily a bad thing and can be very interesting when handled well. captain america is a great example with that  Imean he literally fought in ww2  and the original civil war comic event explored the idea of freedom vs security and acted as a critique of the bush government  specifically its laws on surveillance . but what they re doing here is just virtue signaling  and it just comes across as self-righteous narcissism.
I dont like politics being brought up  even if I generally agree with what s being said  outside of politically focused content because I am very specific about my politics and am very sensitive to poorly or partially articulated positions that usually do nothing more than leave a bad impression on people who dont already agree with the stated position... also I hate pandering  which 99  of politics inserted in unrelated media-- i.e. all modern entertainment-- is.
they made the last son of krypton have a last son in progeny. dc became superman s ultimate nemesis.
one day of that nonsense was one too many and it wasn t even original material. the writer couldn t have expected this to take off since that kind of material only caters to maybe 5  of the population at best. the original creators of disney  marvel and dc comics have to be turning in their grave right now. it always seems like when the original creator dies and someone takes over all the content that is created from that point usually tends to be very subpar.
they already had the earth hero s or avengers that did the whole save the recycling planet thing
yes
if the comics  haters  have more content knowledge of the comic book series after reading compared to the comic books supporters who probably have not read the comic should be explanatory enough as to why it got canceled.
there s a reason manga has been outselling american comics for years
twitter checkmarks  I need to be represented  meanwhile boys in the 90s looking up to optimus prime a literal robot.
now we  the fans of comicbooks  should give them hard time for canceling it and how homophobic is that! xd
bruh moment.
reason is manga destroying american woke comics and its fantastic
honestly I dont see the problem with gay superman  it is just one of manny variants of the character. we even seen a more extreme different version of him where he landed up in the soviet union and was raised by stalin until he took over the ussr and became an enemy of the united states for being a communist. it even has a soviet batman who is so counter revolutionary that he kills innocent people who identify as communist
whoever wrote the supposed new tomb raider leak of a lesbian lara croft needs to see this.
not cancelled. jon kent s solo title is being renamed  adventures of superman  jon kent . so jon has an iconic superman series to himself and to include his name in the title. as for sales  let s check what the  1 selling comic is on amazon right now  oh.try reporting facts.-tom taylor well that was a fun 2 days of disinformation.
Imean they did not make superman  kal-el   gay  they made his son bisexual.
the thing is tom taylor can actually write pretty well. but he completely dropped the ball on superman  son of kal-el. I didn t and still dont mind that jon kent is gay but the writing was just that bad to me. I dont know. I did try reading it multiple times to give it a chance but I just couldn t
Im the first to call superman lame at every chance. I ll also be the first to admit  they did his son dirtier than my jokes.
this fan never gave it a second thought after I heard about the nonsense. just passed on it from the jump. they can put all the bs out they want. doesnt mena anyone has to buy into it.
good God  what are they going to try to destroy next  I was going to make some suggestions  but I hate to give these wokester warriors any new possibilities.
cant wait to some day see lara croft holding a sign thatsays  eat meat  while driving a massive v8 muscle car.
here s the sad thing.its one thing to have an lgbtq  character thats not out to push an agenda  and have people like that character  because the writers took the time to flesh the character out beforehand  and give the reader audience some time to understand and relate to the character. the one thing you could easily spot back in the late 90s and early 2000s  was when it was being done to be trendy  but this is far more than that.  its another thing to slap a brand new lgbtq  character into a medium where the writers did zero backstory fleshing out build up  besides  this person is fabulous!  and then start giving themselves a high five for inserting their character and their politics into this medium  and then promoting this character because they re lgbtq  instead of things like storyboarding  art quality  writing quality  character development  or any other myriad of things thatshould matter and then raise a fit when people dont like the character.nowadays  someone gets their hands on a property and they ve already got their head canon of who this person is  and what it is  or who it is they do... and all of a sudden  there s politics every-fucking-where. like the critical drinker said in one of his videos  and Im paraphrasing here   we turn to entertainment to escape from the everyday bullshit we deal with in regards to politics  why would we want to deal with it in our entertainment too !
I dont want samus aran do a screw attack and look at the camera and say 2a is why I have chozo arm cannon.
alright new video!
romance is good filler for a motion picture or even a 60-minute series. it really doesnt add much to a c.o.m.i.c. book.
long live the rippaverse!
rofl!
bahaha forreal
I predict that tom taylor s next project will be some similar garbage.  as long as they keep these people who do not make comics that people want  but are more into their social political messaging  there is no hope for dc and marvel comics
the dc staff can bend to the whims of the church of twitter all they want to stroke their ego  but at the end of the day  if the sales numbers dont bend to the whims of ceo david zaslav   they ll have all the time they need to promote their politics and causes elsewhere.
another great video appreciate your view
dc is canceling  wokeman  finally took them 18 issues too long  or they are putting it on hiatus temporarily which never sells because  everything woke turns to   dc stands for dead company plus  muckfarvel which is why anime manga are kicking ass
I thought he was supposed to be bi. he mustn t have been able to leap over something  if ya know what Imean .
imagine that.  an established fan base is given something different than what they were a fan of and expected to buy it.  project fails.  fans are blamed when they dont play the social commentary game.  its almost as if not acknowledging your core customer fails or something.  Im all for diverse characters   but it doesnt work when you change what works.  you have to build from the ground up on new characters stories world building  establish them with good writing and taking your time before people are going to take to them.  just slapping labels on things is not appealing and doesnt work.
we all have our biases. its best to just admit it. you may claim you dont want lara to claim  taxation is theft  - by the way  its taxation that finances your own survival via police force  military  etc - but you would love it if she  showed  it.
yes thank God.
its almost like things that are twitter-popular are not actually popular with the general public.
imagine my shock
to me the worst part isn t just that they made superman gay. its the fact that they aged jonathan kent up out of nowhere so that he could take up the superman mantle and then made him gay just so they can say  superman is gay now . jon was just a kid just recently and it was too short lived  so he didn t even get to keep his innocence. but then again it makes sense because the lgbt community does love going after the kids and trying to influence them into conforming to their ways. like the great eric july says  dc stands for dead company. and they ll stay dead as long as they continue to hire hack writers that are only worried about shoving their message down our throats.
snyderverse.  a group of people wanted their alternate vision of the dc comics made  and they pushed very hard for it. movies were made  and failed to connect with the larger audience and were financially failures  go  snyderverse go broke .  a subset of the snyderverse group were are very demanding  aggressive in pushing their view forward  and want it all to conform to their view values.   this group will give endless reasons and explanations for why it is everyone else that is problem for this.  so will go so far as to claim it didn t fail.  their are conspiracy s abroad.while I am sure there is part of the fan base that wants to see a gay superman with a social agenda  I would suspect it isn t very large.  the truth is that if you sell a product thatspecifically caters to a subset of the consumer base  there is a likelihood the majority of the base will show little interest.  if you make a product and it doesnt sell to your consumer base  new coke  the issue is not with the consumer  but with the creator.
superman doesnt solve problems anymore. he goes on a protest march with all the other hopeless.
the question I always have is - why why is everything focused on sexual orientation  targeting kids which is disgusting  instead of creating quality products
super man could change climate all on his own
comic books have been used for propaganda purposes for a long time though. check out some of the early  wartime issues of superman for example  during ww2 .I guess this is why Ive never really taken to the caped crusader comic books at all really. the industry is just so abysmally low on artistic integrity.I like the comic book medium  but its taken up by so much high budgeted crap.
so they didn t cancel it because he s gay it was cancelled because they made him a politically based and pushed ideals on the reader  if thats the case I dont really blame it go ahead and cancel that! comics movies games books etc. are meant for escapism dont go pull too much of real life issues into our retreats especially not piling them up on one character!
I dont buy it for the same reason I dont buy romance novels.
did anyone really think this book would last   all its defenders did was say that this character was is gay  not any significant storylines he was involved in  major villains fought  milestones he accomplished.  willing to bet that those who defended this character   were hyping him up didn t buy more then one or 2 issues.
wait what they tried to make superman gay   the day they try to make batman gay is when I go to war.
john was aged up before he was bI  and was in a herero relationship with a grown women before he got with a guy. so stop pushing this narrative when you dont know the facts
@gem3l  I didn t know thatso thats my mistake. but it doesnt mean Im wrong about his time as a kid still being too short lived and about the lgbtq agenda.
@akil brazier  do you know how many new character ever have any staying power in the industry  y all wont buy new character comics because to you guys new  change and y all hate it. using older characters is much more successful.
@gem3l  thats not true but ok. the only change I dont like is changing of already existing characters. new characters have to be given time and be marketed well and have appeal to them to last. literally every character in comics now were new characters at one point. and they ve had staying power because  obviously  they re still here. new characters have to grow a fan base and writers have to simply make these characters interesting and fans will gravitate toward them.
@akil brazier let s talk about the new wonder girl that was cancelled from low sells. even with previous legacy titles they dont last long. comics as a whole is declining as the prices for books are rising. so they stick with old character which will give them the money they need and not waste on new characters that wont last.
its not just the progressive agenda that bugs me about these properties  but taking what could be a great live-action version of a comic and ramping up the adult content of language and sex just cause it goes on to a platform where its allowed is just too much. they re replacing good writing with gimics that have no purpose beyond their shock value. the example that comes to my mind immediately is teen titans on hbo max. I recall years ago seeing the trailer and the swearing and thinking that I immediately had no interest. then we recently got hbo and I thought I would check it out in case I judged it too harshly. nope  I was correct from my initial reaction. can we not have clean content that has to stand on the ability of people to write well  the animated batman series from the 90s is a great example of that. I remember watching some behind-the-scenes interviews a long time ago and how the writers were actually forced to write things better because they were restricted by the level of censorship the show had to go through. its sad to think that the show wouldn t have been as good if it didn t have those rules to follow.
when I imagined  superman vs a black hole  this definitely was not what came to mind.  imagine being so narcissistic that you thought it was ok to subvert a nearly 100 year old franchise to virtue signal.  hopefully you cant imagine that  because if you can  youre probably just the worst.
they re just   br s
why not just make a gay kryptonian character from scratch with their own archetype backstory and virtues  because that would wound less people.
I got three words for you  womp womp.
I didn t buy it because I have no interest in comics even if its a gay one. but I do like that fact that unlike other attempts at a gay super heros jon kent seems to be the most normal one. even if he s coming from a place of pandering its  barely better then coming from a place of ridicule.
one thing about the comic book industry  its main target audience are teenager boys  and this means dad and mom pay for them.  if you want to virtue signal irresponsible  woke values  then that is a broke path of decay  and a bad reputation.  it is simple  without a moral righteousness and light in the superheroes  then they are little different from the supervillains   a bunch of overpowered people who dont answer the sheriff.  although  because of the target audience  one naked butt on harley quinn  who already walks the dark side  would be a collectable  and could turn into a poster.
oh thank God!
the only good thing about the series was the comic book debut of dreamer
ok.. Im just sayin... I could watch you do that  taxation is theft  move.. many a time over and over.. just sayin.. that was pretty damn good... and hot.. and it was a good message.. taxation is theft.. @10 40.
Im pretty firmly on the left.I strongly believe in doing everything we canto stop and repair climate change.I have kids in the lgbtq community and support my kids and that community.and yet.I wouldn t touch this comic with a 10  woke pole.why whatever activist efforts Imake on behalf of climate or lgbtq or whatever else  I enjoy entertainment as escapism to avoid the harsh realities of the real world  not to indulge in them.I dont want actiivist agenda in my entertainment  even if I support their activism.take itsomewhere else and just let me be entertained for a while.
funny how comic publishers change their core characters to please certain  small  segments of the public  yet their sales tank. they should have known that their complainers dont read comics. you tried to appeal to people who would never read your books.
oh  really  I suppose selling only hundreds of issues  total  isn t what they expected to happen.  p
melonie is gorgeous  Im glad I stopped reading dc and marvel
people on twitter dont have money  its why they are using twitter all day.
even if the audience is  homophobic  they are completely within their rights to be so.
I bet itsold horribly from day one  but dc kept the dumpster burning just like a kid plants his feet on the ground when throwing a tantrum. the level of cringe on this series is above classification  really  its a whole new level of absute shit!    I wish one day I ll have the chance to personally trigger the author  and with personally Imean in person  it would be so much fun!!!
I am shocked  shocked! well not thatshocked.
climate change is a serious issue  but if youre superman with access to super-science  you can offer a little more help than just walking with a sign above your head. say  offer to help buy time until the people in charge actually get the numbers down instead of hoping for the best until that happens
the superman brand has been damaged beyond repair
why are they messing with well established and loved properties  why dont they just invent characters tailored for a particular crowd  Ive never heard any lbgt people complain about superman  its a comic. I do admit that the gay characters they had  cant recall the cowboy.... are way too silly. like saying  girlfriend!  stuff like that. gay super hero cowboy wouldn t talk like a fashionista from  devil wears prada . too much inclusion just makes everything bland and goofy.being a kid from the 90 s too  I agree with what you are saying
Im glad Im not the only that wont miss gay superman.I just never could imagine gay superman fighting with the same ferocious necessity to achieve victory  as one that knows if he fails  then he failed lois.I dont think the writers behind this failure ever understand superman s true motive. saving the climate certainly isn t one of them.I hated the idea of superman without the lois lane arc.
I always    tht underdsr
remember when comic was about enjoying the story telling with no political agendas  marvel   dc destroyed my beloved hobby with their political agendas so I hit them where it hurts the most   their wallets. used to read comics religiously back in 80 s and 90 s but with all the bullshits they ve been putting out   I had to stop.
how many times did you try and fix your hair in this video
the question being begged by dc and their supes  both superheroes and supervillains  is why do people buy their comic books  and watch their cartoons  animation  and motion pictures   the human mind has a million years of evolution  and inside our brains are everything that we can do  try something  and see if you actually have a talent that you can unlock in your brain.  this means  the superheroes root out the snake nests to be valued to society  the snakes are undesirable elements of the environment   and this is an ancient warrior duty  because they are valued by defending society and going to war against the enemy.  in addition  for the supervillains  we need to know who the enemy is  and the human mind will spend 1.6-times longer memorizing a face of an evil-doer over someone else  this is why supervillains can have comic books and motion picture moments  but not as often  as they populate dr. carl jung s shadow of the mind.  this means our values are utterly inside our brains  and this also means they are unconscious processes of the mind.  if you start misrepresenting the superheroes  then the mind instinctively re-categorizes them as something else  including possible snakes in the grass or monsters.  this is why virtue signalling is so false  because there are truth and consequences in reality  where telling people that they are evil-doers for farming and eating means you want to harm them  this is happening today  look at norway and its ecology restriction that attacked all farmers for growing the food   and the human brain does recognize this  including in irresponsible woke people  and then the mind turns away.  go woke  go broke.
I would cringe if wb made an superman and superman randomly  yelled maga. because I want to see superman save people and punch giant robots.
well I could understand ultraman with his  beta capsule  but superman is just too far
my dearest melonie mac  its not just your exterior beauty that is so intoxicatingly hypnotizing  but your range of logic and reason that I find absolutely irresistible. keep shining the light on agenda-biased politically driven social media propaganda! go boom!!!
what were they thinking  grooming   brainwashing and indoctrination perhaps
yes girl! preach! we 90s kids didn t need this shit. I just want great characters  a compelling story  and everything else such as sexual orientation  was on the back burner.
its not just that its a bad comic book. we dont want a flamboyant superman.
never understand why these companies push their political views in their products when their sole purpose is to make as much money as possible.
twitter dont buy comics... there s a 20 80 rule that brands have long gone forgotten about. I love inclusion and diversity  but not at the cost of characters or story....
go woke  go broke.     cant wait for those new scooby doo and velma shows...
I agree with most of your points you brought up. disagree on a few. even as a 90s kid I dont think representation is bad  is it needed if itshifts the story or characters though   no it isn t . also dont think the romance isn t needed in comics as it adds a bit of realism and allows you to empathize with them which can add to the story but only if done for the right reasons in the story  not to pander  that being the worst reason. usually things added to any form of art that have no real passion behind them tend to tear down the rest of the piece  but I guess the phrase beauty is in the eye of the beholder works just about everywhere  however I dont think anyone should try to force their idea of beauty onto anyone as well. glad to see something fail for trying to encapsulate only 1 part of society and not the part that partakes in this form of media and art mainly  they should really try to add to stories with the characters as they are rather than changing them too much. thanks for the video melonie mac go boom!
gee its almost like turning on your audience and pandering to people that are not interested in purchasing your product isn t a smart business practice. if only there were dozens of other examples of this so that people would learn to focus on the quality of their product as opposed to purely pushing a political ideology.
first and foremost  your beautiful  .... Imean good video.  thats why anime overwhelming western comics. they far to concern about  the message . making good stories and profit is not that important
I dont understand why the dc version of earth needs any sort of activism over climate change. all sorts of alien technology and all sorts of magic can right the climate right away.
its... thuperman!
this coming from a maga supporter
to be honest I like to see that youtubers like yourself are so offended by a character being gay  bI  lesbian  black mixed race or any type of race besides white. because they go against your view point u ll let miles morales live because he agrees with your views he likes girls so thats good  but the biggest thing of all that I love about you youtubers is that youre so sensitive to the subject of  a character isn t straight  ull cry and make hounds of videos just about something u dont agree with. and when people give you criticisms that cause snowflakes  social justice warriors or the woke crowd
oh no! how could they do that!  as a gay man Im really gonna miss the feminine woke insulting shallow comic that the super ally and saviour of the lgbtqaI        community tom taylor created.
oh no ... anyway.
is it true people actually try and roleplay in over watch during overwatch matches   I seen this said from someone I forgot where I read it but this genuine overwatch player was talking about how overwatch sucks now  idk just restating what he said I dont play overwatch  and then he said  theirs twitter woke users trying to have a roleplay session during a public match!  and I was dying laughing because how can you even roleplay in overwatch  I like to roleplay in mmos dont get wrong and not bashing all role players but we can all agree thats ridiculous  roleplay is fun but there s a time and place for it and not every game supports it and even if you wanna roleplay why be in a public match   any overwatch players mind telling me is this true  like where the fuck would they even roleplay at
should gay superman actually be called  pooperman
the problem with sjw and woke culture is that its incredibly hypocritical at its core. these people reject their native culture and interests and instead virtue signal and attack anyone else for their culture. they have no problem attacking anyone for perceived cultural appropriation  but they dont realize the fact thats exactly what they are doing. they take parts of western white men nerd culture and cannibalize it for their own use. they have no problem creating outrage about teens wearing chinese dresses to proms or hats at festivals  but at the same time they turn around and take apart a whole industry for their own purpose  to propagate a message that no one but themselves is interested in. they infiltrated hollywood and comic industries  infected them with their political correctness  when they never respected or liked the culture that originally brought money to these industries  and now they are trying to spread their agenda like a disease  disregarding the lack of profits or interest from the masses.they dont build something from the ground up and use that  either because they tried and failed or didn t even try and just demand to be given a voice and be tolerated. but now its no longer about tolerance  it is about dominance  dominance over white men  women breeding people  over nerd white culture and over anything that is not their own interest. it is no longer a message of equality  its a message of narcissism and intolerance of anything that isn t them.
truth  justice  and the american way.its not just some pointless catchphrase  its everything superman stands for.
why  would  he need to wear a mask  if bullets  no oxygen  extremely  cold or  hot temperatures  cant  hurt  him
why is someone calling himself superman  a character who has Godlike powers and can combat natural disasters like its nothing  protesting climate change instead of stopping those giant tentacles of the humungous octopus squid back there from potentially harming the people walking on the dockside this isn t a superhero story  this is a more boring archie comic nobody wanted with characters in superhero cosplay!
pretending ... whaaaaaaaaaat  ! !why  this is the best woke superman  ! !
this is like the bros movie  which apparently was actually funny says amanda the jedI . even if the comic is good  your target demographic is too small or even non-existent. and at the end of the day  the only thing that matters is the bottom-line.
I dont think people are homophobic for not buying this comic book  but I do think people who object to gay characters being included in comic books are homophobic. Im gay and I read comics - there are plenty of us. youre right us 90s kids didn t demand representation - because it didn t exist. however  it would have been great to have had representation. a lot of straight people dont get it because they re constantly represented so its just normal to them. if you at least try to see it from someone else s point of view you might be a little more enlightened.
taxation is theft. but  would be a good change from the usual trash  melanie.
Im gay but I dont need to see myself represented by existing characters. I eyeroll every time an existing character has some characteristic crowbarred in for diversity points. race swap  gender swap  sexuality swap  and it always comes off as a cheap gimmick. for the most part being gay in the west is socially accepted  this comic isn t created for countries where being gay is punishable by death  let s face it  I think we ll get by without superman becoming gay. I hate how its then conflated with homophobia. no  I dont think most people would care about some new superhero being gay honestly.
oh no  anyway I ll dance celebrating its cancellation
its weird that you people are so obsessed and flustered about stuff like this
superman buggars flash next. the superman -flash affair no.1
they turned superman into captain planet
shouldn t have even left the drawing board. this is 18 issues too many.
I always thought superman was supposed to be gay anyway  so...
7 47 lol!
this country has to come back to some sort of  sanity and rid ourselves from  wokism  and political correctness
they dont care about the failure if they push the agenda
hey  woke comicbook publishers had to run out of money and profits at some point
trying to force a new issue  1 is so embarrassing
go woke   go broke
its inevitable
never heard of this superman but the whole mask thing. just way too extra.
I just dont understand the mindset of people anymore. who wanted this  who asked for this
cant they just make a whole new character gay
the new tomb raider...laura   wow  your security really sucks here... maybe you should ve built a wall... like a big wall  thatsomeone else pays for... make mexico pay for the wall or Im gonna do some grave robbing up in this house!
imagine turning arguably the most famous super hero gay to please less than 5  of the human population and thinking its a good idea...
thank God
was not that character ten years old or whatever  this smells like typical hollywood  method  to me.
thats what im talking about
its only getting cancelled so they can sell another  1.
when you make a movie comic book etc. etc. get woke go broke and it flops then blame everybody you defo have issues.........well thats the industry today so I say lets just cheer em on keep making flops lose billions while we just keep laughing until it finally gets back to the good old days where they make content for everyone not just 10  of america
lol. but to be fair  the only thing thatsells over at dc are batman comics.
super monkey pox.
gay superman is cancelled                  how dare you   how dare you
superman use your bussy to stop lex luthor
tell me about abomb with out a comic list
Im extremely surprised that there is not  in fact  a market for gay superman. shocking.
90s kid here agrees!!
something tells me its gonna take a lot more than kryptonite to take down a gay superman.
superman wasn t gay at all .
I gotta ask are you into punk or metal or hardcore at all
its supposed to be the adventure
another one bites the pillow Imean dust
thats just so sa.... hahahahahahahaha
pretty sure anna  doesnt want you in he space
dc comics has learned that nobody wants woke media anymore.
everybody knew this would fail - everybody  even dc and taylor  so why do it
they pander to a non-existent fanbase  they deserve to fail.
john had so much potential as teen superman together with damian   then some dude rush to growing up... im ok john been gay but make that the all focus was so bad
hI everyone!!!
yknow  as a gay man  I wouldnt mind a gay superman story......as long as it wasnt full to the brim with woke bullshit. it honestly saddens me that what could be decent stories get ruined by politics.
they knew they could never turn clark gay so they turned his son gay even tho he had many years in comics and never showed any thing other then being straight. they wanted to do this to get younger fans woke agenda etc. but nope sales plummeted people get tired of you turning establish hero s gay black just make new heroes damn it.
people how buy comics is not on twitter.
yes  I almost exclusively listen to rock  metal  and punk. and kpop sometimes
@melonie mac go boom  hell yeah  hey idk if you know who me first and the gimme gimmes are  but they re an awesome punk band they do cover songs. like if old music they cover boyz 2 men  john denver  diana ross  elton john  all kinds of shit. listen to their cover of I will survive if u have a minute. it has fat mike and joey cape  jory sings in lagwagon  and fat mike  obviously  sings in nofx lol if u already know them I apologize but they re my favorite band  their vocalist  spike  is the best punk singer in the world.enjoy!
mac go boom 2024
best version of this gay shipping was spiderman and deadpool
who could have forseen this  . dc trying to reboot bent kent   k-pop to get a sales bump will work for one issue  then the sales will fall off a cliff and crater deeper than the marianas trench. meanwhile sales for manga at an all-time high and still growing.
1 19 why not just use his ice breath to rebuild melted glaciers  problem solved
dark angel was  20 years ago
most things now they take the entertainment take out entertain and replace it with its suppose  to push an agenda and if you dont like being lectured your a bad person ment so when something new to watch or read comes out Imost likely skeptical of it
if they had any talent they wd write an original character   make him whatever they like. must there be a gay make out scene in every show
and nothing of value was lost.
superman s kid being gay I can accept... but why did they pair him up with a pink haired nerd  he should be with an absolute giga chad. he s superman.
david zaslav  the new warner bros ceo is great! cancelling all their woke stuff from movies to comics. its about time!
look up in the sky! its a turd its a stain! its been cancelled!
authors and writers nowadays need to step self inserting themselves in stories. youre not stan lee!
tbh I do not understand how anything related to climate change can happen in the dc universe. superman can just freeze the ice caps. how canthey not think about that
superman son of kal el get woke go broke to adventures of jon kent other ways to get woke go broke lmmfao
love you
check esg ratings. they stand for environmental  social and governance ratings. and they are really being used by a lot of companies to attract investors that believe in such rating system  which was put in place essentially to try and avoid governmental intervention - companies can say  hey look we are already doing good things for the world  . in reality its just marketing. it does not come from a place of real care. I do not oppose bringing socially relevant topics into comics and other types of media at all. in reality I think its obvious we should have them so that realconversations can happen and things stop being a taboo - and ultimately people stop suffering.but why not create new stories  that come from a place of truth by doing so  well  writing a compelling story and good characters with engaging motifs and arcs is actually not easy at all  and talent and skill to do so does not abound.so companies take the easy way. they dont really care about change. but money. and getting it as fast as possible. so they hire talent - sometimes based on quotas indeed - and push for  re-adjusting  already existing stories and franchises  because they think the risk is lower when compared with bringing new content  even if they have writers and creators already hired that could bring their real experiences into crafting such new genuine stories.I really hope that comic creators - be it right or left wing  whatever their sexual orientation or gender is  no matter their cultural background or ethnicity is - start producing comics by themselves and selling it directly to the people  the readers.so everyone can read what they want  new stories. instead of being fed what companies want just to fill in some abstract rating system that translates directly into millions in investment and as such verges on being a wide scale scam.
90 s kid  you look way to young to be anyone who grew up in the 90 s.
wow that was fast
oh no what a shame. the bastardization of an already established character was rejected. what a shocker!
lol
why is it called  ships   how did this term come about. sorry  Im an old gen xer.
only makes sense  after all  moving on from affleck meant cancelling gay batman
oh no! anyways
cant stand stupid ass politics in the media I consume.
glad this got canceled. I dont have issue with someone s sexual orientation  its none of my business  but please dont mess with a previously established character and ruin them or change them.
Imean. majority of the non comic readers are mostly female  same goes for gaming  well most games are mostly males who partakes. when it comes to focus on inclusivity and being vocal about it  mostly females than men. thats the audience the media tries to sale and pander towards. which is also the same reason why the sales doesnt go that well. for one people are getting fed up about itso the sales trick has dried up.
maybe both dc and marvel have to research about their market. I bet they want to make money. so how many people who buy comics  in every community must have their own charts. so if u want make big money. make a story that the majority love. because you will lose your big market if not fits with the majority.
oh  no! anyway
10 42 is hot. yeah this was nonsense and they wanted to tie superman over it just to get the guy who wrote it headlines. huge failure to no ones surprise and putting his son who was a kid with the ugliest looking character is shameful.
was jonathan kent jr always gay or did dc comics made him gay for no reason
why    why must our whole society cater to a small percentage of the population   and I was shocked at how small it is because the level of noise this particular group   gay men  makes seems unreal. all the various minority groups   racial  sexual and socio-economic    are always ready to spout bs about hown oppressed they are and demand that they get  representation ! .  yet they  seem to grab much more than their fair share and invariably get over represented no matter what the job or role is.ps    of course when you aim at such a small group how can you expect sales to be anything other small. after all you d expect a the customers to be the same or similar percentage of the general customer base. so if gay men make up 5  of the superman audience you d likely see about 5  of the regular sales with plus or minus depending on how good the story is.
comics have been used for propaganda for a long time  though thats not really new.
if they are cancelling gay superman shouldn t the comic company be cancelled for  erasing  gay history  lol
I just cant figure out why all the straight Christians aren t flocking to the comic store to buy gay superman. they loved the old super man so much! its just a mystery to me.
actually  bisexual.
they target 1  of the population and the gay community have standards as well for decent entertainment so its more like 0.000000000001
there letting people fail upwards  gross.
oh no! anyway
uhmm... why dc still calling it as  superman  when he is not a  man  anymore ...
could we maybe just stop putting relationship stuff in superhero comics   I really couldn t care less about it  regardless of what their supposed sexual preference is.  their personal lives are not what Im reading comics for.
there is no reason superman should have a gay storyline.
I have no problem with a gay superman!!!  wait   was he a top or bottom
do you even read comics or...just grab one and say go boom frosk
hey houston texan here where in texas are your parents looking to move to
it is cancelled because no body purchased it....by the way politics has always been a part of main stream comics... from the civil war to the fight for equal rights to women s rights has always found its expression in the comics!
I wonder what you do if youre gay- you get any special powers  you are faster  better eyesight  soon we will know
this demographic they keep trying to pander to and stick it to the right. they get money from neither audience
yes cancel it!!!
supergayman. not my thing.
supergay is cancelled. shocker!!
w melonie
the series lasted for a year  Im surprised it lasted that long itshould have lasted a month and Im being kind for saying that. I knew it wouldn t last. I knew it was a bad idea ppl who read comics there are still ppl who read comics wanna be entertained.they dont wanna be lectured by having this woke trash shoved down our throats I never read this garbage and I never will I never called jon kent superman and I never will I have another name for him trust me you dont wanna know good-bye mr.truth  justice and a better tomorrow. there s only one superman and its not jon kent. we got the real superman defender of truth justice and the american way!
I honestly thought this comic got canceled awhile ago it looked like trash then and itstill does now
is your hair naturally curly.
like superman was never gay bro just make a new damn character! how hard is it. to the woke very hard they are  my new comic super glizzygobbler!
gay superman   comedy writes itself.
why dont they make there own superheroes and not steal from a franchise. o yeah thats right they dont make alot of money that way.
imagine losing your ass financially just to virtue signal.
thats sad I was a little hopeful  but mostly curious how horrible it would be
dallas area  where Im at
yup  Ive been wearing it natural again for the past few months
@melonie mac go boom  ah cool. I remember your hair was straight in old videos. thanks for the response.
they did with jon but they handled jon terribly
melonie w mac
no doubt tom taylor will continue to fail upwards
good  its canceled  now can we make the comic books for the fans and not people that dont read comics at all
this has become a big problem  its crazy where we are now  with all this.
thank God! get woke go broke!
superman rescue undocumented immigrantsuntil those immigrants dropped in front of his fortress of solitudethen he will kick them all out
oh no .anyways
making them all gay wont make up for crap writing
indoctrination through entertainment. this is why snl jumped the shark.
oh no......anyway.....
dc is canceling it because no one is buying it.
im shock well not really.
this crap doesnt sell. it is beyond clear that there is no market for this to be profitable. once again  facts over feelings
couldn t superman fight climate change with his super breath  or flying to space to drop off ice comets  maybe helping to construct a space parasol  all options better than holding up a sissy sign...
speaking about climate change  does anyone remember the captain planet cartoon series  lol
superman has always been woke  gay characters aren t new for comics  and you cant  turn  a character gay if they were too young to be sexualized before they aged up and came out.
not enough  gay  12 year olds
if it had been a good book  and only made him gay  and it was just a thing in the book  it would have sold.  particularly if good ole hetero supes was still around to give people their traditional supes fix.  but then they had to also put in woke stories  which doomed it.  the fact that it was also badly written to force those stories  well.......
called it.. it didn t appeal to any real known fanbase that would actually be able to support it.
make their own movies or comics or books but stop taking things already written and changing it for politics and then complain when it loses money.
still find it funny that captain planets weakness was pollution when his whole purpose is fighting pollution  dont know why kwame even bothers calling him
a lot of these woke comics are getting pay from the esg to make this woke garbage they are not getting paid from the customer the esg is what paying them
I am gonna tell you  how to make thus a 1  okokok take super gi-rl  and change her with kara ..see what I did dere ! now  do not have any sex or innuendos just....write a story with nice poses. next try out new armor in her something thatsnaps with fans. thenjust for the gays. have her compete with other suoerheroes for the best sturdiest eye-catching fireproof armor. that way. you dont hafta fight. your best artist get their practice  future books can use this research. and it is kara zorel.....duh....
there s no planet b  lol there is literally other planets and interstellar travel in the dc world
0 13 yuck
ummmmmmmmmmmmmmgo boom
too supergay
vanity project with minority appeal. investors bought the first one but unlikely to profit from this
if you search tom mix is the inspiration for the lone ranger not bass still a great guy but not true
propaganda is the word for it
about damn time! now they just gotta get rid of gay tim drake and hopefully marvel can stop embarrassing ice man too. bottom line  stop force inserting politics and virtue signaling in comic books. respect legacy characters  if you want have  lgbtq-xyz  representation  create new characters. if you want said characters to succeed or appeal to a wider audience  dont write them like the worst  most ridiculous stereotypes you canthink of. like ice-man  who s not gay  never been gay  and used to be a genuinely cool character. the same thing goes for race swapping  etc.
does the lgbtq community even read comics   if not   who was this made for
this isn t surprising  superman has been used for propaganda since the beginning. look at the many propaganda posters featuring superman and batman from world war 2. dont look at them if youre easily offended though.
I prefer reading clark kent and bruce wayne comics than this.note  I have nothing against gay people in general
this is just the normal playbook. they release cheesy and cringy stuff. children are none the wiser think its just for fun. then  move on and grow. unfortunately  they are bombarded by morons this day and age. making it way more difficult.
this needed to be cancelled glad that it is
people want to watch old school stories of good vs evil. they are tired of woke shit. these stories have nothing to do with the hero s journey.
still in sorry thatswedish greta has influenced or comics over there. its so embarrassing to be honest.
what do you mean  starts to  feel like propoganda its been propoganda for years.
heh
from what I understand  gay people dont read gay superhero comics. they prefer comics like the x-men  which is a comic that actually is more relatable to them.
also can you imagine how easy is to fix pollution or climate changes with their technology  this should never be a thing in comics
thats why I prefer the superboy clone from young justice not pol tical agenda or woke
this is why I am for all comics to be deleted. if comics must become a cesspool then just get rid of all of them.
I never saw anyone  ship  mega man x and zero  and not played the games.overwatch people are weird.
really   they tried to go gay superman     stick to the source material and make your own identity gay superhero instead. in what world with a decades long fanbase would they think this would work besides just pissing off fans  and if that was the goal  costly goal because go woke go broke. the end.
I dont want any character talking about anyone s politics in a character I dont want to hear some idiot s stupid politics when Im reading watching or playing ip that I enjoy
when will the big 2 realise that the fake fans they exclusively pander too will never actually buy a comic  the same posers who re-tweeted this virtue signalling garbage instantly started looking for the next thing to pretend they support 2 seconds after pressing the  like  button.
kek
I wonder if the new ceo called this but either way very happy and this is good and should prove dc needs to stop pandering to thr dumb sjws lgbtq groups who dont give a damn about superman or comics just woke crap....if they did the sales would have been better. hopefully they retcon this lame woke superman all together eventually.
so gay people aren t supporting comics   movies made for them   interesting
everything woke turns to shit
superhero comics are already a niche thing why would you try to expand your fanbase to a comunity that is mainly about sexual stuff....
this is what you get for doing this  where you take a character and make him into your own image  you will fail! good riddance!
sometimes you make sense  and other times ... not so much
I wonder if someone can explain why its funny to be concerned about climate change
this character was so one dimensional. just non stop rainbow flags and kissing boys. we get it. he s gay. is that all there is to him  there was nothing there to make you interested in reading about his adventures.
good old fashioned young submissive woman you love to see
making jonathan kent gay is why I stopped collecting dc comics. if dc wants alphabet squad characters then make an original character. making existing characters woke is poor writing and disgusting.
thatsounds awful.
ok now add dc universe on the woke bandwagon. I ain t gonna watch it!!!
garbage in  garbage out.
no doubt it got cancelled  the comic wasnt that great either.
wtf!!!!gay   !!!
what you dont want to watch superman go around protesting climate change
good! no one wants that crap
the only people that will watch gay men kissing etc are gay men....no-one else interested....thats a fact....but hollywood etc call us homophobic......is u shove stuff people dont want to watch in their faces all time then you actually create hate.....the only way forward is make movies shows for gay community and feminists...and let rest of us watch what we want...l know which ones will be more successful.  asa straight guy l turn off shows movies about gay people as l dont relate and dont like it....because lm not gay.....its like liking tea and not coffee but beI g forced to drink coffee or else lm coffee phobic....its a joke tbh. we not allowed to watch what we want.
oh no  this is awful
what  pandering a comic book to a demographic that doesnt buy comic books didnt work I am shocked.
lol!a product that pushes politicsa product that degrades beloved existing charactersa product that irritates and pushes away its existing fanbasea product that the nobody asked fora product that everybody has been asking to be cancelleda product that makes no money!!enough reasons why this failed   hopefully these idiots will start paying attention to the fans and respect to our pop culture and modern myths.
I am a genz kid but at same time as a kid I was raised with morals and this woke crap keep your politics out of entertainment and I wont put mine in your stuff
seriously what is wrong with these ppl ...what s next batman and nightwing  going woke too.alferd is secretly nonbinary hell superman is super fluid...this is nonsense... stop destroying my fav superhero characters with this. they already changed tim drake  robin and batwoman ...glad they cancelled this useless shit.
heroes against villains. I do not read comic books for politics  sexuality or any other thing. if you want to   explore  some weird crap  make a new character!! stop messing with old favorites.
gay super man is cancelled and nothing of value was lost
why is superboy complaining about climate change  just ask his dad  the literal living God to fix thatshit easy
because its a gross departure from any sort of quality comic writing.  thats why its cancelled.  dc should actively fire anyone who supported that comic.
oh no they  re cancelling gay superman  anyway. you can easily put politics into comics. heck look through out history and pick any political issue. done right and brought into the modern world I think you could have a great comic. like doctor who and star trek have done  well old who and trek not todays versions. not preaching and letting you decide. thats how its done entertainment first with politics serving the plot. these days its a shitshow of far left bull infecting everything. money was the king now its tweets. this revamp gay superman will flop just the same. dc an marvel are losing money fast and until they change back they might not be here tomorrow. where as eric july will be.
are katie stole lI l  sis
I do agree with you that these angles in comics are dumb and counter productive. but...do you actually know what the word  woke  means  you parrot it a lot but I dont think you know what it means
both the bros movie and comic book are flops
is just having a gay person or poc character considered  woke  now  climate change storylines  sure  I can see how thats cringy  but what s inherently woke about superman being gay
its never felt better to be homophobic lmao
nope  never said it was
@melonie mac go boom      thats the impression you give when you label every gay character  identity politics  and  pandering to twitter   without explaining how youreached that conclusion.  at this point it feels like anti-woke people come down on every character thats not white and heterosexual. its definitely gone too far.
your down
first
I rank shippers up there with furries and fan fic writers as the cringiest people on the planet
I am not a 90 s kid. I still buy scooby doo movies  but I prefer ones with a decent story. I cant stand this woke retconning nonsense. I have happily downvoted this series already  and have spread the word as best I can.
the terrible  fey art style.
sick of I know let s change all the major fan favourites character s  to gay  black  white  female  trans whatever it is just to please everyone fuck off stop!! its fantasy at the end of the day not everything has to mirror real life  do you honestly think there s a spiderman or superman in the world no. whole point of comics was to take you away from reality!!
garbage is garbage sjw woke bunk doesnt sell.
this imposter isn t even superman look how tiny that dude is.  who green lights these bullshit projects.  do they really think people want to buy this garbage.  I have a brother who is gay and he hates this kind of crap.  going modern day political superman didn t work for superman 4 years ago back in 1986 and they think this shit is going to sell like gangbusters now   what planet do these heads of the comics live on
I am almsot 100  certain that fruity people do not like comic books  like leave all the straight stuff alone and you can go create all the fruity stuff that you want  make it as furity and as rainbowish as possibly you cannn. just leave stuff that were created by straight people alone.. like creat your own foundation  oh wait I forgot evil can never create
yeah  it was a garbage comic. poorly written  try hard to impress people who will never read it  and just dumb. and I am left wing.
talk about getting your news from extremely biased sources. this is pretty sad. no wonder you haven t broken 100k subs lol
beat me by 2 seconds
legend
Im still proud of you
