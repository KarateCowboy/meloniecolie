johnny depp gave a face to the pirates of the caribbean franchise  you cant carry it on without him. if they wanna make a female centric movie about pirates  they could always make a movie about anne bonny. cast margot robbie as anne bonny  give a pirate movie a fresh take  cast robbie as an actual real life pirate who isn t just a genderbent jack sparrow. I d be up for that.
Ive met her a few occasions before she was big. the guy she s now married to was friends with some of my closest friends and tbh I didn t even know who she was when Imet her. she s a genuinely good person  funny  kind of goofy  and seemed very grounded.regardless Im relieved as hell that train wreck got stopped before anything happened. an utterly awful idea.
no matter if it was green lit or not a pirates film without johnny depp would be just wrong.
there was already a female pirates of the caribbean and it was called cutthroat island. geena davis was awesome in it.
that tribute to your dad at the end was gold. that kind of appreciation is literally all we dads want
youre freaking awesome! Ive found you at the beginning of october and literally instantly loved your opinions. feel warmness hearing someone else speak what I think of all the time  especially in these modern days. much love to ya
thank you for giving the underworld series some credit. always felt selene was a proper badass
amazing.  someone who can admit thatsomething she likes isn t necessarily  good .  it really is okey to like stuff that isn t good.  a shame more people dont understand that.
the only female lead movie I want to see right now is classic lara croft tr movie. because that would be so good. yes  johnny debb is the best part of pirates of the caribbean.a lot of the female versions of the male characters dont go through the same struggles  or any at times  like we see the male charaters have to go through to earn their spot as a beloved hero. good point about black widow.great video. love seeing ya. take care melonie.
there s no pirates without johnny  period.
realistically  they cantake a lot from history! I remember reading about a female pirate in either china or korea who wreaked havoc on her nation s enemies. better yet  there was a female pirate in history in the caribbean who had struck fear in a lot of people s hearts.  then  if you would like to make a story about a brutal medieval female ruler  look no further than olga of kiev! not only destroy an entire house  tywin lannister style  she also went on to convert to Christianity and even though she was brutal and murderous  declared a saint by the catholic church. there are plenty of historic examples of females kicking ass! another idea  if you just want a black example  amanitore of kush. the problem with the woke is that they are bleeding lazy!
if you wanted a female pirate  you could write a story about a real life irish pirate  jeannie mac  who was a total badass and bonus cinematography point  she used to ply her trade on the west coast of ireland so ready made gorgeous scenery
love hearing your thoughts on this melonie mac. you brought the boom and love it. also glad this pos all female pirates of the caribbean movie was cancelled. awesome news
the timeline is healing boys!
the way you just started talking about your dad at 15 52 really warmed my heart. it bothers me so much that the elites want to eliminate relationships like that in general  let alone their nefarious reasons
I d love to see a movie on zheng yI sao.  she was so successful as a pirate and the commander of a pirate navy thatshe dictated the terms of her surrender to the government and was pardoned and lived the rest of her life in relative peace.
there was an original pirate movie with a female lead back in 1995  geena davis in renny harlin s cutthroat island. itseriously bombed at the box office  but Ive always thought it was a lot of fun.p.s. a nice antidote for these emasculated modern movies is to watch a john wick movie! and funny thing. each of the three includes in a key role a kickass female fighter. two of them get to fight john himself!
I found your channel 2 weeks ago and Im loving the content!youre based  keep it up!
I love how hopelessly obsessed this woman is with lara croft its adorable.
they already made a  female pirates  movie.  it was in 2005  the xxx parody  and it made money.   if they wanna do a  movie like that with margot robbie  I think some might watch lmao
or grace o malley the irish pirate queen who battled the english navy on behalf of ireland  even queen elizabeth I greatly respected her.
or miss fortune.
they already did a female pirates movie in 2005. it was called pirates xxx and itstarred jesse jane.
cutthroat island
I d be up for that... after they made 10s of thousands of pirate movies about every single male pirate.
me  hollywood!!! write! this! down!hollywood  nah  let s replace indiana jones with a woman.
@mickey mickey  beat me to it
or mary read
I watched for the 1st time all movies in a row. and I can say  for sure  the last two are weak  the series should have ended for a long time. unless they can pull out something really extraordinary  leave it.
@mickey mickey  lmfao Ive seen that
not sure if it was an act or not  but here in australia before the move to the u.s.  she came across as just your average girl next door type of person  with a touch of goofiness as you mentioned  but I dont doubt the power of hollywood to corrupt.
she is great as harley quinn  I would love to see a quality stand alone antI hero movie focused on her character. you cannot replace johnny depp.
sure you do...Im good friends with deniro as well.
I like margot. some of her stuff is mostly female based. yet I still like it. she always does a good job.
@osier  I dont know tbh. I haven t seen her probably in about 10 years but from what my friends have said who have seen her more recently  she hasn t really changed that much.   I d like to think she s stayed the same as before because she really did come across as a good person.
@xgarrettthiefx  Imean nobody s forcing you to believe me.  really not even water off my back either way but feel free to check out her husbands background. Godalming college in the uk.
they where only going to make the movie because they dont think deep was going to survive the court case. and now he s back. goodbye all female pirates of the caribbean.
margot is silly beautiful she was great in  once upon a time in hollywood  and  the wolf of wall street
but that would mean hiring competent writers  showrunners  actresses etc. and even then it would be a gamble  as that movie wouldn t have the built-in audience that a potc movie brings with it. they just want to reap the benefits of the potc franchise and do 1 or 2 quick cash-grabs and then walk away  leaving it lying in ruins.
@theobserver85   pretty much
the entire 2nd act of the 3rd movie is a keira knightley led pirate movie in the same universe.
irish lass operating in the caribbean sea sounds cool.
@joven c  me too
disney does nt make new characters  they just recycle and reduce characters into nothingness.
the last pirates movie was terrible   I only liked the first two  the others 3 was meh and 4 was bloody awful. its best to leave these movies be depp had a good run
did a watch through of all the movies. first was good  second was find  everything after was just dumb. the ahvjd thing also leaves a bad taste in the mouth.
agreed
there already was a female pirates movie. itstarred jesse jane.
disney has cut ties to him
there was also one called pirates xxx and itstarred jesse jane.
thank you!! I have been trying to remember the name of geena davis  movie.
they can make new ones.
reported for logic and reason.  Imean  Im gonna second that   a light in the wokie darkness. for sure.
damn right she was.
people always wanted her and blade to crossover  it would ve been so interesting for so many reasons  especially given selene is a vampire
kate beckinsale is outstanding in this series. an underrated franchise to be sure
and  this is key  original
@kazer  very
you have a really good dad melonie. we need good Godly men like your dad. may God continue to bless him.
I really dont want to see johnny depp play lara croft.
also anne bonny and mary reid real life female pirates .
@hamanu666  that is who I was talking about.  anne bonny.
ching shih female pirate from china. the  terror of south china  is already a character in pirates of the caribbean.
@stant123  truth be told  I am at work and dont really have time to do all of the research on their names. I just know the major points behind the history.
so true  lazy and no writing talent. olga was brutal but she had reason after what they did to her beloved husband  that is why they would never do a movie about her because her whole motivation was her husband and she was a devoted Christian later in life  two things hollywood hates made her who she was.
did you know that female pirates of any century were vanishingly rare  there s good reasons for this  btw. female pirates do not exist today  either.
didn t you know  most pirates historically were female. and those that weren t were trans.fad history is so fun...
@hiraghm  wtf ! are you insane  pirates in any century weren t female  indeed women were vanishingly rare. even today  this is still the truth  women aren t pirates.
@scott doesntmatter  he joking  but also female pirates weren t nonexistent. zheng yI sao had dozens of ships
@an overly sarcastic  sleepy fox  female pirates did exist  they were just incredibly rare. they still are.
also  I remember in dublin primary school it was a particularly useful substitute if you wanted to swear  Jesus Christ!
and as far as women replacing men  the peggy situation was more of a one-shot cameo  so Im not as annoyed about that.  and while t challa should have been recast  I cant blame shurI for that.
a pirate empress in command of useless junks that are nothing but target practice.
a guy thinks cutthroat island was a lot of fun  then complains about emasculated movies... I give up.
simple  its about adding more chairs to the table  not replacing those already seated.
the movie actually had a good plot.
keep preaching  melonie! love your stuff  seems like its rarer and rarer to find minds with your perspective  which should be pretty normal.
it doesnt even make sense  elizabeth swann proved herself to be a brave and capable pirate in her own right. they just wanted to replace jack sparrow.
f in chat for jacqueline sparrow
I think if this had gone through it would probably be heavily compared to the porn pirates movie that came out in the early 2000s. also there s cutthroat island with geena davis as the lead and a pirate  the movie didn t do good at the box office but I always enjoyed itso I think a female pirate movie could work just not in this current era of movie making. in the comics the female superheroes were not meant to be replacements not the case with recent years and characters like lady thor and rirI  they were companions  partners  and friends of the male heroes just someone else to join in on the fight  but in the mcu they are differently replacing male characters with females or dumbing down the men and showing the women as superior  the character black panther didn t have to die because the actor portraying him did  but disney saw it as an opportunity to replace a male character and they took it  yes it happened in comics  but that was short lived and most likely that version of the character was more developed than the live action version which never had that much screen time and was really just a side character who was thrust into the main role.
new video! yes! Im here for it. great to see ya melonie.
kudos to your dad. your vid takes are always great. keep up those opinions we need to hear.
johnny depp never  needed  disney  but the pirates of the carribean definitely needs johnny depp. forever and always will he be captain jack sparrow!
Im glad you keep your Christianity up front. your reviews are great and right in line with my thoughts on things
we look like we re like laughing and having fun  but we re dying on the inside. dying. I was like  this is the most humiliating moment of my life.  margo robbie on a barbie movie leaked photos. so thats 2 movies she s disappointed in. at least she s getting paid for one.
you know that they could do a historical adaptation of the life of anne bonnie an actual pirate  stories of her  calicoe jack and mary reed are really interesting.
your videos  and thatsmile  make my day melonie
thank you for your first 35 seconds sentences  I was beginning to think I was crazy or fascist or ...ist for thinking exactly the same  and expressing that online  hearing that from a woman is mental peace. finally. Im not against women or characters of all races  just against rewriting well-known and established characters  gender swapping or race swapping. its especially annoying in tolkien s work  which comes from traditionally white mythology. I say its like taking a centenary traditional chinese book  like  dreams in the red chamber   and making half of the cast white  the other half black  and just a few chinese people here and there  for diversity s sake. obviously  all the characters in the book are chinese  and thats how itshould be. some people can understand this simple fact. and btw  why isn t wakanda  diverse
I forget aliens sometimes for some reason and one more strong female character was the mc in the new predator movie
let s be serious. the actual issue is that if disney did make a sexy lady-pirate movie then it wouldn t be rated arrrrrr!
a friend of mine who works in the film industry says that the familiarity of brand raises the box sales by a predictable percentage  but I think that the consumer motivations have changed- they might want to start thinking differently. if not to continue the industry with a new approach  then to restart it- because right now its in cardiac arrest.
one of the rare occasions where I agree with a video 100 . good work.
there was a female led pirates movie  and it did pretty well for its market. it even got a sequel.
gina davis in the pirates of cutthroat island is still one of my favorite movies.
not sure if you are into broadway shows or anything  but there is a really good musical called  aida   which features an extremely strong female character- the title character  a nubian princess who falls in love with an egyptian naval captain. I think its a massive crime that disney hasn t adapted the musical to film  it was originally conceived as a movie  but they made it a broadway musical instead  yet.
I would be down to see more female lead movies if it had a good story  I feel a good story could be potencially have a female character go through a whole charcater arc about questioning her morals whether being a pirate is a good or bad thing  see her struggle to become a compitent and trustworthy pirate to eventually become a feared pirate. maybe even have her change her ideals at one point where she starts off as a very basic feminin character who has to go through hell on sea hardening her body and mind making her realise how ugly the world is yet seeing the beauty of it at the same time. Imean hell you can make where she even becomes the villain to some degree in the story. there s a lot they could do but disney being disney will just choose the easy way and make her super  smart  perfect  good at everything  and be superior to every guy she encounters.

get back to work  mr.squidward. xd
yeah  I saw those
I think I remember hearing about thatstory awhile back  and maybe 15 years ago disney woulda gave it a shot. but after frozen  they dont give a crap about female   male romance stories in their pricness garbage collection. its all about feminist overpowered bitches and remakes of popular media. someone did the math awhile ago  and the princess films used to mathematically increase attendance over a year by around a billion dollars for their crowning cermonies and stuff. they made 2 billion off of that garbage lion king remake on ticket sales alone.... yeah iono if they can even think of making new good stuff anymore
I love aida. I think that they didn t do much with it because its geared for an audience thats a bit older because of some of the themes in it. hopefully it will become a movie  but I kind of doubt it.
@visser matt  what I heard was that aida was pitched as an animated musical film to elton john and tim rice in 1995  but elton declined because he had just done lion king a short while ago. so the pitch was taken up by disney theatricals after a few years and they decided to make it a broadway musical. there are a lot of similarities in the music style and composition of the songs in aida and lion king- borrowing ideas from various musical styles from around the world  especially reggae and african folk music  infused with elton s pop sensibilities. aida was also supposed to be released as a live action film in 2007  starring Christian aguilera and beyonc   but the film never went into production. I am also not a big fan of the lion king remake  I actually wrote two alternate versions of the remake- one is a film adaptation of the broadway show  the other a version of the story set in india with asiatic lions and other indian animals playing the main roles   and I hate several of the changes made to the remake. I am also not a fan of how the remakes are made in general. I am really disappointed with disney these days. I dont think it will be soon before disney experiences a massive downfall in pop culture.
@aeric abison  while I kind of agree about the sustainability of this crap not being good for the company. I also know disnoids exist. there are young people who think disney walks on water  no matter how garbage a product it is. a lot of parents still remember disney when they were kids and think its thatsame child magic. people can wake up  but I dont have any faith in them they will. disney will eventually balance out imo  where they continue to make this insane garbage for at least another decade. they will be less profitable for awhile. either the general public gets used to the new age garbage and the disney owns and controls the market again  or something else replaces it. disney is full of people at its core who really believe in producing crap over finding and writing new good stuff. bob iger set up the company to be a rolling ice ball. getting bigger and bigger as it grabs more and more auxiliary properties  but that ice ball has an empty melted core at its heart nowadays.
I would be down to see a female led movie if I could walk out of the theater  go into the theater next door  and watch a movie with no females in it  no poc in it  no alternate sexualities in it. I d pay double to see that female led movie  just to watch the other movie  after.that is how sick I am of the agenda. I think Imight have to go back to  robinson crusoe on mars  to see such a movie... and Im not sure about it
wait... were there any females in  master and commander   that d work.
someone was saying the other day in discord that this movie was canned cause people were uploading clips and screenshots of the adult parody films called pirates and disney locked their twitter account then someone made a new account and paid for the verification and they did it there too with comments like  but we already have a all female pirates movie if it was true  it would have been the biggest meme on this.
the look on your face in the thumbnail is classic. will any of these companies ever come to grips about how people dont want woke bs
black sails was really amazing show and they had strong female leads they did try and push a little  wokeness  but generally amazing show
personally cut throat island could always be added onto it had some strong female leads and it was a good pirate flick
for some reason writers things it is the writing itself that makes the character but in actuality its the actor. that what makes certain actor greater than others. jonny depps character became his because he made his own version of jack sparrow despite what that writings said. but for some reason writers and creators today believes anyone can farm a character and any gender. if that was the case than hiring actors in the first place woudnt be needed.
look  the handsome men were a huge bonus to pirates of the caribbean. also  no matter what without johnny depp  there is no pirates movie. he made it what it was.
even though he said he s never work with disney again  and who could blame him  disney needs to do their best to get johnny depp back for one more movie.  they need to deliver on the way that they ended the last one.  bring jack  will    elizabeth back together one last time and finish the story off like itshould be done.  maybe find a way to bring back barbosa.  the new characters would be good fits to move forward after they end the main storyline  and you could still have the main characters in later movies making appearances  much like stallone has been able to do with rocky.
I really like your takes  we have overlapping interests  but your perspective is very different from mine and always makes me think about things differently as a result. thanks  going boom!
writing a pirate story shouldn t be too hard . you could even have them portray or base the character off real female pirates that actually existed with interesting and cool stories.
they need the pirates of the caribbean name to sell the merch and the theme park rides.
they could ve made a female pirate movie based on the irish pirate queen grace o malley and you can call it  queen of the seas
I would love to see margot robbie as the  main villain vs johnny depp jack sparrow!
the uniform peggy carter is wearing belonged to union jack in the comics.
its an odd choice to use margot robbie. if anything itshould star keira knightley as she already has ties to the series  and it might  make for an interesting spun off movie. like what happens in between the visits of flying dutchman  and add ms. robbie to the cast.that is the way the should have approached it.
said once say it before. .after I drop this album Im pulling up proper on melanie rofl  on God..girl is smart  an independent  thinker  and adorable to top it off
there is a female pirate character in disneyland called red.  maybe if disney created  a story around her instead using the pirates of the caribbean franchise
remember the leaked zoom calls with that one disney director about a year ago about a not so secret agenda of some kind  with disney owning all the major ip s that kids like  and disney being owned by blackrock  the goal is pretty obvious with what they re doing
that first part of your first sentence came out very musically to my ears  thought you were about to sing!
there are a couple of famous women pirates  they just have to type famous female pirates and they would get a lot of info and they could make a movie without being cringe
no  no  no.  robbie misunderstood.  they just meant the title of the next movie is  pirates of the caribbean  dead in the water
if you want to see how to make an action movie with a woman integrated into a franchise where she doesnt insult the main action hero but comes off as super cool partner and likeable character  then watch  supercop  1992 with jackie chan and michelle yeoh.  watch it in chinese with subtitles  not english dubbed because that would be silly.  you can see how they dont make the female just do the same thing as the male but better.  she does things differently.  that is the reality of the male  female dynamic.
in our real history there have been female pirates and bonnie and mary reed. to name a few. why not just say this is a pirates of the caribbean story and base it on these characters. assassin s creed does that by putting real pirates in assassin s creed 4
finally some good news
to do an all female pirates of the caribbean would have to be athletic  and with theatrical elements  because the problem is the audience buying into it.  the best one I have seen with a female lead is geena davis  cutthroat island  1995 .  one thing about geena davis  she was athletic and practiced archery as a sport  as one of the best female archers in america.  this fitness helped carry the physical aspects of the role.  in addition  the movie cannot be woke  where the woman gets the man  and this will be likeable for a muscle  pirate  mommy role.  moreover  no obvious nudity  we dont need it  we need an actual story.
a female led pirate movie already existed back in the 80s its called cutthroat island something like that
they could make an original movie about the true life female pirates  who were actually some of the most dangerous and bloodthirsty women in history. anne bonny or mary read would make terrific characters in their own movie  or even grace o malley or give it an asian flair featuring cheng I sao. bonney and read were said to have been more dangerous and seasoned fighters than the men in calico jack s crew. is itso hard to tell their stories
everytime lara croft s bastardized woke treatment can be brought up to rightfully add to the argument  I imagine melonie is like  oh  for me  you shouldn t have
if disney wants to do a female version of pirates of the caribbean so badly they do not need to reboot the pirates of the caribbean franchise to do it there is a famous real life female pirate and american world history her name was and bonnie who fought during the war of succession in the caribbean
if they want to change the lead character they need an episode with jack and the new lead. passing the baton.
I d like to see lara croft half brother video game.
glen close as jacks mom in  I lost my nugget
2 samuel 7 14-15   I will be a father to him  and he ll be a son to me. when he does wrong  I ll discipline him in the usual ways  the pitfalls and obstacles of this mortal life. but I ll never remove my gracious love from him. - true masculinity
this was supposed to be a original story. that what I heard but  we haven t had news for year  I figured it was a dead project.
very happy 4 u having a wonderful father as u described. and thank you 4 ur effort here  keep it up. it very inspiring and logically intelligent.
if you cannot write a good story then all you can do is still someone else s. and from the stories I have seen from hollywood the past few years it is obviously they cant write.
Imean it already started off with a fairly strong female co star role with knightly
they re trying to get johnny back lmao
they had elizabeth swan and other female characters in the other movies but itd b hard bc jack sparrow jd is the face of potc
best news today. just bring back the exonerated johnny depp for more pirates. was always his vehicle and its what the fans most want
if they want a girl pirate movie  write a script about anne bonny  mary reade and jack rackham...real pirates...could be awesome....
their  was one already  called  black sail
Ive been following you on twitter for a few months now but I was unaware you had a youtube channel. I cant quite figure why but I thought there would be more butter.
looks like its already been done. dont think they can do any better than this pirates  also known as pirates xxx  is a 2005 american  nude-ographic  action-adventure film written  produced  and directed by joone  and produced by digital playground and adam   eve. the film  starring jesse jane  carmen luvana  janine lindemulder  devon  jenaveve jolie  teagan presley  and evan stone  features many references to the mainstream hollywood film pirates of the caribbean  the curse of the black pearl.
cutthroat island was a pirate film  itstarred gina davis. you may not have heard about it though...
birds of prey was good. campy and fun.
there s already a female led pirates of the caribbean movie.. if you know  you know..
if they bring back depp  there s still a good case for robbie to play some kind of role. the pirates movies suffered once the extra storyline and charisma that bloom   knightley provided was gone.
honestly  Im glad. last thing it needs is a reboot. a sequel  sure. but a reboot !
I hope this is true. depp as jack  or no pirates film.
I love the underworld franchise
I really like your videos. keep on rocking
I dont know what s worse the fact that they re changing all the iconic characters sex race or that they cant come up with anything original! ! !
the last two pirates movies were nothing but an excuse for people to watch more jack sparrow. pardon  captain jack sparrow.
they made a female lead pirates movie years ago it was lead by jesse jane
black sails wasted their opportunity to write anne bonny into an interesting  filled-out character. or perhaps it was clara paget glowering and spitting out her two dozen lines like broken glass for 35 episodes.  rich irony indeed that the pub owner on the waterfront  hannah new s character  was far better written than the historical person with a huge backstory.
there was a pirate film starring geena davis. cutthroat island. so they aren t the first to do it and for them to get all sanctimonius about
sounds like starting to learn proud of them.
I honestly would ve loved to have seen a pirates movie with margot. I think it could ve been really fun
we re on our way to becoming  the grey  like in the film ai.
thanks melonie! you are right! I think we should start calling those feminists toxic feminists at this point. toxic femininity is a thing imo.
femestupid pirate movie runs a ground on razor sharp rocks of reality. was there any other outcome
is it wrong that I liked the movie because of the plot believe it or not.
@john durham  no  because it was an amazing film for that industry. but  who was your favorite actress  I like the belly dancers.. one was abbey brooks.
@john durham  well extreme is unsafe for youtube. our comments are already shadow banned under my op.
@david t  not suprising  but I do apologize to mel

I actually liked her performance even though bonny would ve probably been more educated since she came from wealthy family. as for the rest of the series hit or miss.
and it flopped historically  despite geena was even more popular back then than margot is today
@doctraubo  exactly.
appreciate your support towards my channel 
there are several female pirates in history that a movie could be based.
Ive said it once and I ll keep saying it  there s no such thing as  toxic masculinity   there s masculinity and there are assholes and that applies to both sexes.
oh no. gee  I am so sad. whatever will we do
just make an entirely separate pirate style story with a female lead  dont make it a spin off of an already made franchise. and make sure its story written  not politically ideologically inclusivity diversity wokie written. all those things can play parts of the story but not the focal reason for it.
I would have loved to see pirate captain margot robbie if the movie had a different name
if they are going to reboot something do  cutthroat island  but going to be hard to beat!
the only pirates of the caribbean movie I want is one that gives will and elizabeth a happy ending.
margot robbie as a pirate  sign me up. not seeing a problem here
hImelonie thoughts on games like kingdoms of alamaur and fable 1-3
huh I never heard they were doing a female pirates of the caribbean movie  wouldn t surprise me if they were though
I haven t been interested in pitates since the second or third film. if I were to ever watch one again  it would be for cap n jack sparrow. period. I love margot robbie  but Im much more excited to gawk at her in the barbie movie  another reprisal as harley  or as melonie mentions  a new story with a new female hero thatshe portrays.as for the female led ghostbusters movie  it wasn t bad. I think that the real problem that that movie had is that fans wanted to see the original team back together one last time  but it was too late for that. the movie could have been a million times better than it was  and hardcore gb fans still wouldn t care without the og cast.
pirates is nothing without jack and depp.this is not black panther that chadwick rip played a character. jack is depp  he created that persona on his own.if its a spinoff... sure but we know why.
oh no! the tragedy!...well  back to life in the real world.
nobody wanted poc without johnny depp jack sparrow as the main star
Im happy  cause I was finally able to play bloodborne  thanks to a friend that borrowed me his ps4  still want a pc port though
there s always assassinette s creed  orange flag.  wokify both a video game and movie all in one swell foop.
underworld movie has an incredible female protagonist!  selene is bad ass.
johnny depp or nothing...
the sad truth is that there actually were  if sources are to be believed  a few female real pirates corsairs. so there is actual real material to base on if writers are really so creatively bankrupt. which btw I wouldnt mind seeing made a long as it d be not woke bs.
I wonder.  bring jd back for jack sparrow!
gina davis is a gem in that one and the long kiss goodnight
the gender studies people grew up and started working  hence why now we get more and more of thatstuff. if when they become in charge of companies and get leadership roles  we ll be stuck with it until the end.
if people want to make a pirate movie  why hijack potc  make one about gr inne mhaol  queen of pirates. it doesnt have to be completely historically accurate  heck almost all pirate media is about as accurate as cowboy media anyway. just take bits of her story  cast a crew passionate about the role  not the message  the role   and have fun with it.
well said melonie
my understanding is thatsam wilson will be the mcus captain america  but peggy carter s captain britain was included because it was a multiverse movie. same with monica s mom being captain marvel instead of carol. jane foster did become thor in the movie  only to be killed off at the end. she-hulk was just done a disservice. basically  a chunk of these aren t new ideas they re just presented that way. very  very badly.
and for example the bayoneta game  in wich they replaced bayoneta for her androgenic daughter who came out of nowhere because bayoneta was a very sexy femenine caracter so she must been erase of her own story
been following silent for a good while. all eyes since g4. opinions are noted
no one could live up to what jack sparrow did... not even jack sparrow.
you cant replace johnny depp. no freaking way!  nojohnnynopirates
I kinda liked the decent. all female adventurers that collapse and push past a bunch of gollums.you could think of it as matriarch vs patriarch yet one gollum was female and some females turned on each other.
replacing a man in a male dominated genre always fails.
Ive been told that women on a ship are bad luck.  I could see how this could create some interesting scenarios if a crew of all women wanted to pretend to be pirates  though.  once in a lifetime storms  whale and shark attacks  mysterious ailment takes out your navigator stranding you in the middle of the ocean...  and then  captain jack sparrow shows up to rescue them from their mistakes in life.  I d watch that.
I find it funny that movie execs think women like me are more interested in seeing representation rather than competent  attractive  and interesting men. they are grossly underestimating their female heterosexual audience.
they remove and humiliate every strong male character and then wonder why millions of young men idolise prominent men in the manosphere space like andrew tate  myron gains  justin weller  tristan tate. like wtf did they expect
tbh I dont understand why they wouldn t just make an animated show and cast whoever they want as jack sparrow.
I really liked the way new lara croft looked. based I know.
Im glad because I really like margot robbie  and the media would ve done their absolute best to try and bait her into some culture war bs about feminism or something.
cut throat island is what they are going for. which was a fun movie with genna davis. why not do something like that  it was original for its time. instead of high jacking a franchise  and making it for   today s audience.  some reboots worked  because of good writing. when they sex swapped star buck  in the reboot of battle star galactica it worked  because cara thrace was written very well. not to mention kattee  sackof did a good job acting the role. samantha carter  sam is another case where we see a strong woman who was written well in a franchise  and who is a strong woman.  which amanda tapping did a great job portraying. and thanks for the bit at the end about your dad. that is my dad. he is a strong man  who made me and my sisters feel safe growing up  and is still someone who I can go to  if I need advise and help. cheers mac!!! hope you have a great day!!
margot doesnt understand that trying to replace jack sparrow   are way too big shoes to fill
I disagree with most. I would love to see a side pirate movie. wither it was female or not. as long as it wasn t woke and stayed with world build they have already done and wove the old into it. maybe guest scenes with characters from the other movies. Imean solo and mandalorian is well loved by fans but neither has luke  han or leia as main. side stories is not a bad thing if they are well done and is presented as a side project separate from the main.
harry styles to play vasquez in the aliens remake
probably a good thing. they should get depp back  there really is no pirates movie without jack sparrow  let s be honest
making an entirely new story with female characters requires something severely lacking now days  talented  intelligent writers.
great video beautiful melonie!! I am happy that they cancelled the female pirates of the caribbean movie!!
why dont they make a movie with black kat a video game from xbox and playstarion 2  that I would love to see
pirates of the caribboobean  dead woman s chest  the sea-faring hijinks of jaqueline sparrow. sorry... but it just doesnt have the same kind of oomph.
5 55 well we all know why they want to attach it to the pirates of the carribean franchise  because any movie attacjed to the franchise will draw in more customers than a new ip would.thatsaid - there s also a practical reason that might be worth considering  the franchise has a lot of supernatural elements that follow some vague supernatural rules. a new franchise would have to establish new rules for these supernatural elements.if they wanted to make a movie with no supernatural elements but an old-fashioned swashbuckling movie then yeah  attaching it to the pirates of the carribean doesnt make sense.
the concept could work if they had violence and nudity on a game of thrones level. but being done by disney it was always bound to be a failure
they should just resume pirates 6 wit johnny depp. the return of davey jones
dang  I was hoping they d make it. its fun to watch woke business waste money.
at this point  companies are just milking old classics using the woke trend to make a quick buck. when will they learn that itsimply doesnt work.
sooo9  maureen o hara and gena davis already did this  and guarantee its better than this tripe would have been.
when you dump the guy who carried the franchise on his back for 5 movies  the fans of the guy and the franchise aren t gonna take that well. let that be a lesson  disney
why not make something about mary read   anne bonny
this has absolutely nothing to do with anything  but good Lord melonie is attractive.
yeah! there are historical pirates who are women. have movies based on these real world pirate  womem.
I personally dont mind powerful women roles  but what I hate is when its forced. when the woman is so much more powerful than any man  then its being forced. when these movies   shows  comics  videogames  etc  have to raise women up by tearing men down  always portraying all men as evil or inept or cowardly or all  then its being forced. ripley in alien is a good example of a realistic   powerful woman role  same for sarah connor in terminator  and I could go on   on. rey in star wars is forced. she hulk show is forced.
I think it would have been good if margot robbie was leading it.
this girl robbie needs to understand it is not about her
I do have to disagree with the idea that all players are trying to be masculine. there are alot of guy who have been destroyed by the loves of their lives. Imyself am currently trying to pick up the pieces of my heart from my fiance breaking up with me and keeping her son  who sees me more as his father than his own biological  and have been for half a year. the sheer level of pain I wake up with every morning is fucking unbearable sometimes and I keep plugging through the days. I will never be able to fully give myself to another woman because how can I  I am not condoning the actions of some of these dirtbags but dont just dismiss some of these dudes because they aren t being man whores because its  masculine  but because they never can let themselves get caught again like that.
when people stop watching garbage. the merchandising skit from spaceballs predicted the modern not entertainment industry to a t.
I wouldn t watch this if it came out. hell even if they made a new one with johnny  I d question it after all the trash disney has been putting out. probably still wouldn t watch it.
male self-identity tends to be built around  provide  protect  or procreate .when building a male identity around employment was condemned  the alternatives were crass money or sex. without the sense of masculine identity around protection was rejected  of course men aren t going to respond in pro-social ways.if there is no prestige for attention to detail or competence  people are going to avoid offering that as an example to follow which makes it harder for others to find the best ways.
they can make a pirate film with female lead and call it a rear breed.
dc was planning to replace superman and batman with female counterparts and almost did it  only backing down because the idea was extremely unpopular.now I find out disney wanted to make a pirates of the caribbean film with a female protagonist. geez. Im shocked by the audacity and ideological fanaticism of our entertainment industry.
fun fact  historically there were female pirates. in fact there were two famous ones that disguised themselves as men
fun fact there was actually queen of pirates who story I one the most badass in of all the pirate stories rivaling the goats of the time and would ve made for a awesome trilogy as the story is quiet long as unlike most she didn t go down without a fight hell it even has diversity as the people she robbed were mostly chinese people and most of get crew we re asain   maybe her I cant remember   as well but no let s instead make a  genderbent jack sparrow ripoff read your history because last I checked its what made your company do gangbusters at theaters for decades
I remember a time when women wanted to do their own things. things that men couldn t  or wouldn t do. I remember a time when a woman wasn t a girl in a break-away man suit trying to be a man. I remember a time when women loved being women.
but there were females in pirates of the carribean...oh shitcancels project
there are so many examples of real actual female pirates why not make one of them a story
they could of made a female led spinoff in the same world  then have them connect to johnny s depp movies down the line. but they where just gonna replace johnny with her as jack sparrow  wouldn t work
things change  - batman to the joker in batman  1989 also  confusion on  hollywood is gender swapping mcu   they all exist in the source material.  if anything  you should be criticizing the comics that did this.
technically  the mcu isn t completely female based. they literally killed peggie and jane foster in the main films. the comics replaced thor with jane foster  he literaly gave her his hammer and his name because he believed that he was unworthy. then a monster literally cut off his arm. . but the movie  however  had thor stay true to himself. and they just killed jane instead of her replacing him. so the mcu actually got anti-woke for once  giving the middle finger to the dumbass storyline from the woke comics.
cutthroat island has entered the chat.
I d actually be okay with margot being a lead in a pirates movie  but not like this.
laughs in jena davis
captain jack sparrow is johnny depp s role. without johnny depp there is no pirates of the caribbean.  the reason why they needed the pirates of the caribbean name attached to the margot robbie project is very simple. china bucks. the chinese loved the pirates of the caribbean movies. thats why they needed the name.
I feel like a ton of people forget the lost gem cutthroat island with gena davis. that was a good pirate movie with a strong female lead.
there was already a female lead pirate movie..
instead of leeching off a  let s face it  depleated franchise  why not make a franchise based on female pirates and pirate queens that actually existed in history   there are some truely awe-inspiring and badass women that rocked the pirate world! zheng yI sao  also known as ching shih being my personal favorite pirate of all time  look her up you wont be dissapointed .
cutthroat island  geena davis .  remake that if you want
for me that movie is hard to watch.
its rather cringe tho
there was a reason it was forgotten it bombed badly.
personally I think she makes the worst quinn  she is actually one of the reasons why the character these days is as schizo as she is. though indeed gifted to my opinions she s more an activist then actor.
my wife tells me that when she watches these movies  she wants to see men.she enjoys watching men do manly things.she thinks that these movies are being made for lesbians.if true  that is a chasing a very small demographic. I certainly dont have a problem with lesbians having made that films cater to their interests  but the studios should expect to fill a lot of seats with these movies.
its not that disney didn t want to because we all know they did its that disney cant do it because they dont have the money
if this thing was to be reboot  then I am against it and glad it is canceled. however  I would have no problem with a female-led pirate movie with the  pirates of the caribbean  name. the whole franchise was made as a reference to a disneyland ride  it isn t like hans Christian andersen wrote a fairy tale about jack sparrow. it is pirates of the caribbean - plural. why couldn t they make a new female pirate character and have her be doing her own stuff in the west indies while jack sparrow is doing his thing  as long as it is good story  it would be cool to follow the adventures of a different pirate  and jack sparrow  or any other character  could make a cameo. what would be really cool would be to re-shoot an iconic scene with the original actors from a different angle  then have their new character watch it through a spyglass  and be like   nope. turn the ship around!  it isn t exactly the mcu because it would be an original disney ip rather than characters previously made by marvel  but there is no reason why there cannot be multiple protagonist-level characters in the same universe. one need not try to bring them all together an one epic film the way  the avengers  movie did  they would only need cameos or references to the other movies to place the story in the  pirates  universe and give some clue about the timeline.another possibility would be to use the conan ip  get jason mamoa back  because arnold is too old   and dramatize the conan story  queen of the black coast.  the story would therefore have two leads. kill her off at the end of the movie - just as in the short story  then  if the film is successful  make spin-off movies or tv shows about what she was doing before she met conan. hell  it would even not be a problem if they made her black  she is  ivory-white  in the story  because her entire crew was black.
and they say there is no good news..
the pirates franchise should just stay in the early 2000 s. depp should just ignore disney and let the franchise lie.
depp absolutely carried thatseries and it was limping along to begin with  so played out. its just so ridiculous  as usual you wonder what planet these people are on
female focused film
disney producers    we re the ones in charge.  we dont need johnny depp to make millions.    I thought these guys were supposed to be woke! and Im a liberal  dude.
catalog along with the original  good  versions they already made years ago   sigh....... I legit just thought of this while typing and
I say remake charlie s angels where charley is a chick and the angels are guys.
if you want a female led pirate movie  cutthroat island has already been made. Ive never understood why they keep replacing traditionally male roles with females  the end result is always a crash and burn.
margot robbie aussie represent!
reminds me of how  when the casting for  the witcher  was announced some years back and how black fans were as annoyed as anybody else was about how it was being handled and announced. I recall black fans being quoted as saying things to the effect of  why cant we get an original black character given to us instead of having to beg for a bone in the form of an established character being changed to black   I couldn t agree more. hollyweird is taking the cheap   easy way out  instead of going to the effort of writing new characters  they re centering their efforts on  muh representayshun  in an effort to make a quick buck. not to mention the trend of making male superheroes look like dumpy and average dad bod types  hello  namor . how well s that doing for you  hollyweird  Im not even the most traditionally masculine guy and I see right through this nonsense as a  walking gray area  as I like to call myself. Im a guy and I like girls  and I will never apologize for that.
didn t this all start with the all this with the female ghostbusters
hey hollywood !!!!  wanna do a great movie about a female pirate   anne bonny was a real life female pirate and her story has all the things you love  bloodshed  thievery  sex  lesbians  women dressing like men trying to convince other people they actually are men  how shakespearian   all it takes is a couple of books on pirate history and you ll have a script of your very own.  btw  there will be a whole lot of white guys in the script  but there were a lot of black pirates too.  you ll have enough for every ship.
the best era for movies was 98-2005  back when originality was a thing
with expectations you can say thatsuicide squad is better than wonder woman...... just my opinion I watched em back to back
mel is parroting many of the same points as andrew tate ie the destruction of masculine men. one wonders if melonie would ever collaborate with a red pill content creator in the foreseeable future or dip her toe in the space.
long live depp
I d love to see a potc spin-off around penelope cruz s character  maybe even blackbeard too   alongside salma hayek. salma and penelope are gold together.
thing is  an all-female spinoff of potc could be good  but it just wouldn t be  mainly because of all the rules hollywood places on writing female characters. just look at any mostly-female action movie from the last few years.
great video!
no margo  it isn t that they didn t want to make it. we didn t want it. nobody but the handful of activists on social media wanted it.if I want some cool swashbuckling female action I ll go watch geena davis kick arse all over the place in cut throat island again  and again  and again... great movie. it is possible to make awesome female pirate movies without hijacking pre existing male movies and this movie proves it.
best news ever
black widow is problematic for woke man hating hollywood  she is incredibly close to hawkeye  like twin siblings  she has a little sister like relationship with captain america and a sweet romantic relationship with the hulk and a positive father-daughter like relationship in her life  hollywood cannot stand a female character with positive male relationships  that is why she was pushed aside  look at alita whose life is built around two loving relationships with the men in her life  hollywood seems to hate her.
the vikings tv show is amazing show better than game of thrones it has great story  great character archs  and has good strong male and  female characters
masculine men  we re not going any where. Im still masculine and southern. I will always hold the door open for everyone and it will alway be yes sir no sir yes ma am no ma am. but we ve also realised you cant help those who dont want help. I ll be there to help but I wont help until Im asked from now on. some poeple have to learn the hard way lol.
there was a female led pirate movie  and done well. full knowing a female pirate leading a ship would be hard  they built in the how and why.  it was really good  it was led by gena davis. cutthroat island. this was before feminazI s got its claws in it.
is that the anti-uni-brow
the way they fired johnny was wrong and Im not sad to see this movie cancelled  but honestly  I would rather they cancel thatsh tshow of a indiana jones movie with phoebe waller bridge.  raiders of the lost ark has been one of my favorite movies for over 40 years and Im still emotionally attached to it unlike star wars and star trek.  I really dont want to see them destroy it with this last terrible  sequel .
I would love to see a new and original pirate movie with  more female leads but why does it have to be on the back of successful franchises like potc where the lead just happened to male  its not even a franchise that doesnt have strong female characters! elisabeth became the freaking pirate king! you can have both strong male and female characters in one story!its like they want woman to be seen as independent and strong er than men  but they cant be bothered putting in the work to create good content themselves. hollywood has lost it!
hoist the colors for jack!
they already had a woman led pirates of the caribbean movie.  cut throat island  and it was pretty good.  came out back in 1995 when studios actually knew how to make a female led movie instead of the garbage they are putting out that has completely ruined female led movies.  but then again  going by the way things have been  it will only be so long until we have a movie come out with a strong cast of actors who were born biologically male but identify as female.
smart the company doesnt want to lose a tone of money .
I slightly disagree with you.toxic masculinity does exist  just as toxic femininity exists. but the problem these days is that they are conflated with their regular counterparts  which is all kinds of wrong.toxic masculinity does not equate to  masculinity. they re very different things even if somewhat related.  couldn t get the striked through coding to work  hence the edits. as for what toxic masculinity is  its when the concept of masculinity gets tainted by machismo and misogyny at minimum  least from my pov.  there are other aspects  but this is going to be long enough as is and Im not writing an essay on the topic. just like toxic femininity has misandry as an aspect.  think frosk .youreferenced your dad. did he ever put you down  tried to downplay what you did  Im guessing a hard no. thats because in regular masculinity there s no need for such behaviour  its nigh anathema to it to begin with.in toxic masculinity on the other hand... well.. its tuesday  if you catch my drift.or let s use another example  fictional this time. btvs. tony harris  father to alexander  xander  harris was an example of toxic masculinity. putting down his son  verbally  emotionally and had been physically abusive to boot in the past. enough so  that xander preferred sleeping in the yard during Christmas.... on a hellmouth where beings live that think humans are happy meals on legs and he continued to do so even after he learned the truth of his town  until he finally moved out.so yeah toxic masculinity is a thing  its just not what the current day yahoo s think it is and thus they are making a mess of things.although I wouldn t discount your control hypothesis as its definitely plausible in my eyes.
now this is a surprise! disney isn t going to flush another half million down the toilet on a remake nobody wants I refuse to watch birds of prey. it looks like trash and to be honest  I am a huge cassandra cain fan and what they did to her character is revolting to me.
yes amber was lying  disney should sue her for losing money on movies they end up not doing
Im all for an original movie about female pirates  history has quite a few infamous female pirates. in fact the most successful pirate ever was ching shih  a female pirate who had somewhere around 80000 followers.   and thats just one example  so this trend of taking already established ip s and swapping all the male lead roles with female ones because of  female empowerment  and  representation  at the expense of male erasure needs to just stop. Im so tired of the woke agenda as no one asked for it.
they must have got that one million alpaca order delivered.
all things have a dark side. the masculine urge to protect and provide for can be corrupted into unhealthy levels of control. the feminine urge to nurture can be corrupted in the same way. both are necessary to balance one another.
I dont get why they feel the need to use the same license and just change it to a female. like just make an original film at that point. it adds nothing to the film. just because youre a female lead doesnt make it new or original or better. that takes acting skill  good writing  interesting plots. but no that would take too much money and work to do  when you can just swap a gender and call it a day. I hate this whole gender swap for new movies  its so damn lazy. also itseems to only happen for male swapped to female  its weird  you never see it the other way around. imagine an alien reboot with a male lead  that would be fucking stupid lol.
selene ftw
the showrunners writers have no real life experience  they live in their fantasies. but fail to realize what sales fantasy is that it has some foundation in reality. why not use mary read and anne bonny for a foundation to build from they were real pirates oh I forgot you have to read some history instead of living in your phone. great job mel  best wishes.
I love your videos. not trying to stand up for the marvel gender swap  but all of these female characters have been around for a long time in the comics now. spoiler alert jane foster lady thor  probably wont been seen again. also I think another reason they are replacing the male leads. is that the actors are getting too expensive to cast and they are getting older and its harder to get and stay in shape. so  marvel studios hires a bunch of female actress to play the  female  counterpart at Im assuming half the cost as the male leads. Imay be wrong.  I could go on a bit longer but I will keep my comic nerdyness to my self. dont flame me  but I agree with your videos most of the times.
didn t gena davis already do a female pirate movie called cutthroat island  they should do a reboot of that where she passes the torch on to a successor
just had a bird of prey hawk .swoop down on my truck talons out beak open darndest thing .smack dab into the windshield it also was a flop maybe it thought the wipers were something
female pirate movies -- how about geena davis  cutthroat island  1995    not necessarily the best movie and was pretty much a bust at the boxoffice  but its fun and entertaining ... and both my wife and I enjoyed it.btw  if women are supposedly smarter  then why in the hell would they want to live trapped on a tiny boat for months at a time  trying to survive as pirates -- sounds pretty stupid to me.
idk girl pirate movie sounds cool to me
let a man write the stories for the female superheroes. I know it would be sacrilege to the uber woke  femi-nazI  man hating writers in hollywood these days but we ve seen how poor their talent pool is.  way too often they haven t succeeded and by reading the last bunch of comments by she-hulk director  cast and writers they dont seem to be taking their jobs very seriously. let s face it this scared disney off from making a film that will likely cost 100 million to make and another 58-80 to promote. can it recoup like 350 million which would be their measure of success I estimate...no I doubt it not in the ugly mood people are in right now.
I wouldn t mind margot as a female pirate captain in one of the potc movies. that would be fine. but not an all  female  ripoff of the potc franchise. thatship wont sail.
well at least they have saved themselves from embarrassment.
ghost busters reboot  birds of prey  charlie s angels robot  oceans 8   and every time marvel makes an all female  girl powers unite  scene  funny enough  underworld  lara croft   and alien were brilliant  and sufficiently original blockbustersan politically motivated  all female pirates of the caribbean further tied to writers of birds or prey would ve been doomed before takeoff.
I actually liked cutthroat island.
this is too bad. I like margot robbie. she is from australia and could have a good pirate accent. not every new take is bad. prey was good. if anything it wasn t woke enough.an indian would have natural hunting skills. plus she had good development. wining at the end from dumb luck and the lack of skill of the predator hunter...nah she should have blindsided him with an arrow  boulder  trap something.
guaranteed  this movie would ve never been better than the pr0n parody movie....and margot robbie is a five at best.
how about jonny depp and margo robbie awesome.
I really wanted she hulk to do well she has a great comic but what they did to her ill never forgive marvel for destroying the she hulk for me.
thank God this never materialized!!!!
look up cut throat island  its one of the biggest movie flops in history! cost 94 million to make only made 10 million. critical and financial fail and sank the movie company that made it. no one wants to associated with that movie.
@hamanu666  yeah I know it flopped   but at least its an established storyline that makes sense
they jumped the gun by sacking johnny depp they dug there grave.
man I want to get my life together so I can get me a tattoo gaming girlfriend   like her also she is Christian conswevative bonus points  I ll make myself worthy of this life one way or the other
rip masculinity
it would have bombed so bad. are they coming to their senses or cant afford to lose more money
Jesus Christ  thank God
no jack sparrows no pirates of the caribbean
the word  virtue  comes from the latin word  vir . latin vir   man
remember  cutthroat island  1995
davey jones welcome s them
well when shit goes wrong they all look for the masculin man because he can save their lives.
black panther comic is like knightfall when batman couldn t be batman got a substation black panther until got he ready
mel youre the best person on the earth and I like you but listen to me when I say that even though margaret robbie makes a good harley quinn dont forget the tara strong is the original voice of harley quinn lol
can you check out  alita battle angel  and do a review on your channel
thor being made into a female was it for me. never bothered with the last movie. smh.
did disney finally wake up. surprising.this movie would have failed yes.I dont even trust them with a johny depp movie by now
they knew it was gonna bomb horrendously awful
.. a different kind of story .. I really doubt that. it was going to be exactly the same kind of story  but with more women.
gena davis! cutthroat island! and long kiss goodnight!
why mess over older stories movies  why not just write new stories movies  or is that to difficult today
coming next ... the remake of gladiator with a woman playing the rule of maximus! take that  patriarchy!
I love that movie
all the water puns
yesssssssssssss!!!!!!!!!
Im in the same boat.. movies are terrible because everyone rides the coat tales of all our movies from the past. make a story of your own and stop trying to add parts to movies that are amazing on their own. stooooopp making sequels for the love of God. I really feel that movies are coming to their end of life. no one has an original thought  these days.
algorithm bump
who s gonna take a female pirate seriously  what s she gonna do  threaten to talk to them about her day for hours til they surrender

next up willa wonka and chocolate factory musical remake with gene and depp s character replaced by a woman like beyonce .  p  joking around obviously
I like your hair - apologies if weird statement
female pirates of the caribbean is too much feminism  so how about charlys angels with only male characters now suddenly companies  wanting make all women products.also pirates of the caribbean is johnny deep without  him cant called it that way.
cool sleeve tattoo...and others....messy 90s hairstyle...honest...I will like and comment and thank you!
I lost interest in pirate movies quite a while back. even with depp  I doubt I d have watched it.
nice to meet someone else who is a female Christian who likes video games. I like solo rpg games or I d ask you play something with me online.
ohh how about a remake of cutthroat island!!! its got pirates and a female lead  !!!
there was a female pirates of the carribean it was a porno
well I guess in this case they should recast harley quinn as a male
welp  most girls dont like action with superhero moviesthey made sure that no boys are allowed anymore...I do wonder how will they make money !
who the hell would even touch this terrible idea with a 10 foot poll
thank God
calico jack is a female
wasnt there an adult film names pirates  would have laughed  if they shot this film and all those seo would have led to a porn movie hahaha
its like they dont know about anne bonny or mary read.  you know  real female pirates.
man  let s get a movie of actual badass ladies like the night witches or something or lady death  stop replacing dudes just because.
any pirate movie would get attention  they wanted seemingly a rip off version..thats where they webt wrong. I would love to see a new good pirate movie.
please leave a comment on sydney watson s latest video on tomboy.
nope. no thanks.  nojohnnynopirates
just wondering a man playing harley queen....lol
I know the feminine agenda is getting out of hand but if its margot robbie in the lead Im watching regardless
they tried a pirate movie with a female lead  it was called cutthroat island with gina davis and the movie flopped
she should have mentioned how trump was going to play the villain. instant green light.
love you
oh no!anyway
hopefully this is a sign johnny is coming back and if so he gets shit ton of money
female lead pirate movie  cutthroat island with gina davis  though its apparently not well liked  I rather enjoyed it.
oh no anyway
didn t you block @therealrtu
wanna watch a good pirate movie checkout cutthroat island
she really hurt her brand making thatshitty birds of prey movie. ewen mcgregor seems will sign on the dotted line for anything with a paycheck too lately. but margot deserves better than table scraps. she needs to be more selective to stay relevant in the industry.
good
always found the wording of female led pirates of the caribbean strange. was kiera knightly not a woman when she was in all 3 movies  and became progressively more assertive as they went on
well if they replace the men with females with big boos and skimpy armors outfits   we guys   wont be too unhappy....ahahahahaha
we won
Christina hudson   why do these mega-corps keep hiring new writers of movies  that already have shows that have failed   rings of power s screenwriters are in the same boat.  giving them chances is easy to agree with  but a supposed blockbuster with a mega-million     budget  is a bit too far to the distortion of mine.
what !creating a new interesting story instead of stealing someones other story an inject it with all the woke shit  why would anyone want to create anything new  it will fail if it will be woke and without a iconic movie name.
I rather a og female pirate movie. something with a good story thats wont be just because I am female. I rather see those pirate girls from anything like one piece  final fantasy ect.
woo!
why is the female black panther a unique situation   literally all of those female characters have had existing stories.  they are actual preexisting characters.
look up jack sparrow vs kratos. your welcome
oof!
the only place u dont see woke nonsense is horror movies but one day jason will be nonbinary
lost all respect for this woman.  if she had any integrity she would have refused the part.  by taking it  she condoned discrimination and defamation and shat in every legit abuse victim.
potato sack pirate holds no appeal.
I think its more to do with a pirates film without jd is dead in the water it just isn t the same franchise without him.oh the writer of birds of pray film as working on this  thank God this was cancelled.
case and point  the female ghostbusters was awful.  underworld and tomb raider are amazing
clearly there were no real pirates who were women in the history of piracy    thats why we cannot make a movie about mary read or annie bonny.      r.g.
when it got to her marvel female super hero section she was super  wrong. all of those characters are from the comic books Goddamn it  please read them .
me too is a continuing financial disaster for hollywood.
why bother with an all female cast pirates of the caribbean when one already exists. its called pirates starring jesse jane
good lol. tired of these strong woman who hates men roles tbh. can we just have some low key  princess bride  vibes sometimes
maybe hollywood learned from the feminist disaster that was the female ghostbusters.
has margot robbie been in a fucking  frame  of a decent movie since  wolf of wall street   she seems to be a born supporting actress hollywood is desperately trying to blow up into a lead.
hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha !!!!!!!!!!!!!
this is the problem with franchises in general.... everyone thought it was strange when they started this thing with that name  nowadays they wont even start anything new without an old name.... does no one in the industry see how destructive this is  if you never make anything new there wont ever be a new star franchise.... this just sounds so redudctive. if you want some female franchise  write it  make it good  stop fing summoning the graves of older shit and putting a wig on it
even with johnny depp as jack sparrow in it the last pirates of the c. movie was kinda trash so.... without him it would be even worse I am afraid.
nobody was asking for this movie. I dont even want to see another depp potc ...... these series need to stop devolving into cash grab hell ..... I cant think of the last time they got better as they went along. jurassic park remains the best jurassic park movie ....
just get a history textbook and find someone interesting then write a film Imean is historical drama not a thing
ahaha omg
I love watching woke stuff burn
tchala is a man after all....lol
there are actually many historical female pirate... make a movie about one of them .. ffs..
geez. what s wrong with making an original pirate comedy movie with a girl being the lead  why does it have to be an existing franchise that has a guy  is  franchise  the proper word  same with the black girl being the little mermaid. what s wrong with having her in an original storyline
why dont they just write a new story. its not that hard. how about a movie where jones has twin daughters. one is smart like him but a bit of a coward and the other is brave like him  but a bit of an idiot. it can be a story of accepting yourself and learning to grow.the plot can be that jones was said to be lost in a cave in while fighting the nazis in antarctica. he found proof that would make hollow earth theory a fact. not only that  he found technology that far surpasses that on the surface  teleporters  personal flight units that allow you to fly freely through the sky  optical camouflage  eye implants that allowed one to see through any surface and analyze every property  fragments of the true excalibur etc while trying to escape  he grabbed some samples of the above  including a real philosophers stone. one of a batch of millions.when he touched one  something no one dared to do  a side effect is that he is aged backwards to his younger years and his eyes take on a iridescent hue. still reeling from his appearance  he is found  captured and frozen in time to be studied to see if the effects can be replicated.his daughters set out to find him and run into echos of his past self along the way. I d watch that. wouldn t you
pirates of the kitchen
God none of this appeals to me.  and not because they are women I love entertainers of all backgrounds  creeds and genders.  this does not appeal to me because these are weird equivalent of beloved characters who have been gender swapped to push a message  not because it makes the film better and not because we wanted it.  its like saying  you like banana spit with vanilla ice cream   well  eat this apple tart with chocolate ice cream.  it is the same as the thing you love  its ice cream and fruit and if you dont like it...well...then there s definitely something wrong with you.   if hollywood is so hell bent on making films that focuses on diverse casting  then put the focus on content that is actually good first and write the diversity into it  instead of taking already successful and beloved ips and changing them to become unrecognizable and gaslighting the audience into thinking it is their problem for not liking it.  its not a difficult concept.
fucking assassin s creed managed an interesting female pirate character. but then  black flag was the best of them all  so....
were they all women  what is a woman
oh no  I was reeeaaallly looking forward to seeing a bunch of skinny 5ft women beat up 6ft men.
glad this woke reboot was cancelled. the pirates franchise is worthless without johnny depp.
what are you talking about  robbie was great in suicide squad. the only thing bad about that movie was jared leto s joker. cringe
not to forget ocean s eight .. huge female flop on the ocean s eleven take.
women replacing men in action movies. men replacing women in women s sport.
arr!
honestly  Im so sick of seeing feminism embodied on the screen I just watch old stuff like commando  predator  alien  terminator  arnie being bought by wokeism notwithstanding  and the like. I wont pay money to see any of this new fem first men last crap.
this woman is clearly trying so hard to appeal to incels and edgeLords
what is a female led story that doesnt have a feminist agenda
Im really trying to understand why you blocked me from instagram... just because I had opposite religion views..  I never said anything bad and I also agreed and commented positive things...eh  you are free to do so  its your space. such a shame tho.
the only thing anyone thinks of when those pirates movies are mentioned is cap n jack. thats it. they could recast it with little people but if there s no cap n jack nobodies going to go see it. make it all women its so obvious pandering that its offensive.
hahahahaha I didnt even know they were tring to make a shitty woman version of pirates of the carribean. lol what a bad idea that was. why cant we all just be normal human beings
sorry  but with an all female cast pirates movie I can only think of porn..
happy this died. not only for depp but also for margot robbie s career. this thing would have been a potential career killer for her  and she s a far better actress than to sully her resume with a pathetic woke reboot of the pirates franchise.
this whole idea of having an all-woman cast  just as something new  hasn t been  new  since charlie s angels in the 1970s. come up with something original.
of course it got cancelled  as usual lazy and activist writers have gender bended it and made it garbage.
absolutely no one wanted that garbage
good  I dont really like margot robbie and her overrated harley quinn gig.
birds of prey was a horrible movie which is not worth losing that time from your life.
for having an opinion that men and women should have equal respect in film representation  I think not.not once did she ever undermine women in her video- as a woman myself I think what she s saying makes perfect sense. film roles should never be gender swapped just for the sake of feminism  what depth or value does that add to any character  it just makes for a hollow regurgitation of the same source material  and people are sick of seeing that. they re sick of seeing roles in movies  that were great the way they were  be twisted in the name of  wokeness . any film thatseeks to truly give women inspiring roles should create new and thoughtful roles for their female characters  not recycled versions of male roles. the latter is just insulting  in my opinion!anyways  no potc could ever thrive without johnny- thats simply facts. no johnny  no potc. edit  sorry this is such a long response  Im extremely passionate about this topic haha
