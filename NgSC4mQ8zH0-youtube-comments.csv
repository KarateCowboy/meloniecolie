melonie  Imet my wife when she was 24 and she didn t want kids at all. after 6 years together she changed her mind and wanted to have children. so things can change as life changes. unfortunately she died at 37 from cancer and left a 5 year old and a month shy of 2 year old behind. never take anything for granted  if you meet someone and want to have kids go ahead and do it. if you dont and youre content in your life  thats fine as well. just live your life like its the last day you have  cause we never really know.
as a 33 year old uncle of 2 beautiful girls myself  it is breathtaking the joy one feels when seeing our newly born family members. I hope you had an amazing day  and Im sure the baby will be an amazing person. be the funny weird aunt! best wishes!
I remember when my nephew was born. we got the call at about 3 o clock in the morning  jumped in the car and drove about an hour to the hospital. he was ten minutes old when we got there.that was five years ago. now he s entering the first grade and a total trip!congrats!
now thats what I call a pro gamer move
I have 7 sisters and 4 brothers  I am 44 years old and I am an uncle to a lot of nephews and nieces and I am a Godfather as well.  melonie  I hope you do find that right guy for you who will both respect you and your beliefs and that you will get to experience the joys of being a mom yourself one day. I always keep you in my thoughts and prayers  my old friend.
dont give up hope yet  girl. both my mother and my stepmother had healthy boys in their 40s. dont deprive yourself of that joy if you can help it. its definitely magical  holding your newborn. you develop a bond that is the most unbreakable thing imaginable. I ll send a prayer that you find the right dude.
congratulations on being an aunt. I have had the recent joy of becoming a first time uncle  so I share your excitement.  I wouldn t marry my cat  but wouldn t give her up without a fight.
Im 33 years old and am currently just an uncle. my uncle was almost 50 when he had his daughter and parenthood is just as fulfilling for him as it is for anyone. I know social pressures are a little different for women  but kids forever attach you to someone  you want to make sure its the right person. imagine how johnny would feel if he had kids with amber turd.
newborns are special and it just means more with family. you will always be a part of their lives. here s this tiny new member of the family that wasn t there just minutes ago. its amazing and your excitement is awesome! be sure to take a picture with him and the overwatch hat so he wont forget that he s had a cool gamer aunt since birth
aww melonie this was such a happy and positive video from you !! you had a uplifting cat and owner story  and you sharing becoming a auntie and your pet cat  cole train ending your video. and finally I just want to say you dont have to worry about the what the other side of people are doing I think keeping focus and being positive  would unlock your happiness in life.
grats on becoming an aunt !Ive been lurking on your channel for a bit now since quartering mentioned you and its a good time to finally comment   about the topic of finding a partner I can relate. Im 37  hitting 38 in few months  and still looking for my other half. I dont look for an  ideal woman   just someone  right for me  but its not a  no matter what  issue for me. unfortunately even in my ex-commie sh!thole on the other side of the planet  society is trying to copy paste a lot from  the west . quite a lot women here mindlessly mimic the worst behaviors. Ive become quite blackpilled about it but women like you are giving me hope and a healthy dose of a  white pill    about being mom at 35   natal treatments advanced a lot and help keep women and children healthy during the pregnancy in most cases. so biology is one thing but medicine advancements is another. the most important is finding a person you are sure you want to create this new life with. beside that you look really youthful and healthy. before you mentioned your age few videos ago I wouldn t give you more than 25. you ve also mentioned you dont drink and that I think is a big factor here. alcohol is a killer when it comes to aging.anyway  stay awesome and keep being you
I have two dogs and other than my family I love them more than anything. I take marriage very seriously  so I wouldn t marry either of them but I would live on the streets with my dogs before giving them up. congratulations on becoming an aunt again and I wish you safe travels!
the love in this is hard not to admire even if its weird and something I wouldn t do
congrats on becoming an aunt! being an aunt is the best - all of the fun  little of the responsibility   its ok if you dont end up having kinds  life can be full without them as well.and as we have seen  if a suitable partner cannot be found  one can always marry a cat  or a hologram  these days
props to the lady who took a big step to save her pet. no need for you to marry your cat. you ll have someone good. great job on the Bible quote  too. being a creative is a great way to show the good. you create food and you create your journalism videos. youre doing really well with it. keep being you because youre awesome.
Im in the same boat as you when it comes to relationships. but I love how you say you might just be an aunt in the end. itshows that you aren t desperate like a lot of people who seem to be afraid of how people view them. who cares how the world sees us! people will judge you either way. anyway  keep growing your faith and let me know if you want to date haha  d
congratulations on becoming an auntie. wish I had an auntie that was as cool and fun as I know you are. very happy for the family to have a healthy baby boy. p.s. go steelers
I would be devastated if someone tried forcing me to give up my cat after all these years.
my friends have had kids. a bunch of them. and throughout the years  Ive never really felt a real connection with them. they are just kids  and they aren t mine. they are all good kids  and if any of them ever need anything from me  all they have to do is ask. but Im pretty neutral on them  in the same way Im neutral on other peoples  pets  more or less. there isn t any urge for me to be around or be an uncle to any of them.then my sister had a kid  and that was a totally different experience. for the first time in my life  I felt genuinely connected to humanity. I know thatsounds weird  but now I  have someone I d give everything to if I had to  and thats really weird and also pretty awesome. so I get how you feel about your nephew  melonie
married her cat  wow she put a bell on it
Im sorry for your loss.
preach! exactly  I know so many people who had kids with the wrong person  half of my family is like that  and its so sad!
your dad is right
you have the right outlook on having kids.  from what little I know of you  you would be a good mother.  you will meet your man when it is time.  your nephew is adorable.  auntie mel.
congratulations on becoming an auntie .I hope all is ok and goes well for you allllll
its funny how mental issues are celebrated like they are something to be envied. this woman s hold be institutionalized.
I really love your attitude about finding the right one and having kids. I have never had a girlfriend in my life but it is about finding the person. if it is God s will then he will bring the right person to you.
lost her job as a life coach  gee  I wonder why.oh  right  the fact thatshe is completely insane.
congrats on becoming an aunt! that is awesome! also  would you happen to have a recipe for those chicken enchiladas !
love the videos  congrats on becoming an aunt!!
this also sort of reminds me of the story about the guy who married a pillow  the woman who married herself  and the woman who married a roller coaster.
I dont see why she just doesnt find a pet-friendly property to rent  temporarily staying with friends or airbnb in between moving if necessary. and if this as legally binding  somebody should really look into patching this loophole. overall  at least her reasoning is  marginally better the people who ve  married  inanimate objects in the past. looking forward to the meat keto lasagna recipe!
I wanted to have a family and do the family man thing  even tried with 2 different women. both of them used me as an 18 year passive income  pretty crazy when you think about it. they pretend they want thebsame thing  then you give them the child they we wanted and immediately just dip out. im not even 40 and I have an adult child.id love to actually raise a family just once  but I cant picture finding someone I could trust enough again in the future. I know thats my own issue  it just sucks. and Im scared to death for my son
I had nothing to lose so Imarried my cat.  if thats not the saddest statement ever spoken in the english language I dont know what is.
such a sweet episode. loving the verse of the day.
meanwhile  the cat escaped thru the window screen
its good to have a faithful companion
you may now feed the cat.
congrats  so happy to hear the little guy and mama are healthy.  family is wealth.  God bless!
I was thinking just what your dad said. if you love your animal enough to marry it  move! also  how are humans allowed to marry animals  I saw something yesterday about a guy who married a virtual game girl
not only is it a female cat  but its also disabled. we re really going for maximum inclusivity here
Im with dad on this one.
I was really hoping those crazy kids would work things out
Imean  she just did it to keep her pet  not because she wanted to actually have a relationship or anything  also its not like they married at church or anything serious  so no  Imean  its cool  unlike other people who take it too far and actually feel attracted to animals or feel like animals  now thats weird
@eric maganaÂ  literally no evidence that this will help her keep her pet.animals cant consent.
@nym onefoursixÂ  aight
@eric maganaÂ  if the landLord doesnt want pets in the property then marrying that pet wont change anything.
@nym onefoursixÂ  I guess I didnt hear the reasons correctly
bahahaha
your dad sounds hillarious. oh   btw  think youre tired now  wait till you start pulling aunt baby-sitting duties
1 08 when you thought this was going to be a personal story.I d like to have kids  but I dont know if I want to bring anyone into this world the way things are going and there are tons of kids here already that just need to feel loved and wanted though. what I really want most is to have 1 or 2 kids with the right woman and then continually adopt or foster more kids. I think a Christ-like heart especially should want to adopt some of the  unwanted  children.
watched the outro like 3 times. too cute. yes  I am a man  but I said it anyway!
youre definitely right about women having children well into their 40s. look at sara  she was an old lady when she had isaac.
these last couple of videos through the week has truly been on another level.
a new twist on  mad dogs and englishmen . three legged cats and englishwomen. makes me proud to be british.
lol you killed me with the way you said  girl . instantly made me think of kanye s workout plan! love the channel btw!
two animal videos in one week.  oh my.  may your days continue to be blessed.
being the same age  I dont have any kids and with my brain disease  it wouldn t be fair to both the child and wife if something happens to me in the next year or two.
I hope you like babysitting.  it would really help out.  Im getting baby pictures for one that was born in december and another in february.  having two hours of sleep at a time gets old pretty fast.
as a single person with no dependents or deductions  I always wanted to adopt my cat as a child so I can get some tax breaks.  Im currently paying through the nose when it comes to income taxes and could use a discount.
hey melonie I just want to say that congrats to you for being a new aunt to your new baby nephew. also I saw the pictures on twitter of you holding your new baby nephew and I just want to say that your baby nephew is so cute   adorable and handsome baby boy that I ever saw on twitter. anyway I just want to say that bout your new nephew and tell you congrats to you for being a new aunt  ok melonie. anyway getting back to this topic of woman marrying the cat that if she was having a renting a house problems thatshe should ve had a job to get paid more and have enough money to pay off for house rent bill instead of marrying a animal to stay at her house for lifetime  ok melonie. anyway I just want to make a comment bout this story bout woman marrying her cat and I just want to say and tell you that congrats to you   I am soooooo freaking happy for you for being a new aunt  ok melonie. anyway hope you have a wonderful   great blessed evening   have a good night   have a great time visiting with your new baby nephew  ok melonie. anyway have a great day   evening melonie.
aww! -- congrats! I was in my mid-30s when I first became an uncle  too. now she s on a learner s permit and eyeing my rav4. the age it burrrrnnns!!  g  but my nieces are awesome.
congratulations  auntie melonie!
my late grandmother couldn t make a lasagna without it being half an inch higher than the edge of the pan--no matter how large or deep the pan was.  we tested this several times.
also  can a cat consent to marriage  wouldn t you need a dr doolittle assist for that
this is the third weirdass  marriage  Ive heard about this week! a tower  a doll  and a cat - wtf is going on
in a perfect world melonie would be hosting x-play on a proper reboot of g4.
she has kids.. so they re step  mom  is a cat now
saaaame
congratulations on your nephew  kids are a joy! is it time to change the channel name to tia melonie
melonie  have you heard about clutchbelk   the canceled warzone streamer  he was called sexist for trash talking a female streamer during a tournament. nothing he said to her was something he wouldn t have said to a male in the same situation. people also blamed him for things his chat said in other streams about the situation.  it has cost him tens of thousands of dollars. he used to have videos on his twitch channel explaining his side of things  but I think he took them down.
congrats on the being an aunt   fun times. I was a month late lol I didn t too come out lol.
daaaammmmnnnn melonie keep cooking like that you are going to get yourself a good italian guy!
wow their honeymoon is gonna be totally awkward
well this happened in england so not sure what the actual law would be over there.here in the us you could just have the cat declared a support animal and they couldn t force you to remove it in most states. I think she has a bigger problem if she has no money and cant pay the rent however.
you know what   I agree with you  wholeheartedly.  I am 43  and still haven t really found someone worth marrying  let alone have kids with.  to be honest  this has lead to weird exchanges with family members  presuming either I am a misogynist or gay.  no  I am exceptionally picky about who I date or even who I would choose to marry.  because I dont casually date.  that is a contention that I have with my dad  who  used to  openly casually date women  he is on his 3rd marriage at this point .  he even disastrously attempted to set me up with either women he was interested with  or daughters of women who he has dated in the past.  thats a big nope  he and I are as different as the sun and moon about this.Ive been engaged twice and admittedly  the first one fell apart because of me  and the second fell apart because I caught her cheating on me by accident  that was a decade ago  and she is married now  but cheats on her current husband  so I dodged a bullet there .    the first engagement was 20 years ago  and the last was a decade ago.  just to point out how picky I am  I only dated 2 women after the split  in the past 10 years.  either way  I am courting with a brazilian woman now.  I am about 18 years older than her  and she would literally be the first woman that Ive chosen who was younger than me.we will see how this goes....   decades of disappointment has left me jaded.
youre uh... youre joking about marrying your cat  right  d  gets ready to add prayer against bestiality to prayer list
you sure the ladies these days dont have impossible standards  I dont believe  for instance  that there is only one  soul mate  for every person. rather  I believe that there are many people with whom you could potentially have a lasting relationship. the only way to find out is date someone and see how long it lasts.
your cat that just video-bombed you looks exactly like my cat  moorwen.
holyspirit Godbless you melonie
I ll be honest  I think that  marrying  your pet is completely wacked out but I would much rather be around cats or dogs than a lot of people out there.
pretty sure I dont want to live on this planet anymore.
your fertility is good but hold out on a man you want to have a family with. family is everything. hold the fort until you find a foundation to build your city on yoooo
bruhhh... I know she wanted to save her cat  but marrying her cat is way too much... there had to be another way...
seems like people provide more supporting arguments for reinstating stoning as a form of punishment every day.
anytime you want to start that rapture Jesus. also way to rock the flat rim mac!
papa is right I  m not marrying my dog or a cat I draw the line kids lmao
itseems to me that cat lady just wants to avoid finding a pet friendly rental property  pet deposits  and pet rent.this has happened to her multiple times  yet she still continues to make the dubious decision to violate her rental agreements. I say just evict her with violation of no pet policies in her lease agreement as the reason so future landLords will find out about her disregard for rental agreement clauses and avoid renting to a problem tenant.I see no reason to respect her decisions nor tolerate her behavior.
remember when melonie was teasing us with pix of the dishes when she was making them last night...mmm  somebody put this woman in the wife-bag
I dont get why she didn t apply for universal credit or hardship funds to help cover rent  also human animal releationships are illegal because the animal itself cannot give consent at all
hopefully it works out!
same
I see it the same way  you either move in somewhere that allows pets  or you dont. sadly I know far too many people who like bigish dogs and dont train them so it would be hell living somewhere that allows pets for me.
love your channel so I ll forgive the steelers tank top.
my cousins son is due on saturday but its bittersweet as my cousins dad died 2 weeks ago from cancer.
how canthat be a legal marriage
because the new spiderman animated movie is coming out with preggo spderwoman  can you ask your sister or sister-in-law if she d crime-fight while carrying her child  I need irl perspective.
guess they dont have therapy pets in the old world
its funny because from a physical standpoint we are pretty insignificant in the universe when you think about its vastness. david even said at psalms 8 3  4   when I look at your heavens  the work of your fingers  the moon and the stars  which you have set in place  what is man that you are mindful of him  and the son of man that you care for him   but God still values us  as you said and as david went on to discuss. its pretty wonderful. and thanks for sharing that verse today.
dig that overwatch hat. looks good.
I replied to someone s now deleted comment once  you and Imay be insignificant to the vast majority of the world but that doesnt mean we are any less important. we are important to someone in our lives.  its me again  mr. new vegas  reminding you that youre nobody  til somebody loves you. and thatsomebody is me. I love you.  - mr. new vegas
melonie mac   being a dude I avoid some women there s some good women out there but I really hate cancel culture even the metoo movement I dont know what ruin s it    _   _   .  you give me hope though God bless you man strength is key in life  good video !
coltraine is so cuuuuuute!
this shows how broken the marriage system truly is.  marrying an animal that cant officially consent is weird af.  if you can marry your cat  you can marry anything.  obviously its just a legal title in this case  but still.thatsaid  its not as messed up as a family being unable to find afford a place to live that would allow a cat.  essentially  one messed up thing is being done to overcome an even worse thing.  hooray for pets!
an amazing man just dont hold out for thor!or blastoise.
so l m wondering if the cat agreed to this
yo melanie  I need the recipe to the second dish please
I understand not wanting to give up a pet  but at the end of the day  she s a tenant and does not own the property. if the owners dont allow pets they dont allow pets. she should find somewhere that does allow pets. trying to guilt-trip the landLord and exploiting legal loopholes like this just makes the woman come off as incredibly entitled and selfish.
you know...  this is kind of weird  but as a dog-daddy  I totally get it.  I d do anything for my two little girls.
a way to a man s heart is his stomach. food looks good
keep in mind...meek does not mean weak. moses knew in advance that he could pull down the finger of God at a moment s notice  but he was very humble about the relationship between him and God...which makes sense because why would God want a vain and boastful servant
does marrying a cat make her a crazy cat lady
baby s are cool but its a totally different feeling when its a baby in your own family like close family  its like  look a baby  and Im like  wow cool  but with my nieces and nephews its just different they are more fun then just some baby like a kitten is cool but a kitten in your family is amazing  off topic but why it an adult cat a cat but a baby cat is a kitten and if a kitten is a baby cat then shouldn t an adult kitten be a kat     really someone answered this for me cus thinking of it I dont really get it or like it.
somebody had to say it
my condolences for your loss .
@ripperroo92Â  thank you
blastoise us my guyyyy
I would say insane.....but ok
here is my advice.  best case - get pregnant with your last kid in your 20s.  if you get pregnant the day before 30.  thats best case.  then stop.but I had a kid at 39.  and thats not a major problem.  but its harder.and its like - if she goes to school for 4 years after high school.  Im going to be 61 when she s sort of ready to take on the world.  and  by that time  Im thinking - its time to think about retirement.
God bless you
10 41 because the most obvious examples of wokeness  to say them  make you sound like a horrible person. this crap is death by 1000 cuts  none of them are major enough to kill you but they add up. and as for how they get all the same talking points  wokeies are a collective  they all follow each other and when they see others using a tactic thatseems to work they all adopt it fast. this is an issue for antI woke because unlike them they dont function as a collective so it takes time for something to stick  and by the time it does  see florida  the machine already labeled it one thing and no amount of saying what it actually is counters that.
so who s her life coach
is this a thing thats being allowed  wasn t this kind of thing illegal or something. is it even legally recognized  either way this is just wrong  but I keep hearing more and more cases of people marrying inanimate objects.on a side note  I thought this was a gaming news channel. this is the second human animal relations topic you ve brought up within a short period of time.
if she cant pay rent   marrying a cat doesnt change that fact.  she still owes the money.  if she ends up on the street   homeless shelters dont accept animals.  the state doesnt recognize that as a legal marriage.  you might have 10 years if you have the money to pay for it.  good on you for not being willing to have kids with just anyone.  we should choose our kids parents.
she married what !
that poor cat
wonder how their honeymoon was. lolhow they know the cat gave consent to get married. hopefully the cat doesnt ever want a divorce after all gets half the stuff.
wait..you are 35  no way. really  I honestly thought  you are 25 or something like that.
melonie imagining the honeymoon
its my lady melonie!
enjoy and spoil your nephew. you will be a terrific aunt!
love the overwatch hat by the way  I wish you could leave a link in the description next time
I know women have different views but I am a 50 year old man  sloth  with no kids. funny enough a couple girls I have had relationships with were incapable of having any...  tubes tied and the other had medical issues . what will be  will be.
wait till that cat goes out to get a pack smokes and never comes back. or gets the next door kitten pregnant.
you dont have to consummate the marriage  I guess those guys with the lizard didn t get the memo.
if your going to marry a cat  make sure its a cat with money so if you loose your job you can still make rent.

we called this back in 2012
wasn t there a woman who was in a relationship with a tree though or so I heard. so this is less strange imo. least it was just a way to keep her

maybe you dont need the right guy. maybe you need the left guy.saying this standing over here in the left.
@melonie mac go boom     coltrane is probably asking    hooman  why dont you marry me
listening... I know those signs.  thats some fourth-dimension rambling.girl needs more sleep. -
avoided evection but get committed to an institution. likely
commenting to feed the algorithm...  the very  very strange algorithm
no have them about 21 to 38 get  all the fun  and bullshit  out of  the way and get more  life experience  and more  stability
people are getting very weird.
as someone who lives in southeast london I am disappointed... but not surprised.
boom!!
peak karen.
hey melonie I got a friend paco he loves you and wants to know if you want to marry him so he can get a green card and stay in the country.
I volunteer if you want babies
this world is f  ked
married or not  it has 4 legs and answers to  psst-psst-psst.  although I suppose its possible it uses a toilet instead of a litter box. its a pet. find a new place or give the animal to one of your kids.

melonie
hI  my name is amish mann... lets breed
steelers though
am I reading this right
ahhhh
its in england  the lunatics run the asylum here
@chrisÂ  down south maybe but in the north the normal people reign supreme
highs  lows  thick   thin
facepalm
oh hell no.  Im with your dad.  it demeans and degenerates marriage and its disgusting too.
does bring up the question about animals in rented accommodation. I think marrying the cat is a bit extreme but I understand why she did it. I would fight for my cat.
the f ck !
meow
btw have u seen the one with the uk woman marrying her dog on live tv
does this lady bot know that emotional support animals cant be removed due to ada compliance
know why beast sex is not allowed by law  because they cant consent. how can you marry something that doesnt give consent  its not like arranged marriages where the father gives consent either. this is abuse. also  what stops a woman from marrying her child so that cps cant take them  or a parent marrying a child to get out of child support  in any case  are such marriages consummated  playing with something sacred takes a sharp left off a steep cliff with a rapid drop.
although funny marriage is a sacrament and should never involve an animal lol
life coach   the fact thatshe married a cat might not look that good on her resume.  I personally wouldn t take life advice from her.   and dont you need an actual marriage license to get married.  where is peta   did the cat give consent   I am pretty sure cats consider humans beneath them  and I learned watching red dwarf that the consider marriage preposterous.
instead of getting married  maybe pay the rent
does no one care or remember what marriage is and means any more  this isnt cute. its mental and a disgrace to the sanctity of marriage.
what a hideous hat.
what about gaming content this is all political are you changing it up
dave-chapelle-modern-problems.jpg
is this the new form of therapy animal   people used to just put an orange vest with  therapy animal  on it and you could get away with taking your pet places that animals weren t allowed.  now you marry your pet and they cant evict it and take it where you want.  also  this women is a life coach!  do youreally want to take advice from someone who married her cat
england
interesting strategy
@melonie mac go boomÂ  or she could apply for universal credit
amen!
its camouflage.  she s hasn t slept in   days  etc.
she still takes gaming  but this channel is more social commentary than her main channel.
@thenotoriouscheetoÂ  ah I see
this is my social commentary channel I started a couple months ago  I talk about everything here. my  gaming  channel is melonie mac.
@melonie mac go boomÂ  ah. gotcha
