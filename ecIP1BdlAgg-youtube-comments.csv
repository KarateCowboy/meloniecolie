the immediate response we should give to  updated for modern audiences  is  no its updated to influence modern audiences .
these days  there s so much about the female figure thats being erased. as a woman with bigger breasts  being told Im not allowed to exist or that Im inherently lewd because of something biological I have no control over  Im so sick of this.
growing up as a teen in the 90 s  I cantell that lara croft was perfect for her audience.
imagine being born with naturally big breasts or wide hips and being branded as  not suitable for modern audiences   even if youre the most chaste girl around.
look updated for a modern audience  Im going to try using this more in my daily life.youre not ugly  youre just more suited for a modern audience.
5 28 - 90s lara croft was not nearly sexualised as much as her critics make it out to be  especially in the actual games as opposed to some of the promotional material at the time. more often than not the only people who see her as an objectified sex doll have never actually played any of the games from that era. they dont know anything about the character other than her recognisable appearance  and so ironically they are the ones projecting their own objectifying biases onto lara.
updated for a modern audience  pretty much means  if a girl has breasts  remove them    if you see skin  cover it   and  make someone gay or trans .
I subbed. finally a girl who actually likes video games and doesnt happen to just have an of. my little sister constantly complain about this. she hates that they keep making all the female characters in games thatshe wants to play look like dudes. she s a girl  she likes being a girl. when did it become so awful to be a man or a woman
as a woman with breasts on the bigger side I agree that picking a smart sporty choice of clothes with plenty of chest support for lara would make sense  since being active and keeping myself from having back pain on a daily basis due to my chest is a real thing... but I have no problem with her dressing in a way thatshows off her curves some skin. actually  if she picked clothes that were comfortable made her job easier and flaunted her personal fashion sense at the same time it would paint her as quite smart in my head  since having an eye for things that check both lists would require at least some basic sense of design. as it is  she looks like someone who just walked into a shop and bought a generic mix of yoga and trekking outfits.
the load of fear that modern games has to show feminine and sexy characters nowadays is simply insane. I agree with your perspective  mel.  this current version of lara croft simply doesnt remind what this character is a curvy  smart and beautiful woman who likes to study and solve ancient mysteries.
the strange thing is that the r34 creators appreciate lara infinitely more than the people who  update  games to fit today s sensibilities.
as a mid-30 s woman who is old enough to remember when the og tomb raider came out  the great thing about lara croft was thatshe was a beautiful  full breasted  small waisted woman who wasn t a helpless ditz  but could in fact do everything the men did and she did it 10x better!!
there is a huge difference between a hot girl dressing sexy and a girl selling her body for money.
ah yes  but the problem is they know they cant  just make a new character  because they know they will be unsuccessful.they can only corrupt what already exists.
lara being extremely capable  educated  and talented as well as being realistically sexy is all part of her image. no one in the  modern audience  is any of those things. since resident evil 4 remake being hyped the next controversy is going to be ada wong. she cant be a hot spy and be asian! thats fetishizing! but leon and luis being hunks are fine. eye candy
I love the warnings disney puts on their classic films. even movies from the 90s.
Im starting to believe that independent fan games of these famous games are going to be more and more popular because of these aaa studio practices. what do you guys think
only time croft s sexuality was acknowledged in the old games was the meta after credits scene where she shoots you for being a perv. if thats not the biggest power move I dont know what is.
I love how they keep using  the modern audience  as an excuse when the modern audience consistently hates these changes every - single - time.
real talk. its nice to see real women gamers  talking about the real shit...talking about what s happening around us. bravo. keep keeping it real.
boom
@melonie mac go boom  I understand your channel name now.
youre absolutely right
nailed it. I always wondered where s that modern audience they talk about if they keep sinking ships. turns out its a project.
@melonie mac go boom  hI  I like your videos.  3
like porn in school and drag shows for kids  this is supposed to be an attack on men
@kitty brown eye  yeah well actually Im a fan of both the classics and the reboot. sure I dont like that they got rid of her iconic dual pistols  her looks and the masterful soundtrack  such a shame  but at least they tried to be in the spirit of the game  which I still enjoyed quite much  though expected from the 2013 reboot a more coming of age to the classic tr story  which.... is not the case. Im afraid that this time  updated for a modern audience  means the incorporation of all the loony bin woke politics  like lara being a lesbian  a lesbian sex scene that nobody asked for  rainbow flags and signs all over the game  jonah smoking weed or something  like the bullocks they did in tlou2 and that the story is gonna be completely trash.Im currently writing a novel thats a bit of a combination of tr  indy j puzzles and action and a bit of the dan brown reality  meaning the places  the artifacts and the history I write into the novel are real places  real artifacts and real history and real technology of more then 2000 years ago that wouldn t be out of place in the early 1900 s... except that its from 200 bc instead of 1900 ad... with a little bit of creative liberty of course to link the story together... but the creative liberty is such a tiny pin drop that only an expert on the subject could recognize.
mean while the moder audience is the same audience from the initial release. thats why I say its better to wait 50 or 100 years before remaking something.
it could be worst  my dear  in my country  feminists call you  unnatural  unreal  body  so youre a ghost or something.
I love my big boob tomb raider  I found itso sassy  fun  and still adventurous. nothing about her body made the experience uncomfortable. its how we grew up with tomb raider. modern lara is kinda  well..idk she s so boring looking and I dont care to play with it now. I liked the first 2 games but meh.
yes  thank you
my wife is an attractive woman and I have watched for years the crappy treatment  backstabbing  and angry looks she gets from women jealous of her just because of her looks. my wife is an accountant and has earned every bit of her success even as jealous women tried to sabotage her all the way.  we both have to work out and stay healthy  giving up sitting on our butts and just eating donuts and believe me we would love to just kick back and magically be skinny and eat sugary goodness. so much of these hate mobs from the left is nothing but a bunch of losers pissed off other people are doing better than them. and it never occurs to them how hard we work and how much shit we get from them our whole lives. the lelftist mindset is founded in envy  jealousy  and greed. its no wonder they are so hateful and look the part.
I kind of think its a bit of an overreaction to think lara s new design eliminating her balloon boobs is an attack. to be honest her original design probably wouldn t work if modernized. it just inherently looks dated as far I cantell. and let s be fair I think if she was ever gonna be redesigned they were gonna remove her breast size because Imean there s no necessary reason for her breasts to even be that big since apparently it was an accident made by a designer and his team just said leave it in. I dont really mind either designs. every character gets redesigned  for better or worse and there s much worse.also I only call them balloon boobs because well I think the designers called them that.
@chandler burse  lara croft isn t the only character to get this treatment. Imean  look at tifa from ff7. look what theu did to lola bunny in the newest iteration of space jam. yes  polygonal boobs look outdated. but you can modernize something and not completely destroy the feminine aspects of a character. I didn t mind the design of lara so much in the last set of games  in all honesty. but this  I took one look at the new design and for some reason was immediately reminded of that beast woman from the last of us 2.
agree - and then they ll make the move to remove all references to the old content b c its toxic and offensive.
their  modern audience  is woke california  and silicone valley.
she said it!!!!
@stijnvdv2  hold up... laura croft had a lesbian sex scene  what game was that  Imusta missed it
well said
they downgraded her plot
accurate!
that means the same thing  really didn t say anything
that has the same philosophical substance as asking if you didn t tuck in your shirt  did you tuck your pants into your shirt. normally I would ignore this comment  but people are treating that person like they are socrates.
@kitty brown eye  porn in school  how  when  where
if they want to update a character  at least make them look good... croft looks like a man cosplaying.
thats not laura croft. its her mom. lolz
@david t  thats not lara croft. its her dad. lolz
every story or character is meant to influence you in some way  this is not insightful. it common sense
@the smartest ass  negative. entertainment doesnt need to influence. it just needs to have a good hero s journey story arc with room for positive character development.
@david t  you need to be influenced to care about it. you are influenced to laugh  cry  or think. they influence you into being entertained.
@david t  to influence someone is to make them do or think something. they need to influence you to see the movie and think you will enjoy it.
@david t  you can have a desire to be entertained  but someone has to influence you into trusting that they are capable of entertaining you. you are influenced to go to this theater or use this streaming service. you are influenced by the subject matter of the entertainment.
@ebe  lolz
if I say the word influence enough times maybe I can get someone to actually look into the meaning of the word. being entertained is a positive influence. you got the desired effect. if you can be entertained without influence thats fine  but not many are entertained by complete absence any stimuli.
@david t  good retort
@the smartest ass  its insightful  because it illuminates the implications of political influences behind the updated versions.
@the smartest ass entertainment  influence  and stimulI are three separate things not dependent of each other.trying to dilute the meaning of the word by using it in as many was as possible and associating it with other words is at least three different fallacies.
it would be less irritating if they were aware of how few people actually want this crap. they do this game after game and slaes drop. you d think theyd figure it out at some point people arent buying what they are selling.
@raggmopp 3377  I am honestly expecting them to kill off the disney animated movies once they finish with the reboots.
@kitty brown eye   you guys claim everything involving inclusion is an attack on men. talk about insecurity issues.
thousandth like.
@theandroids well its more than that  also there s mods ... she doesnt act confident and ba like she s supposed to either and despite them saying its cause its her early years she never got better.
ooor whenever we see these words   we need to immediately think    ooooh right!! so its not for me.  got it!! thanx!!
@theandroids in that case agreed.
@theandroids  if its so important a change her to resemble a flat chested dude  itshould be an optional setting for the supposed minority group who doesnt like the change. they seem to opperate under the flawed assumption the majority dont like women who have womenly features. a slider for those who want women to look like women should be available. women have breasts  a skeletal structure that doesnt resemble a male linebacker  and femininity.
@jd  check my other comment. exactly what I said. should be an option.
@graham clark an old and repeated excuse from those trying to justify changes in an ironic way.
@noah gooder  I hadn t thought of that  but I think youre right. disney already limits the release of their films so making them  unavailable.  so itsounds like something they would do.
exactly! influence. absolutely none of it is for equality. its for favoritism  and manipulation.
@raggmopp 3377  I will also admit that this is based off the previews seen on vhs releases where they talk about how the movies are coming out of the vault for a limited time so they can be put onto dvd or something.
haha yes.. or usually it means.. .   updated for woke audiences!
very very true
I d prefer to call it  updated to manipulate modern audiences.
@malarkey williamsbury iv  is it base on animaniacs
@casstastrophe  tifa looks the exact same what the crap are you on about. they barely changed her. lola bunny it was odd they made her kind of sexual in the first place. its a fucking anthromorphic rabbit who wants to defend the sexual assets of that  and I prefer lola from looney tunes the show the dumb one but endearing anyways. and I think the new space jam had bigger issues than lola.
@casstastrophe  and lara does not look like abby that much. and honestly people made too much of a deal about abby anyways its a double edged sword if your gonna try and defend over sexualized and feminine bodies and how they are normal and not unrealistic than also accept that abby s body type is possible and real women have looked like that. whether its possible in the apocalypse is whatever but than again joel is also the same body type as he was in 2013. and its also fiction.
@chandler burse  I never said stocky or muscular women weren t natural. people have all different body types  and thats cool. diversity is great  and thats what makes humans humans. original characters  fine. luisa from encanto  love her. zarya from ow  I think she s got a really cool design. but when youre taking popular feminine icons and just making them more masculine because thats the  norm  these days  thats when we need to take a step back and look at things. and yes  its a work of fiction  but isn t representation in works of fiction the point we re all wrapped up in
@casstastrophe  I really dont see making a woman more fit as masculine. its odd people see women who have muscle and are more athletic as man-like. I guess maybe your not saying that but people do. Ive seen dudes complain that aloy from horizon zero dawn has peach fuzz so it means shes more man-like but all it really meant is they have never seen a woman up close.
@casstastrophe  but is your argument for more representation for big breasted women  then its also valid for people to want more small breasted women too. I see this topic as a odd one Ive met entire groups of men who say women with small breasts are ugly or if your attracted to flat chested women your a pedo. and Ive seen women say they met girls who slut shamed them for having big breasts. I just think its odd to hate redesigning a character to be either or. when both can and do exist and are fine in their own ways.
@chandler burse  all Im saying is that they should just let the characters that do have bigger breasts  or a rounder butt  the whole tracer debacle from back in the day   or whatever else the woke crowd deems  lewd  or  unrealistic  simply exist as they are. I would say the same thing if it was the other way around  if for instance  they did take a character like zarya and decide to tone down her musculature or suddenly she appears with giant knockers. not every body fits a certain standard  and thats perfectly okay. but dont try to erase those body types for woke points. updated graphics  cool. complete redesign  not cool.
@casstastrophe  Ive just seen worse redesigns in my opinion. ones that dont even look recognizable to some extent and more than they removed a breast size or whatever. there s still plenty of curvy and busty characters out there anyways. I just am exhausted the whininess of the gaming fandom. its just can be as toxic as  woke  culture or whatever is.
@casstastrophe  also its funny melonie said james  face is mostly the same in the sh2 remake when people in the fandom are clearly having many issues with how he looks since he isn t modeled after guy chihI anymore.
@chandler burse  I didn t actually know that he was modeled after guy chihI  and I was wondering why they changed him so drastically. sh2 is one of my favorite games  but I think they made james look too cartoony. there s a weird uncanniess to his face now  at least for me.
@casstastrophe  its not really easy to just update an old outdated design from ps1 and ps2 to the realistic graphics today.
@casstastrophe  I dont see how he looks cartoony. he looks like a real person.
@casstastrophe  guy chihI had a huge blowout with konamI before anyways I doubt they were gonna get him to return for anything even the modeling. quite frankly the fandom has a lot of people going mad to the point where they are nitpicking the trailer and arguing their head canon interpretations with one of the devs on twitter  wonderful
@casstastrophe  I just want to see how it turns out Ive never played the sh games and have no real way of doing so for me. I like to experience them. but my God I am so sick of the gaming fandom sometimes and I have a bad habit of engaging with it because I am a stupid person. people cant accept when others like what they dont and hate what they love.
@chandler burse  Imean yeah  she still look fine as hell  but they did still massively nerf her knockers.
@aamer kastoff  I never said they dont exist I never said they aren t unrealistic I just said what Ive heard and known about tomb raider maybe its just a myth. I honestly do not think lara s old design even beyond her breasts would look good in a modern engine she was made to be cartoony in her old design clearly like a lot of game characters did.
@aamer kastoff  chill out.
@aamer kastoff  didn t the original reboot include costumes based on her old design and even a old ps1 render of her as a skin  is this the reboot people are talking about if so I hardly find that as trying to erase what she looked like before and trying to say she was sexist designed. and I never said busty women are bad as a straight man thats hard to say. good Lord maybe I said it wrong but I didn t mean that look at lara s original design especially her cgI scenes she cannot possibly resemble that easily in a modern game engine I would think.
@chandler burse  bruh  all I said was is they nerfed her teets  just pointing that out there. doesnt make me any less attracted to them or any less attractive.but I guess all Im really saying is that it is unnecessary and no one wanted it  except of course the twitteratI culture weirdos  who are a small minority but somehow are able to influence corporate decisions in videogames  which is lame.
@commander vile  I really dont get why they would want it anyways. but to be fair I dont really know if its done for politics or not unless something says so. kind of tired of video comment sections like this just assuming everything is done in spite of their beliefs it just feels like thats the case sometimes. same way for leftists.
@chandler burse  take a look at every tomb raider game and their evolution. in all lara is hot and curvy. they purposely are making her more plain  thick  and flat chested because of the outrage mob.
@chandler burse  is this your first day on the internet or do you think only you get to voice your views   rhetorical question
@aamer kastoff  when did I act like only my views can be expressed  and what does every entry she is curvy have to do with my points  dude I dont get what your trying to say and I dont think Imentioned any of this.
@aamer kastoff  I am just saying why your going off on multiple topics I had nothing to say about. let alone you got my point wrong I feel.
@chandler burse  Im doing quick replies and just now looked at the thread. you are posting a lot  like abnormally a lot. are you lonely
flat is justice! but on the other hand... more to grab  more to love.
@aamer kastoff  I am just very interested and have a lot of things that make me attentive to this stuff. sorry if I offended you I guess but today hasn t been well right now thats for sure.
my favorite niece was an early bloomer  and by the time she was 14 she was filling a d-cup.it was hard for her to interact with others and we constantly told her there was nothing wrong with her  for obvious reasons this didn t help much when sorrounded by hormonal envious teenagers.I wish I could have done more to help her.
@agonizing turtle  I was a c cup by 14  and I was a super big tomboy  so I wore lots of baggy clothes to try to hide my figure. pretty much everyone in my grade teased me and gave me a hard time about it. its really a damned if you do  damned if you dont situation.
@fotis3v  six packs maybe  but I dont know if size really matters to most women. being hot is enough once they are there they kind of deal with the other stuff dont they
@fotis3v  statistically and in questionaire wise women say otherwise but it really depends on the person. and how they are going about it.
@fotis3v  admittedly one time partners are said to prefer bigger sizes  but for long term they are fine with smaller sizes. it probably depends on the situation and wants and desires. and to be fair I think men have similar statistics for attributes of women they want to be with one time.
@casstastrophe  are you blind or something
@james sunderwater  no. are you
@woffydoggy  there are worse words  like   plastic   or   false   among other things  but yeah  the world has gone full circle now  its incredibly stupid
@casstastrophe  that one is a beast  not a woman  lol
they want everyone to become an androgynous nullo
you know who to blame right   modern feminists .
@chandler burse  the problem is abby looking so muscular in a zombie apocalypse!
@spartan revenant  joel is also in the same shape he was in his 30s in the zombie apocalypse. its also fiction. I feel this comeback was just established when people realize that indeed women do look like abby hell there are women who look bigger and weirder than she does. but people poke fun at her body because they think tlou2 is the wokest game ever when its not even close.
@spartan revenant  Imean other zombie games have shown little change to character s looks after the apocalypse before. deacon st john looks the exact same in days gone after two years into the freaker apocalypse. why complain now  just because its abby and thats the issue. there are bigger things to criticize tlou2 for than her design.
@jamesmaybrick2001  exactly where the fuck did that come from
programming
jep every straight guy that doesnt feel constant shame about their sexuality is consider a coomer nowadays. fun times. can only get worse. I have no idea what the end goal is  but the agenda couldn t be more obvious
its because wokie new gen derr-less zombies  feel better. if they repress attractive people.  aka frusk from g4
@robint h-d.e.s   oh nooooes  not the mom pants too Im so tired of them. the kids are bringing back our style from highschool in the early 00s though.
@david t  haha same here.  and cool pic.  clint is a legend. Ive seen all his westerns
@robint h-d.e.s  he s legen-  wait for it. I hope youre not lactose intolerant.  -dary.
@robint h-d.e.s  it was a silly line from how Imet your mother that was repeated so much it became a meme. the santa claus is just for the helluvit
@robint h-d.e.s  a fistful of dollars...  my mistake. four coffins.
@robint h-d.e.s  yeah I just watched jeremy s hot take on aoc s recent meltdown for having to read all the plebs  tweets since verification is cheap now. his channel is thequartering. he has the washington politics and melonie mac here has the boom boom on entertainment politics lol
@david t  cool shout out. I know that channel. I heard about him threw review china  usa. maybe check out. its a gundam. he does some funny meme on them content. lots of duck sounds though  hah
@ebe  right. and I can draw what most these devs look like  with crayons
@melonie mac go boom   5 35  Imiss back when lara just raided tombs and  master cheaks  was just a genetically augmented super soldier.
every media influences audiences and is ideological  you were just blind to it when the right was doing it
@michal andrej moln r thats not how that works. Im centrist....the left is the crazier of the two however.
@lemur theory  in what way is it crazier
@michal andrej moln r your talking about the left on the nazI talk for sure and that angle is ignoring stages of pregnancy and the question of at what point the baby has right to live.the right was actually punching nazis while the left was  peace and love  hippies protesting to end that war which would have meant letting the nazis have their way.
@lemur theory  what  I dont know what youre talking about. when was the right punching nazis
@lemur theory  was the right to an abortion taken away  yes. do they want to take away more rights like to contraception and gay marriage  yes they do.
@michal andrej moln r at what point does the baby have right to life  everyone s fine with contraception  and no one cares one way or the other about gay marriage.
@michal andrej moln r love how you deleted a whole argument point as I was responding by the way. people take notice to thatsort of thing now dont act like you didn t type it.
@lemur theory  what  I didn t delete anything.
@lemur theory  I care about gay marriage and a lot of people do. the point is the right wants to take away people s rights.
@michal andrej moln r  and thats just simply not true and a pretty bad fallacies for you to work off of.
@michal andrej moln r   ...when the  what  was doing it   does  t that exact kind of vernacular imply a very heavily indoctrinated ideology  and aren t you also implying that the very concept of an ideology of any kind existing is inherently immortal while also having and using one
@beregond  ideology is everywhere and every political party has its own  ideology is not immoral.
@lu bu just persuading to make a sale and get the game in the first place is not the same thing as trying to change the way people think about a subject from with in the game. sometimes even when women try to design women they tend to do the same thing as original lara.besides mudding up the meaning of influence doesnt negate what Im saying.
@lu bu  false equivalence... not how that works mr. ad hominem.messaging over a subject within game is not the same as getting people to buy the game in the first place.
@lemur theory  what messaging
@lu bu so tell me. do you watch the videos and read previous comments
@lemur theory  Ive only watched this cringe video and read your cringe comments
@lu bu if so then you know what messages. trying to argue through fallacies is a waste of time.speaking of  if its so cringe why are you taking the time to still respond then
@lemur theory  there was no fallacy of my part but yeah. because its so dumb that it merits some answer.
@lu bu huh irony.
@spartan revenant  no he didn t  that is a complete myth. manny doesnt even look like neil and he doesnt have sex with abby owen does who isn t the one who people thought neil inserted in the game. manny was modeled and mocapped by another person. why are people still pushing this complete bullcrap  this is why I came in expecting a far worse game and I got something that wasn t that bad.
@spartan revenant  manny doesnt even look like neil aside from the manbun. and neil isn t hispanic anyways either. and why do people think manny was the one who had sex with abby  it was the redheaded dude. did you play the game
@chandler burse  so big boobs are dated now ... her appearance was part of the essense of the game. Imena if that is the case... super mario is waaay more dated... loose the mustage and overalls. see what Imean
same here sister  same!
@chandler burse  thats not the point. everyone is going on about representation. but everything busty is being eliminated. where is my busty representation  Im a busty woman and I dont see myself represented. instead Im told that I am unrealistic and unreal with my body type.
@chandler burse  that is not the point. we busty women are being told that we shouldn t exist! that is the point!
@moopis boopis  you people complain about everyone wanting representation but then wanting it yourselves unironically is a bit well hypocritical isn t it I get some people do use that as an argument but they do ironically never seriously like Imean white men are not in some shows today and I could make the point  well where is my representation   but its not serious its a joke on the fact forced representation without any substance is dumb.
@moopis boopis  I really dont think you are being told that just because lara doesnt have the knockers that use to make teenage boys pause their game back in the day. you know Ive seen a lack of horses in many open world games  sure botw and rdr have them. but gta and other games set in modern day dont. where is their representation  huh huh huh huh. okay I am being a bit too cynical but I honestly am just trying to vent a bit I guess.
@moopis boopis  lady dimitrescu was pretty busty did you miss her entry in the gaming world  or mother miranda I think too she was well endrowed. and ivy valentine still exists  samus isn t too small chested either... cmon its just like the argument that there is a lack of strong independent female characters I could just go look them up and find plenty.as for older ones you guys still have the boss probably the greatest female character Ive ever seen in gaming  although if anyone played mgs3 and gave a crap about how her rack looked then they didn t deserve to play that game
@chandler burse  regarding her original design of her and also other characters that where created in the 90s you also need to keep in mind the technical limitations  polygon count . in order to make a character look female in the game engine you almost had to exaggerate the proportions. same pretty much goes for muscular men. it is just that they did stick with it in higher resolution marketing and and follow up titles.for me  tomb raider was always about the adventuring  the climbing and jumping  finding secrets and solving environmental riddles. I liked the fact that it featured a cool female character. but her actual body type was never an issue for me. but this also includes the new model  I am quite okay with it. but that is probably because her proportions where never the iconic feature of that character for me personally.in general I think it is okay to use realistic proportions in the current age  but if the original character was iconic for a certain body type  you should at least for the realistic version of that body type and not completely change it. or  keep it exaggerated in a way that absolutely fits the game design  -  have many exaggerated and unrealistic things .
we live in a super petty society now  where people who have not  think they are entitled to drag everyone else down to their level of misery and malcontentedness. its pathetic. its time for us  normies  to stop allowing this and actively support a return to normalcy again. I wont give these fools a nickel of my money anymore. if I buy their games  its going to be during a 90  reduction sale or from the discount bin at my local game store. I ll never pay full price again for any of it and really  I only care about around 2  of what they ve made in the last 10 years  so no problem there!
@arrow333  Imean that is well and fine except for the fact quite a few female characters existed on the ps1 and they didn t have huge knockers like hers. Imean after all claire and jill existed and were easily identifiable as female.
@woffydoggy  what kind of country is that
exactly. women with big boobs exist too!
@aamer kastoff
@chandler burse  tbf  dimitrescu and miranda are not player characters. plus evil villains. ivy valentine is one character in fighting games. samus is in her suit most of the time  plus often being fps. I cant really think of many big boobed third person player characters  apart from those bikinI sports games  lol . most of the time big boobs are made to be features on thirst trap npcs. not a lot of main hero player characters with big boobs.
@marcus  miles morales is under a mask most of the time but people dont say that when people praise him for being diverse.
@moopis boopis  if I insulted you personally I apologize. but I never meant to do so. I was just making a comparison or whatever at how people demanding diversity on both sides can have the same issues. and redesigns aren t necessarily bad  especially when its a reboot. and quite frankly lara s face  and body doesnt seem like something I could imagine being brought into the hd world easily from the ps2. she s very cartoony and that was the intention probably its same level as trying to make crash bandicoot super realistic. they either need to change the style or something else. and people s only point here isn t her breasts necessarily  people are saying she looks like a man now  I dont see how people said aloy looks like a man because they didn t understand peace fuzz exists  and so on. people say this is an attempt to make them less attractive well it isn t working. lara in all forms is pretty attractive  same for jill and claire and whatever other character has been redesigned to have less appeal. and its not just me  despite the fact I find almost every woman attractive nearly.
@kitcat  I dont think jealously is always the reason. if there is a woke reason its due to stupid radicality that believes we need less feminized women to associate with transgenders and tomboys and to be fair there s nothing wrong with tomboys or flat chested women. but changing an old character doesnt help although lara is still anything but flat. she just isn t massive anymore.
@marcus  do they need to be playable to be diverse  I feel its a bit of a cop out  its the same issue with super woke people who demand there be more black people even if they aren t even black themselves and when a movie has plenty of strong supporting black characters they still bring up the fact the main character isn t black so they still hate it. like it just goes down that route.
@moopis boopis  I think Imeant conservatives with  you people  or just the comment thread in general.I cant believe people are reading my comments and interpret it as  he hates big breasted women  I am a straight man  with a lot of problems and sexual desire is always one for many of us. so why would I hate a trait of women that is quite attractive
@aamer kastoff  this makes me think of this little comic meme thing I saw once. itshows an attractive woman getting up at the crack of dawn to go for a run and then she cooks her own breakfast and walks to work  etc  and then at the end itshows two snobby looking women gossiping around her pretty much saying   must be nice to be effortlessly thin and not have to try.
@casstastrophe  I heard they also did it with morrigan from dragon age  but I am not sure.
@casstastrophe  bro tifa is still stacked lol
Im not entrenched in womens  discourse  but is this common  for instance  I see instagram  onlyfans  reddit  and the music industry and there is no shortage of thicc women. in fact  itseems like the modern beauty standard favors these features. Imean  what s with the rat race for the lip injections  butt injections  and boob jobs to meet this standard if thats not the case
@casstastrophe   well  I was referring more to the beauty standard than a societal role but thats interesting  too. its interesting because there are different factions of feminism  I suppose  with different views on these topics. in terms of commodifying beauty  such as with instagram models or sensual twitch streamers  as much as its demonized as internalized misogyny  I see many proponents champion it as female empowerment. so not really sure how to bridge the gap here  maybe cast alexandra doddario as lara croft in the re-reboot lol
yeah I dont see why its bad to have a rack  in fact I think thats female empowerment right there I think thats something that women should be proud of you know you take what you get and if youre blessed youre blessed.but because one or two or three or four women are upset about how people look at them because of their breast size now we cant have women with big breasts and any woman who has big breasts should be ousted from society.this nonsense needs to stop
its refreshing to finally hear a take like this  thank you!
and Im really sorry to hear that you go through that and feel that way. it really sucks that all of this censorship stuff really comes down to insecurity on the censorers end. people really need to learn not to think less of themselves just because some people have favorable features that they dont. its such an immature way of thinking and based of what you said it can be harmful.
two words  rhona mitra
its not just the breasts. the model doesnt feel like they even tried to make lara croft. like  let s change the character altogether. geeze
@nicco salonga   its not just the breasts. the model doesnt feel like they even tried to make lara croft. like  let s change the character altogether. geeze they are all going for the abby look.abby is the new normal for women.abby-normal    p
@freedomofspeech24  she looks like if lara was 45.
@chandler burse thats not at all what a self insert means. Im a black guy and its generally hard to find art that would accurately depict how I look on pinterest  but I can still give life to a character Imake and give them my ideals  motivations  fears while using a white character. whole reason of a self insert is just to simply create a character that you can see yourself in.although I haven t heard about thatstory though  thatshitsounds wild. but the way you explain a self insert is just incorrect.
@kidlemon  I dont even know what comment I said this in and I am not going to find it lol.I just know people here are being a bit dramatic.
@chandler burse  yt comment section moment
@kidlemon  yt comment section moment.
yep meanwhile as a man I could buy a mega sized bust and wear it and you as the busty woman will have to acknowledge me. its all backwards. pride was the downfall of man.
@wookieninja87  quite frankly sir.... what.
@chandler burse  quite frankly what I said. if you cant understand my comment then you cant understand my explanation so Im not going to waste mine or your time since I see how busy you are here.
@wookieninja87  I dont know who understood your comment. do you mean if you have breasts  at the same time  I dont get why your comment feels like an insult to op  like what  also for explanation a bust in the context you said sounds more like a bust of your head a statue mold.
@wookieninja87  yeah that logic makes perfect sense dude totally 100  why even have teachers then  if the student cant understand the assignment then they wont understand the explanation. teachers should just throw the paper at the kids and then tell them to shut the hell up and do it. some of the worst logic Ive ever heard lol.
@chandler burse  you aren t a student and Im not a teacher. both of your replies shows how little thinking you do and solidifies my  not wasting yours or mine s time . now go bother some one else they may actually want your attention.
@wookieninja87  this isn t even your comment why even end with the  go bother someone else  that crap is old and weird lol. my point still stands just because we aren t student and teacher I am basically saying why even make the statement at all if you aren t willing to back it up or argue for it  and part of that is explaining but whatever.
as a black man
same thing I am a tall guy with a wide frame. my body type is deemed toxic by default when it comes to modern games.
@max v.  Im sorry what games demonize your body shape  if youre saying what I think you are. then kratos is literally a representation of your body dude lol. joel too. probably nathan although he isn t that wide.
@chandler burse  not games  society and wokeness is trying to get rid of it in games and media.  I love kratos!
@aamer kastoff  I get that this is a mostly leftist issue but leftism is not greedy or jealous at its core  the point is to diversify and encourage safety for all  it is literally about sharing and building each other up. the problem is thatsome leftists take those ideals in an incredibly toxic and damaging direction  but that can be said for any political direction and there are examples of modern issues caused by members of every major movement
@aamer kastoff  if thats where we re taking this let s talk about how most of europe adheres to significantly more leftist ideals than countries like america  and are able to retain higher wealth per citizen  lower crime rates  death rates  better education  better law enforcement  better prison records with lower repeat offenders  in just about every statistic advanced leftist countries rain supreme.there is no historically proven good or bad political ideology  no good or evil in politics  its not that black and white. to think its as simple as some beliefs being somehow better or more functional than others on a fundamental level is to misunderstand politics entirely.like I said there are bad leaders in every group  bad influences around every corner  but with the wrong or right tools anything can be a force of good and bad. for example let s focus on video game representation  is it good that curvy characters are needlessly erased for being attractive  no  thats bad. is it good to introduce diverse body types to new characters where it best serves their story and personality like we see with for example thor in gow  yes  thats a fantastic example of representation done right.there are good lessons to be learned from everyone and everything
@aamer kastoff  I live happily in norway and have for most of my life  even outside the major citys I know our crime rates are low  I know you barely ever see anyone sleeping without a home  or selling their bodies to survive  I know the state genuinely supports me and my people when we need them  that my workplace is safe and stable  thatschool shootings are so rare we dont even train for them or mention them to our students all their lives.I also know that I have free healthcare if my life is in danger  that our criminals are mostly petty thieves and young  immature men just trying to prove themselves  I know that by every metric from happiness to wealth we outclass america and can prove it from my own experience. my house is just fine  my education and job are more than sufficient  my physical and mental health is well above average  and last time I went to america I was honestly disappointed by everything I saw
@tyconewrc  Im talking about video games  my dude  not real people.
then you have to help teach male media-producers how to convince female wannabe-actors  to be interested in going through all-natural procedures in order to gain  thiccer  curves.  how should a male producer director explain his personal preference for curvy female characters  in a way that actresses should respect the man for his preference
@desox  its not salty old people making the changes its leftist millennial activists.
@michal andrej moln r  big boobs is about lose a term as it can be. is it a d  dd  e  f or g cup  or even bigger. and with those old style chunky graphics  compared to the smooth lines of todays female game characters  this is a debate that will split the waters.
I agree  they should leave things be  Imean for God s sake they re just video game characters  they re not real people
@chandler burse  youre a man literally lecturing a woman on how she should feel about female character design trends. stop bruh lmao
@chandler burse  abby exists so that they could put a sex scene in a game that looks like two dudes going at it without putting in two dudes going at it lol
@mike rosoft  I am of the people who dont really see abby as that man like beyond her muscles her face and everything is still very feminine her face model afterall is not a muscular body builder anyways. and I think people who say she looks like a man are again hating the game for the pettiest of reasons. rather than actual issues. and I wouldn t doubt many of them also like exaggerated anime girls with giant knockers that look more painful than actually sexy. I just think creators can design characters however they want whether or not their reasons for doing so are stupid is a different thing.
@chandler burse  abby s shoulders and arms are bigger than what most guys have lol. and in standard druckman fashion  flat chest. druckman has continually said that he s trying to desexualize women. the issue is that regular women dont look like that.
@mike rosoft  maybe he is thats his problem but in general I dont really hate abby nor her design since I think creators should be allowed to do whatever. neils reasoning is the issue not what he made. thats why I dont care that angrboda is black in gowr its fine and its not even forcing a message at all despite what whiny people claim. regular men also dont look like street fighter characters either. unless they are younger arnold s on steroids of course lol.anime also shows women who look extremely young and have giant boobs but no one cares then. characters have always appeared as exaggerated from time to time.
@mike rosoft  not to mention percy jackson had ares daughter who is about as big as abby is in the actual books.
@mike rosoft  it didn t really work since there will always be sexualizing of characters supposedly jill remake was done for less sexualization yet there s so much people ogling her. and not to mention rule 34 will always exist of these characters lol. its the eye of the beholder not really what the designer does at this point both unfortunately and fortunately maybe fortunately I dont know lol.
@freedomofspeech24
@lu bu  no Im deaf.
dont most female game chapters have huge tits  most women dont have huge video game tits and a perfect hourglass figure. if they started making tall 6 4 video game male characters average height in reboots  would that be  erasing  or oppressing tall men  its not a big deal. tall muscular men and hot big breasted women aren t oppressed lol. its reasonable for people to want more representation centered around what is  average . y all trying too hard to be victims lol.
@seri  exactly
