I love that being a minority is so important to luigisamo that he even ignores his real partial italian roots to whine that an italian character is positioned as italian and not some kind of minority.
how dare a white actor play an italian plumber. we re beyond clown world at this point. also happy birthday melonie!!!
did john forget mario in the og movie was played by a bob hopkins  a british man that had to pull of a very thick brooklyn accent  which was very impressive for him to do  Im so confused. and yes  I get that lou albino was italian american  but he didn t do an italian accent. he did a brooklyn accent.
I think we re all forgetting how leguizamo s talent helped make the original such a box office hit.oh wait...
happy birthday melonie  have a great one! also  this reminds me of leguizamo when he praised the  colour blind casting  of the mario movie  which saw him  a columbian  play an italian  only for him to then criticise james franco  a white man  playing fidel castro. the mental mathematics  a polite word for hypocrisy  is astonishing. they re on some good will hunting shit if they are even able to understand themselves and their infinite contradictions.lmao  just watched the video and he s at it again.
oh my gosh Im so glad someone covered this article!! I read it out loud to my friend and pointed out everything wrong with it on the bus!  I find myself ranting about movies to my friends and that was my soapbox of the day  anyways  another thing I d like to point out is that this guy who played luigI says people think he s the classic and all that and how people will enjoy the  ethnically diverse and well thought out 1993 movie more  when it had a rotten tomato score of 26  and nobody knew who this guy was until now
I dont want no crackers in my soup!   lmao   I am so using thatsomeday. happy birthday melonie
there s no reason why super mario bros. has to be a crazy expensive hollywood action franchise.
man  leguizamo is talking mad sh t for someone who doesnt have john wick s car fixed also  happy birthday  melonie!
really was hoping for a 100  italian cast...also delivered in italian with no subtitles. oscar worthy.
happy birthday melonie ! thanks for covering this hilarious news ! if chris pratt  a big name that people would come to see  can pull off the mario voice and accent  then let it be! its called voice acting! pretty sure japanese dont complain when people of other races voice japanese people in anime! white  black  italian  spanish  russian  chinese  korean people voicing japanese people so people in there countries can enjoy anime without reading subtitles. in voice acting  if you can pull off the voice and have the talent  you got the part! its not restricted by your skin color or culture because people dont see that in voice acting! if it was live action  then yeah  have italians play mario and luigI  but its not!
john leguizamo was a fun loving stand-up comedian that wasn t afraid to make offensive jokes and dress up as stereotypical characters in his comedy. I went to go watch thatsuper mario bros movie in theater. neither one of the mario brothers were itailian and leguizamo didn t even bother to grow a mustache for luigi. yet we watched it and it was weird....but fine. I had some nitpicks about the movie even in elementary school. does he seriously think some of us dont remember his show  house of buggin   simply because it lasted one season on fox back in the mid 90s  he thinks we forgot about  the pest   his comedy was stupid comedy. class clown comedy. so over the top and ridiculous you just had to laugh at it. he was very good at it. probably the best. that was his peak. then  he got serious in acting. thats when he fell off. now he s playing small parts in movies. which is fine  but thats clearly not the best he has to offer. he s confined now. its not even an age or maturity thing. he cant make jokes he would ve made in the 1990s or he knows he ll lose everything. comedy was a place where talented people could say or do anything  just as long as it made the audience laugh. to make lite of heavy things. thats a sorely needed vent we need in society thats been closed off by the no joke woke who cater to narcissist. its really a shame to see it happen. happy birthday  mac boom boom!
Im more offended by him not having an italian accent lol
so many people in tv movies are just obsessed with race. and this is an animated movie!!! I dont care what the voice actor looks like  I just want to be entertained. kinda like how melonie struggling to pronounce things is always entertaining
hold on everyone. I think melonie is trying to tell us something with that opening bit  but I cant quite put my finger on it.....happy birthday!
a year older and still stunning  happy birthday melonie.
I think I cracked up with every new pronunciation of  le- gooey-zamo  happy birthday melonie!
happy not quite thanksgiving birthday  fellow end of year born person! its sad how all these people care more about the color of the ink  than the words that are written. using a nicer color wont make bad writing good. but they always act like it does. though  in this case  itsounds like leguizamo is really just jealous that he didn t get cast in the movie. and since he doesnt have any good reason to complain  he made it about race  since that guarantees he ll get attention.
happy birthday melonie  I hope you and your family have an amazing day. thank you for giving us content even on your day!
happy birthday melonie! youre doing a great job!  keep it up and God bless!
yeah mario has always been white what the heck people stop!! this now!!!!
@zack roy  lol I knew I d see this comment after saying this to myself after reading just the title
john leguizamo apparently doesnt realize he is not transgender enough to make comments about casting in 2022
Jesus loves you
he s not even part italian. he claimed to be part italian part puerto rican but he s neither of those. he s mostly colombian and spanish with a little bit of africanthrown in there somewhere. he s not italian at all.
is he agreeing with a certain ww2 leader that italians aren t white
wasn t he a gay transvestite in one of his roles  oh  wait.  he s ok for that role.
@Christian skeleton  this I know.  fore!the Bible tells me so.hey! a hole in one!
italians are white. they are label caucasian  just like spanish  french  portuguese and most europeans
@richard b  but chris isn t
@joshentertainment 2  damn and jack black aint a koopa either
@sweetroll dealer  keegan michael key isn t a mushroom person either.
@richard b  yeah  I never understand the perception in the u.s.
@richard b  caucasian does not equal white  its mediterranean  for what thats worth
damn sure luigI was italian and not a latino with a speech impediment.
@mrbisshie  roosevelt
italian doesnt mean white italians aren t white Im creole french and cantell you through history that not everyone had a white pale complexion
@zack roy  mario shouldn t be black but mario isn t just some white guy he always had some sort of undertones and she literally just fighting saying no black lead roles and that people are just against white peoples bc y all want to be considered minority
@ramix nudles  also a deranged clown. his best performance.
@mrbisshie  Imean  you can just say his name. he s not fucking voldemort lol
@billy bob  yeah thats true but when u take any official form they always ask whether u r white caucasian  native american  pacific islander or asian but Ive never seen mediterranean  I guess its just an americanthing  makes me wonder what officials forms in europe say  or in the rest of the southern american continent
@austin koeppen
@richard b  fun example  elon musk is an african american  would you call him black
we need dave chappell in white face playing a japanese caricature of blue-collar italians!!! so diverse  and diversity is our strength!!!
based on the trailer I dont like the actor ..I dont feel any energy from him..but yeah if he sound good with italian accent why not
@richard b all europeans are european. europe isn t a country. its a bunch of indigenous peoples.
@richard b the word youre looking for is european. europe isn t a country.
@billy bob  musk is not african. africa isn t a country. musk is an european-american immigrant.
@billy bob  european and white are synonymous.
@dalia  rpa is in africa as long as I remember
@the bicz  maps are hard  lol
@dalia  so let me see if I got your argument straight  because its rather convoluted.all europeans are european  but not all africans are african  genius...
um aren t italians white
@liquid  depending on who you ask  even arabs can be considered white. but italians  spainiards  and portuguese just aren t white white  like northern european white
@joshentertainment 2  so  italians are white and chris is white and who cares  he jusy voices mario.
@billy bob  mario s game voice actor is a white dude making a stereotypical italian accent. also mario s original accent was a scruffy brooklyn accent like danny devito  the fake italian accent came later to appeal to kids thats why its so high pitched  not tolerable for a movie
@asana  yeah. I dont get how people aren t considered  white  but yet have white skin! like if they aren t white but have white skin  what are we supposed to call them  if you say by their nationality  then why do we call americans white instead of american  unless they re in a different country of course but Im referring to anyone in their own respective country . its just dumb to me. and I figured it be good to say so here since you seem to have similar ideas like mine.ok bye
@revan 1313  exactly. he s just doing his job
@silas hurd  americans have very miniscule understanding of the outside world. americans when they find thatspainish is a european language instead of latin american langauge
@asana  yeah pretty much. thats society nowadays. hope you have a good rest of your day
Im half italian and people think Im mexican lmao but yes I consider myself white
@asana  I have friends who are half italian and look white as can be but Im half italian and look  mixed  like I could pass for about anything but I have white skin still so I consider myself white
brits are excellent at accents overall.
everyone needs a piece of the victim pie if they can get it lmao  john doesnt know that european countries pretty much dont count though
yes  I was confused too. but after trying to decipher his ravings I think he was mad that neither character was nonwhite. he s mad luigI is white  because surely everyone should have remembered the iconic performance of the great hispanic actor john leguizamo and thus only think of a hispanic for the role!  but he s also mad about mario since he wouldn t mind the actual lead being hispanic either.
@gambit771  yeah  I remember watching the mario and roger rabbit movies as a kid and then later in life learning that bob hoskins was british and not american. it blew my mind  he was pretty convincing at the time. although nowadays I can sort of hear his real accent come out in a couple lines of dialogue. still  he was a great actor.
john linguinI is partly white european with a white first name and white last name who speaks english and spanish  two white languages.
notice he waited until bob hoskins was dead to pull this shit...
@marychocolatefairy  since when is luigI a hispanic name  anyway  my uncle luigI would be surprised.
I didn t even know bob hoskins was british until recently. he put of a new york accent in the mario movie and roger rabbit
they forget there s a japanese voice cast that doesnt sound italian.
@foursidekm  in the recent trailer  chris is doing a brooklyn accent. not the best one  but itsounds okay. still not gonna make me sob and moan about it. I dont care about  the beef people have with pratt  just want to see my second favorite video game franchise get a great movie adaptation  and no emotional damaged babies on social media are gonna take that away from me.
xd
well said
well  he s really italian on his father s side. in fact  there is nothing really latino about him at all  as his mother is of lebanese descent. he only considers himself hispanic because his parents are from puerto rico and colombia.
at the same time  I dont see any problems with franco. castro was spanish and franco was portuguese by father. not the same  but much closer than italians and hispanics.
the funny thing is that this is an animated film where the voice matters and not the heritage of the person. Im not sure why john is seeking attention for. is he not getting any more roles
@nemesis the slasher    recently  one of the popular animr va turned down the role of a part-mexican character in the english dub sequel because  he doesnt have any mexican experience . but at the same time  he continued to play japanese characters in games and even admitted that he did not find anything hypocritical in this. these people are just trying to increase reputation points.
@andrewfantome  they do all that whilst looking foolish. the actor who played apu did similar after backlash yet simpsons stereotypes the english  germans etc. they bow down to people that might not even watch their stuff in the first place. they seem to want to alienate their audience for a few on twitter. shows like simpsons mock the overly religious like flanders for wanting shows removed yet bow down to the other lot who want stuff removed because they claim to be offended.
@nemesis the slasher   oh  this is an old thing. south park finally defeated the simpsons precisely because parker and stone weren t afraid to directly compare activists on the left with those on the right  at least in the past. if I remember correctly  this has nothing to do with black actors who voice whites in mainstream shows.
@andrewfantome  leguizamo is very hispanic and more hispanic than yourealize. first off the surname  leguizamo  is basque which is quite important because most colombians are actually of both french and spaniard ancestry. in fact leguizamo recently confirmed everything I said on a recent episode of find your roots.
so basically  franco just isn t hispanic enough  for leguizamo.  I love these hollywood purity tests.
leguizamo s been irrelevant since the 90 s. he can stay there for all I care.
he was clown in the spawn movie. he was also actor in romero s land of the dead. he really never mattered.
@norman readdis  dont hate on birthday vibes man lol
its all about the money I guess.
there s no reason any franchise has to be a crazy expensive action franchise. mario is popular. lots of kids and adults with nostalgia will want to see it. I think its a smart business move  lots of cross promotion for the games and vice versa .
@brandon rogers  every big budget film is all about the money
@onechill braj  but its suddenly bad when the ip is tomb raider.
happy birthday
japanese stuff are different
@backup368  no. tomb raider could make a fine big budget film. they just happened to make a shit one.
he was pretty damn good as clown in spawn. Imean I guess that it isn t serious  but it isn t low brow comedy either. he was also pretty good in summer of sam.
victim status is like royalty for these people.
@danny adam  dunno why you deleted your comment but if it triggers you so much maybe it applies more than you think comrade
@danny adam  stay salty comrade  Im sorry the education system has failed you so very entirely.
I dont get it either. kratos is white  greek  and voiced by black americans. samuraI jack is japanese and voiced by a black man. I dont get why hollywood wants the voice actors ethnicity to match
its kind of funny how they care about so much about having a voice actor that matches the character they play even though they wont be seen  but dont care about the same thing when it comes to live action movies or tv shows where it actually does kind of matter.
happy birthday melonie! I learned sometime ago that there s a big difference between liberal and left. true liberals passionately love the bill of rights and individual freedom. leftists hate all of that with an extreme passion. just say  freedom of speech  and the leftists will go loco. I love what david rubin said about progressives. he said that  progressives aren t progressive at all. everything they believe in is regressive to the core.  or something like that.
did you know that the original voice of mario is also in the movie  I wonder who is he voicing
these people are being silly. and complaining over the dumbest things.  that was funny you throwing your hat away. I love that you add  hecked up.  Im glad you do use cuss word. your the best melonie. Im looking forward to the movie.again happy birthday. have a wonderful day melonie.
laughing my hecking butt off throughout the whole vid. you were super funny in this video. you always know how to make me laugh. you are hilarious! you are a riot! I love ya my goofy goober friendo.
Im the only one who knows how to make this movie work script wise!   quick  someone remind me of leguizamo s award-winning writing credits.
I love how your pronounciation of his name just gets gradually more emphatic as the video progresses.
happy birthday melonie  and I personally cant wait to see this movie  not in the cinema but you know where-ever it comes out. also I cant wait for the meme s that this movie will spawn. the studio movies that I know how that goes. keep up your work and hoping I will see you on nerdrotic stream one day.
happy belated birthday  melonie. keep fighting the good fight. remember to take care of yourself too.
also I love the way you pronounce things sometimes. I cant always tell if youre doing it intentionally to troll or be silly or if you genuinely dont know how to pronounce certain words or maybe its a regional accent thing. idk. but it amuses me every time.
melonie always does a great job  happy birthday lady.
as much as it pains me to admit it as a white myself  italians are indeed whitealso happy birthday
happy birthday melanie  lol love that intro. if they are doing it as pratt getting pulled in the mushroom kingdom world that will be very very disappointing
kevin michael richardson is black. and did the voice of joker in the jackie chan adventures style batman tv show titled the batman from 2004. he was also in season 4 of btas  episode legends of the dark knight where he was voicing mutant leader and bruce timm emulated frank millers  dkr art style. he was great in it. he has good acting range. despite studio and directorial limitations of the show which was aimed at a younger audience than lets say  btas   rip kevin conroy.
happy birthday  melonie! I hope you have a wonderful day. thank you for entertaining us.
happy birthday melonie!!!! hope you have a smashing day! I wasn t actually interested in watching the mario movie  but now Imight just go... for the support!
happy birthday melonie mac!!! hope you had a great one! big hug and thanks to your parents for creating such a beautiful   cool af badass chick!!
1st of all happy birthday mel  lol. God forbid an actor would be allowed to act in a movie  playing something he s actually not. I suppose leguizamo should be calling out himself as well  being a spanish man playing a italian man.
happy birthday  mel! your channel is great  love watching. keep it up!
love you  melonie. hope the anniversary of your nativity is amazing!
happy birthday melonie!   keep the hits coming.
yet to be revealed  but I hope he s at least somewhat recognizable.
the pest! oh  wait...
just saying.. one of the two emmy s he won for  freak  his one man show directed by spike lee that he was one of the writers on  granted I think his opinions in this are dumber than dirt. but his standup in that and  sexaholix  was a fantastic mesh of physical standup. writing and playing multiple members of his family.
@justin mcgill  thanks!  thats interesting.
well his movie  bombed. and he should be made to stay away from anything mario  his suck could contaminate a potentially good movie.
@photriuspyrelus  some of his views are beyond woke.. but seriously freak and sexaholix are easily to me high in some of the top stand up performances.. freak is damn near God tier with robin williams a night at the met is the only standup I can even think of as close in its physicality.. its a fantastic honest piece of stand-up about his life before his fame. reminds me of chris rock s first stand up bring the pain.
wym italians probably one of the most based out there besides polish. y know  they still have some self respect. I get youre joking tho lol
not the sicilians...
as an italian I never considered myself anything else  but thanks for the concession.
@tuco benedicto  well in the olden days  depending on what part of america you were from  you might have gotten lynched like the blacks for not being  white enough . and in thatsituation  often the italian americans of that region had a familiar bond with blacks  some even shared their same interest in jazz  which if you then go to italy  as my italian teacher had explained  said jazz influence carried all the way over to there.it wasnt until the mid 20th century did italians start to be  accepted  by the wasp whites and then chose to separate their former bond with blacks since they were no longer seen as minorities
I heard somewhere they are part eggplant. pretty sure they dont count.
@budgie cat  stupidity  lies  and baseless propaganda.
@marcus aurelius      uh...no lol. my teacher s literally from italy and the info is not hard to look up. even at one point germans were mistreated in the u.s. and this was way before wwI and lets not forget the irish  especially the ones from the south.
@budgie cat  it wasn t because italians were  slightly less  white which isn t even a thing but rather because they were foreigners. irish  poles  germans were also mistreated because the original white americans were exclusively anglo saxonic and anything outside of that was seen as  worse . in europe  all europeans were always seen as european -  white    caucasian  even though we dont really use those word and just say nationality instead.
@manic panic  for italians it def was the  slightly less white  angle because people thought they  and sicilians  were mixed with african blood ancestry  the moors .in any case  attacks on the italians back then in the south were factsfor the irish  it was  particularly more the south  their rambunctious nature and podunk behavior which can even be seen now  just look at how ufc fighter connor mcgregor acts . that type of behavior also inspired black people in the south after slavery was abolished which is where the whole ghetto bravado mentality came from  the irish. any irish southerner back then who would try to move up north to get work would get shoeved away once people saw their mannerisms. they were not liked.then up north the irish who were there created the police unions and thats where they got their respect even though itstarted in gangs.the polish I dunno didnt really follow them so maybe the whole foreigner thing with them applies but then again thatshould also apply for the jews but the jews have a moreconnected social structure where they aim for the 5 pillars so they can weave themselves into society and be successful which makes other people jealous.
happiest of happy birthdays lovely ms. melonie!  love your awesome commentaries!
a belated happy birthday to you  melonie! sigh  when the woke get outraged  they swing for the fences...Im sorry mister legooeyzamo  you might be starting something here!   chose your special day to signal.  we re all so tired of this identity politics crapola  being outraged for its own sake  and none of it is doing anyone any good.  ol  john just wants attention -- thats the first and really only motive of people like him!
I hope you have a terrific birthday  melonie!  thank you for proclaiming truth and the grace of Jesus
john is just living out his breakout performance as  the pest
I hope youre paying attention  class.  2022  rules are  if a role has ever had a nonwhite actor  even if that was not the original version  then said role must be played by a nonwhite actor until the end of time. seriously though  I remember when the film came out  and his casting was not  groundbreaking . if the directors had to fight for his casting at all  just maybe it had to do with the fact he was still an up and coming actor  this was his biggest role to date.  and happy birthday!
laughed all the way through this one...best pronunciation of his name Ive heard  happy birthday!
oh my God the whole I dont want to hate crackers in my soup. had me dying laughing
hey happy birthday melonie!  re-posted due to a dumb troll and bots. love your vids youre just adorable  funny and call it how it is! near that 100k subs. leguizamo is a woke tool....Im latino myself and think its dumb for a latino or any other minority to play italian plumbers who s clearly white...maybe he s trying to compete with alyssa milano this week in the  dumbest things the hollywood elite say  haha
yep she definitely seems like a scorpio.
happy birthday melonie!I cant wait to hear your voice everyday!  its my version of morning coffee! and the discord is really fun place too!
happy bday melonie may your wonderful day give more blessings to you.so much for all the hours u put into making these incredible videos.takecare melonie
happy birthday melonie!      keep up the great stuff u do and wish you all the best
happy birthday melonie. also if there s any italian american actor that would be perfect for voicing mario and have that brooklyn accent  I would say al pacino. if not then we go back to charles martinet
how do you not remember john leguizamo from such blockbusters like the live-action  spawn  and the critically acclaimed  the pest   also  happy birthday
maybe in this movie they will also tell us mario is irish as well  because irish italians  are very spicy white men. but I wonder if they are paying him to pretend to be mad about the fact they made mario that way  so it get more attention  maybe part of this is all just an act to get attention to the movie. Imean  why would anybody even get mad about something soo stupid. but this is all out of speculation. by the way this opening had me laughing so hard especially with the cracks in my soup part. last but not least  happy birthday to one of the grates women on the internet that inspire people like me to keep being me.
I think you forgot keegan-michael key as toad. in which what a good job he does with the voice. I could not tell it was him at all.
dear melonie  I absolutely adore you  never change - and happy birthday to you!
happy birthday melonie! I hope all your wishes come true when you blow on those candles.
happy birthday my favorite part is when she stutters very adorable.
happy birthday to ya melonie. appreciate the content as ever.

hmm could be onto something. after all  the luigI death stare is a popular meme gone viral for years now. so now we can attach an actual reason as to why a luigI would look pissed
@budgie cat  . just photo shop his face to the meme for now on  and there you have it.
Im 36 and I look 36  melanie looks like she still gets carded.
happy birthday mate  just had mine last friday all I can say is all these woke actors need to wake up to themselves and stop with all the crazy and just go back to acting because thats all we want out of them!
happy birthday melonie ! youreally went boom on that mic at the end of the video
happy birthday melonie  happy well-wishes and wishing you many more.
happy birthday melonie  best wishes. and may God bless you and your family.
happy birthday! melonie you go  girl  go boom!
Ive never understood why hollywood hired  movie actors  to voice popular characters in a world wide release when the actor who voices mario is still available. the characters and the franchise should be able to stand alone without a big name attacked to it. a voice is an integral element to any human  even if they re fictional. they dont go through thousands of auctions to find that unique voice for nothing and then when they re ready to make a big budget movie  hire a chris pratt or chris evans for mario and buzz
happy birthday melanie! Im guessing they re all going to ignore that none of mario s actors have ever been italian
that intro was cute lol. we ve had so many movies as of recent that has plenty of representation and more are incoming  its like they want every piece of entertainment to be dominated by poc.
happy birthday  melonie. thanks for cracking me up.
I love how youre laughing at the guy. too funny.
chris pratt was a really weird choice for voicing mario. the best thing about 70-90s movies was the art of casting choices. every  if not so little side-role  was always perfectly done
happy birthday melonie and many many more. you look very beautiful. have a great day
happy birthday!! thanks for sticking up for us white men out there  girl  love you!
happy birthday!! oh  and bob hoskins  who played mario in the previous live action mario bros. with leguizamo  was a white brit. leguizamo didn t seem to have this concern when he was getting paid.
happy birthday  I wish you spend the day surrounded by family and friends... and regarding the video  I still think that you have to train and teach a mouse and a dog to speak so that they can act like mickey and pluto cuz actors cant do it anymore.
auch this hits hard didn t expect that from john leguizamo  loved most of his movies when I was a kid and happy birthday !
happy birthday melonie! love all your videos.
the  original voice actor for mario is in the movie but he s not the voice of mario  also happy birthday!!
happy birthday   the crackers in the thumbnail  Jesus john leguizamo s descent into wokeness has been sad to watch.  Ive been a fan of the guy since his   spic-o-rama  special.  its not quite like it was finding out that hulk hogan is a piece of shit  but its on the outskirts.enjoy your birthday  melonie!
she s 36
yes! happy bday boom girl!
chris pratt is a voice actor
@saint chadam  he is not  however   mario  s voice actor.  this is like hiring ben afflec to voice batman while kevin coroy was alive.
I dont get why it has to be accurate its a movie not in the same universe. it doesnt have to be accurate you know
its for marketing purposes. especially for  kids  movies  they try to get big-name actors into itso that parents will be interested in watching it too. there s a reason the  staring role  credit is plastered on every poster. some movies do it a little better by creating new characters for these actors to voice  but that usually results in the main cast of characters being overshadowed.
@mega brick  the thing youre missing is that 30-somethings grew up with mario...  this didn t need a big name.
its solely for marketing reasons. a name like chris pratt attached to the movie has a bigger pull effect than someone only a handful will recognize. that will ultimately generate more interest and convert into more money at the box office. thats it  nothing personal.
thank you so much
nobody cared back then. now its all about trying to stay relevant. even tho leguizamo has voiced sid the sloth and bruno in encanto
he is just not playing him
he is also not luigi. you are aware that he voices many characters in the mario franchise  right
@revan 1313  I know he s not  I just cant stand chris pratts performance  itsounded like he showed up  read the script and they just kept the first take.
happy birthday! to be fair  chris pratt is so white he s almost clear. he s definetely not italian and isn t trying to do an italian accent. he just sounds like emmet pretending to be mario.
I just want actors to look like the characters they are portraying in live action movies it doesnt bother me when its voice acting I want the perfect voice though
happy birthday mel! love your content!
nacho libre comment had me laughing  I hope you had a good happy birthday melonie!
yep she s young af  she hasn t seen the mario bros movie.
sure seemed like mr. leguizamo s main beef was that he didn t get cast with no care that they didn t cast an actual italian in the role. divito might have been able to pull it off  possibly deniro who is no stranger to fantasy playing a gay pirate in stardust. pacino  probably not although he would give bowzer an offer he couldn t refuse.  I know it was you luigI  you broke my heart . happy birthday by the way!!!
I almost forgot that your birthday is really only 5 days away from the time I was born myself.  mine was on the 16th  happy b-day melonie.now to the subject  the only reason the 1993 version was memorable was it was so bad it was good. as long as I hear an italian accent  Im good.
happy birthday  sweet melonie. bless you and your family
when I found out he did luigI in the live action movie I was like thats not my luigI  thats bootleg-igI  like  seriously what were they thinking!
happy birthday melonie!  hope you get multicoloured modern cake
john leguizamo dressed up in clown face with a fat suit as the violator in the spawn movie. he foretold his own woke destiny with that one.
happy birthday mel! it would be nice to see a 100k subs for your new channel today
omg millie mac went woke!... just kidding. seriously happy birthday. hearing you pronounce each syllable of jon leguizamo s last name  you were close  made me smile. jon s real big on the identity culture thing. he has this story comedy special on netflix  latin history for morons  that is actually pretty funny and a little heartwarming. you should check it out. also because mario is the right skin color  it gives me hope it wont be a preachy woke trash movie so I ll go see it.
wishing you a happy birthday melonie!
when he was doing narration on the brothers garcia  I liked him. when he was fixing john wick s car and taking care of the mo   fu   in kick ass 2  I liked him. if he needs to grub for crappy acting jobs based on racial quotas  Im afraid Imust depart the premises. happy birthday  miss melonie!!!
melonie winked at us
so he s offended that mario is played by chris pratt instead of an italian  captain lou albano who voiced the character in the old cartoon wasn t 100  italian either he was mixed. what s next people getting upset that bowser isn t played by a snarling dragon turtle. lol its a joke but seriously lighten up john.
happy birthday!     hope you have a super awesome one! also crackers in soup is good  Ive always loved mario since I was a kid. the n64 game is nostalgic
happy belated birthday! I hope you had lots of balloons that went boom!
hey  happy birthday!!! new around here  but I love the channel. I cant help wondering if this is as much about  representation  as much as leguizamo trying to recapture his lost relevance.
she should be glad. I seen it once. once and I lost brain cells.
@angel phoenix77
happy birthday !!!!! may God bless you with many more years! also  I love your content
john leguizamo seems pretty obsessed with casting actors that are an irl representation  or as close as possible  of the characters they re going to play.anyway  pretty cool when he played violator in spawn.
I have said this before  but there are some weirdos thatsay that the native greek  portuguese and italian peoples are not white. they always do this with the greeks for some reason.
I say we go further than what john lasagna says to go. I say we remake mario in a martin scorsese period flick of a humble italian plumber who climbs his way through the cut throat society of the mafia in the 1980s literally stomping on heads  and utilizing drugs  mushrooms  to take over the illicitsubstance trade in new york. also happy b-day
that intro was amazing lol!!!happy b-day mel!!!
happy birthday melonie! keep on booming!
so glad you had a wonderful birthday melonie
Im a day late but it was probably your birthday when yourecorded but either way happy birthday. also  dude is gunna be real surprised when he finds out the guy who voices actual video game mario is white
mario is white  I thought he was a non binary gender rabbit with a wooden leg and a glass eye with a fish in ithappy birthday
happy birthday melonie! I hope you have a great one!
happy late birthday mel  hope it was a good one! honestly  I kind of always just thought italians were white people  but I guess they dont consider themselves that way lol.
omg  you mean they choose people that look like the character  btw  happy birthday
I usually dont care what race voice actors are as long as they can pull it off convincingly.  pratt I dont know he may do just fine its just a mario movie after all so Im not expecting much.  the one pick I dont care for is jack black as bowser.  I like jack black he s legit one of my favorite dudes but you cantell bowser is just some guy trying to make a deep voice.  why not hire a guy with a deep voice   dont want to seem too scary I guess.  but as I said its just a mario movie that looks like a kid movie so Im not expecting much
I think that voice acting is a talent that has nothing to do with race color  therefore anyone can play anyone when it comes to voicing a character  be it animated or 3d or whatever. now I think its a bad casting choice based on the fact that he doesnt sound like classic mario.
its a me mario!
happy birthday.   they should make mario into a maria and have her whip around some magic spaghettI and flinging pizzas as her special moves to save prince peace and the shroom kingdom.
happy birthday  melonie! have a blessed day.
mario is italian  so very italian  he and luigI could be from naples  florence  milan  genoa or rome  happy birthday btw!! I hope youre having a great day!
happy birthday melonie. hope you got what you wanted. and leguizamo got nothing.
I absolutely agree with john leguizamo  they should ve casted a spicy meatball for role of mario  and a plate of spaghettI for the role of his brother  luigi.
he played clown. violator was just cgi.
@xoulrath mtg  I dont think that the  disguise  makes him a different character but still he voiced the cgI too.
@victims  yeah  he was still the voice. but he certainly didn t  play  violator. that would have been one hell of a diet.
as a full blooded italian. I would love to know what these weirdos think I am if Im not white lol... I guess Im olive
that was a rabbid dressed up as mario. pretty cool game for an xcom clone.
well mario has 2 voice types. the italian american brooklynese accent  albano   hoskins  and the high pitched native italian voice  martinet   I imagine nintendo probbably thought the latter would have been too much for mainstream audience to hear over a the former was created before the latter actually as martinet didnt sign on until early 90s afaik. mario in the games barely speaks so its digestable to the ear in rare one to three word spurts but not in whole conversations  but pratt doesnt sound much like the former either from what we ve heard so far albeit it limited
so based
john leguizamo is just desperate to revive his dead career. he doesnt actually believe this ridiculous crap
happy birthday mmgb and we wish you many more
happy birthday beautiful! your content keeps me sane...just barely
happy birthday I just learnt that none of the women who voiced lara croft have ever raided an ancient tomb....how am I supposed to enjoy the character now lol
happy birthday mel! I just had my birthday as well last week. Im 38 years young! may this year be an awesome year for you on youtube!
happy birthday melonie! here s hoping your birthday is dynamite!!!!!
how dare a white person play an animated white person
happy birthday  girl! keep on rocking!!
my head just goes straight for danny devito for mario I dont know why it would just be funny as hell for me
happy birthday melonie mac. stick some candles in a slab of butter and celebrate
today is also my birthday. turned 22. what a weird thing to know lol. happy birthday to you too  melonie.
its funny that luigisamo can now look the part of mario and luigI due to his age. xd
investing in crypto now should be in every wise individuals list  in some month up sees time you ll be ecstatic with the decision you made today.
wishing you an awesome birthday and best wishes for you! much  much love to ya
first off happy birthday girl .second off leguizamo s comment about it being an all white cast is really inaccurate cuz toad and kamek who are played by keegan-michael key and kevin michael richardson respectfully are black actors so he s probably just ranting cuz he knows that this movie will run laps around the 1993 mario movie that he starred in in terms of both profits and reviews.
gotta love how she says  leguizamo
happy birthday mel  I hope you have an amazing week.
first off...happy birthday to a beautiful woman that tells the truth and doesnt back down from anyone no matter how rude they are to you. may Jesus bring you many more years of joy and happiness into your life and continue fighting the good fight. that being said....all this stuff about actors or actresses playing the part of a different race has been going on for years... example james earl jones voicing vader or the uncle from fresh prince of bel-air voicing shredder in tmnt. and the list goes on. thats what a voice actor does plays a character. this crap has bothered me with this woke crowd especially when hank azria stopped playing apu from the simpsons because he was being backed into a corner and caved to the pressure. I wish people would just be played by whoever fits that role no matter on race or creed just purely by professionalism. plus most american italians from brooklyn are more white european anyway with a brooklyn accent. no one s mad at captain lou albana for playing more on the tv cartoon show. people seriously need to stop bringing race into every little thing. we are going backwards. more division instead of being united. rediculous
bonus points for using my chemical romance for your birthday story!
let s be honest  he couldn t care less if green martian got the role  his only problem is that it wasn t him
in 93 absolutely..
happy birthday to you too bro! have a good one

you should react to the trailer that just came out melonie.  anyone who thinks chris pratt isn t right to play mario might change their minds after watching it!
love you and your content  but this dude is legendary and is entitled to his  wrong  opinion. he s earned the respect of at least not making itsound like he s a nobody with a hard name to pronounce.
as long as prat can do the accent I am good
happy birthday melonie. have a great day
Im just thinking that john is just pissed that he wasn t called to voice luigi.
happy birthday  melonie!!!
people got mad that chris pratt was gunna do the accent  so they made him do it in his regular voice. and now they re mad its not  ngl it is weird seeing mario speaking normally.
what I dont get is why they arent having mario have an italian accent in the movie.
somehow melonie is fricking 36.
happy birthday melonie! hope you have and awesome day.
happy birthday  melmac!sounds like lesleaziamo is a little cranky he hasn t been offered a cameo roll....
happy birthday  melonie! normally I would give you the birthday badger  but yt doesnt let me post gifs.
happy birthday  melonie!! stay beautiful and kind. go boom!!      r.g.
happy birthday ! even on super nintendo game cover mario had blue eyes  and he always has been white
happy birthday melonie enjoy the day you know you could have wait till tomorrow  for this videoso john who is south american say we are going backwards   well last time I looked at the world map italy was still a part of europe mhhhh john I would say you had luck to get casted back in the day in the first place

dang it  john!I was hoping you were one of the smart ones.happy birthday  melonie
happy birthday  gettin lovelier the older you get.
yo  it me dawg. -mario in 2022.
happy birthday melonie!!
yeah we should throw out what the original writer wanted their characters to look like so that we dont act or look backward          .oh and happy birth day mel
happy birthday melonie! and completely agree  this race thing is out of control.
cant wait for the barrio brothers movies with jamesio
uhh  yes  totally  I remembered!  thanks for the reminder  happy birthday  melonie!
I will probably get a ton of hate for this  but I still love the 1993 super mario bros live action movie.the dystopian world itset up was very intriguing and could have been the foundation for an amazing interpretation of the franchise
I love the original super mario brothers film with rob hoskin and john leguizamo
I know Im gonna be the only one to say this and totally sound like a weirdo but melonie looks so beautiful in that thumbnail picture  xd end of the communicate and thanks for your attention xd p.d. happy birthday!!!
um  so mario was created by a japanese person  right  and according to some sources  its said that mario is also japanese. so  I for one  hoped that mario was played by a japanese actor xd
happy birthday melonie    my first time seeing your video and I think its awesome keep up the good works
why is hollywood so  salatine  about this ....okay I ll see myself out.p.s. happy birthday melonie
I feel ashamed that I used to enjoy that movie as a kid just because of the barely present  fan service ....
happy birthday melonie hope its a great one
happy birthday  melonie. you are the italian soup to my diversity crackers.
7 00 its like that meme going around of disney congratulating itself on its 100th  first openly gay character . although for viewers in certain chinese  russian  and saudI arabian countries  it really would be the first.
happy birthday melonie. have a great and fantastic day  and may it be blessed
I hope they make a megaman movie like the mario movie also happy-b day go boom
happy birthday and may the force be with you.
no one ever saw a john legozomo movie they were blown with. also  happy birthday!
your giggles get me
I feel like mel has had sugar today. fess up!
happy birthday and happy holidays  melonie mac
happy birthday melanie love the content bud.
how does she not know john liguazamo  how does she not know he played luigi
happy birthday  keep up the good work.
happy birthday  melonie!
happy birthday  melonie!
and how dare they not cast an actual dinosaur reptile person as bowser lol
happy anniversary of existence melonie
leguizamo...wasn t he in the critically-panned live-action smb movie from the 90s  where his luigI didn t even have a moustache  and his co-star was bob hoskins  who was painfully english  though at least  per his wikI page  he had a brief plumbing background  mario s italian  w a brown hair blue eyes combo. he s white. having him portrayed by a white actor is a non-issue.my real issue w this movie is that charles martinet -- who had been voicing mario since 1996 -- wasn t on tap to reprise his role s   they went w two non-va randos for mario   luigi.
happy b-day      melonie!!!!
happy b-day melanie. may good fortune smile upon you
remember everyone  he s whining about a computer animated movie that involves voice acting. you know  a movie where you use your voice  instead of your body  to act out your role.
hey! happy birthday! hope you have a great and blessed day today melonie!
alright people you know what this means  when the movie comes out let s support it and just say that weird latinx guy that played as luigI on the old movie we all wanted to forget about motivated us to spend the money.
funny enough the menu had a cheeseburger lol
you ain t 36 dont lie youre 25  happy birthday melonie mac. have a great one  God bless.
what  you and my mom have the same birthday lol. happy birthday melonie! may God bless you with many more
Jesus Christ! why do they want to have change all of the great characters. also  happy birthday!
happy birthday  melonie! may the Lord Jesus bless you divinely  little sister!
happy birthday  melonie!
I think the  real  jeffery dahmer should be playing jeffery dahmer in the tv series of the same name.
well it probably wouldn t kill them to cast an actor that atleast tried to put on an italian accent lol
congrats on the birthday btw ms. mac.as others have said  how dare a caucasian actor play a caucasian character! . its almost as if that would be consistent. then again hollyweird hates consistency. except when they are telling stories. in which case european stories are the only one worth telling apparently.
we share the same birthday melonie!! happy birthday!!
apparently anya taylor-joy is actually a latina woman  she s from argentina   but no one seems to call her  latina  or  hispanic  in most contexts just because she has porcelain white skin and golden hair  which isn t her natural hair colour  she s actually brunette .
he doesnt see the irony.no matter who cast to voice mario he will still be white on screen
happy birthday melonie mac!!!
she s 35. how do I know  she was born on november 21st 1986. very easy to remember most of the time since I was born on november 16th 1986
she s not the kind of latina people think when they hear latina
as the people that have told me when I got upset they didn t stick to namor s source material  I ll tell them the same  get over it
I have no idea what race john is  nor do I care  but he plays lots of italians and hispanics. even if he is both  I doubt he is a plumber or a crimeLord or any number of other things he pretended to be. really want that hacker 4chan to get to work pushing irl career representation in acting jobs to help burn the whole tower of representation down.
I dont know if yourecorded this today or not  but happy b. day. drink responsibly!
I used to let john until now. this is  just wow
happy birthday  melonie!
happy birthday miss boom  hope you have a great day.
happy birthday! I hope you had a good one
this just shows how much social justice is really just about bullying others into giving them personally the role they want... no objective standards nor goals.
happy birthday melonie you beautiful  gorgeous heathen of a woman!
happy birthday melonie!!!
happy belated melonie!
congratulations on completing another full revolution around our solar system s star. may this new revolution be happier than the last.
this movie looks good.
yer absolutely giddy here! just a pure delight to witness on Gods earth..bravo  mac!  buon compleano!  Im half italian half irish but I could probably pass for a mario brother .with the mustache an all
happy birthday  hope you have a good one. and lol typical media screaming about no forced pandering.
shows you how well he s been doing that he s digging up something from 30 years ago to bitch about instead of focusing on new stuff.happy birthday  btw.
I want to see leguzamo go tell an italian man he ain t white.
heathen
@photriuspyrelus  sense the joke man
luigI just mad he still isn t the main character
there s so much hypocrisy they re portraying  we might as well come at them with it tenfold
happy birthday melonie!
I still love luigisimo. even if his nuts.
me at 1 10 - says the guy that played the role who played his brother in the super mario bros movie with bob hoskins. . . .
happy birthday mel. you have the same birthday as my twin daughters. I hope that you have a wonderful day.
happy birthday mel!
lol ok thats a like just for the intro!  let s get to the video! by the way since when are italians now  people of color   because that would be the only viable reason for thatstatement. or is skin color now a qualification for voice actors  beats me...anyway... happy b-day mel!
to john s defense  he was luigI in the original mario brothers movie. so he s probably upset that a latino wasn t cast  since one was cast to play luigI originally. to be fair. also  the original super mario brothers movie is one of those movies that are so bad that its hilarious.
happy birthday melonie mac
yo  we share a birthday! happy birthday melonie!
old luigI is but hurt  he wasn t asked to play him again. maybe he can be in  the pest  part 2. though now I hope the role is recast again...and given to pratt. lmfao
happy belated birthday  melanie!
if I do recall leguizamo wasn t an actual demon from hell when he played the violator in the spawn movie. what a dissapointment.
the actor s last name is pronounced  leg-we-za-mo .
happy birthday  melonie mac   cheese oh boy! white mario  who knew  lmfao!jon leguizamo played luigI in the 93  super mario movie... he isn t white  he s not even italian  thats probably why he s blowing chunks all over the new mario movie... hoskins was great as mario  may he rest in peace. the overall story was kind of dumb  but I still enjoyed it lol.
what s next is he gonna get mad at the actual voice actor for mario in the games     lol
he probably lost the role to chris. he s just upset he still doesnt have a bigger profile in hollywood. he should have with stuff he did earlier in his career  I think  but Im not in charge of hollywood.
happy birthday!  have a fun one!
john looked nothing like luigi. he was a famous actor and thats what drew them to hire him back then
funny enough  jon leguizamo in his movie  the pest   1997  he played a chinese character  a japanese character  a jewish character  an african character  and a germen character  I have no problem with racial humor myself  but he seems to flip flop on races and characters now a days.
I wouldn t have an issue if he wasn t being a pest now a days lol. I dislike people whom sit upon high horses.
@eric bolton  agreed
for context  leguizamo is the actor so bad he couldn t grow a mustache for the role of luigI back in the 90s.
every time you pronounce that name  hahaha
if thats true I never want to see any voice actor play another race again. rolls eyes
his name s pratt  chris pratt. and he s not into that.
happy birthday melonie  its funny how your name without the e at the end is the same as the based prime minister of italy
happy birthday melonie!!
Im outraged the mario brothers are being renamed mario broes.
0 55  leg gooey zah mo
happy birthday  mel!
the original super mario brothers movie was one of the earliest examples of race-swapping  louigI .
crap  Ive been mispronouncing leguizamo for like 30 years.
happy birthday  cheerful girl!
wait hold up  there s a generation that cant pronounce john leguizamo naturally anymore
happy birthday to the most beautiful woman in the world
you have the same birthday as my sister  itseems. and speaking as an italian who is sick to death of identity politics  thank you.
I stumbled upon this video and I realize we share the same bday
I have an idea for you melanie.  Im not sure if youre an actor  but in today s world its perfectly ok if you identify as a ham sandwich.   so identify as both an actor and a ham sandwich and insist that you should get the part of luigI as a poc.  thatshould make not italian luigI happy wouldn t you think   lol!
happy birthday ms. mac
I haven t even watched the whole video yet   Im like  fu legaizamo!  youre just hopping on the bandwagon seeking attention for this one! . looking forward to violent santa where you co star with a white lead who I suppose should also not have been white.  how dare they make santa be white in 2022!happy birthday melonie!!!
aw thank youuuu!
hbd mel. have a great day!
happy b-day melonie!!!
Im choosing to ignore the utter stupidity of the article referenced and just say  happy birthday  melonie! go boom  girl!
great video and recent subscriber. happy birthday mel
dont know why a voice behind a cartoon matters what race it is. for kids  they wont know or care  they ll just be happy to see mario
hbd thanks for all the videos!
I ll acept a black mario if they include that  bowsette  from the internet too.
american adaptations of japanese video games and animes rarely turn out well. you need only look at street fighter  ghost in the shell  and  the resident evil films to see this.
Imade you a fancy birthday card. I sent it to you on instagram lol
happy belated birthday mac
I dont even understand why john l is complaining - he was just in encanto as the character bruno. that movie is all about latino rep and its a solid movie to boot. does he want to play luigI again that badly
late to the party but happy b day anyways  miss mel
happy birthday!! from a new fan
happy birthday  you dont look a day over 30 or whatever generic compliment.
john s been sour ever since he played drag in to wong foo.
Im italian and I dont care that mario is a stereotypical character of my country. how an actor which is not even black can complain this much to a useless topic. I dont think thatsomeone in the casting rejected a good actor just because he was black. happy birthday melonie!
happy bday melonie
happy birthday  miss melonie! eternal baby face will be yours forever  I think.    seems to me Ive just lost some respect for john leguizamo...pity  he s actually really funny when his ego isn t getting in the way.
happy birthday! and I totally didn t forget  even got you a gift. but left it in the car  and shuks my car is in the shop.... I will give it next time! also isn t  keegan-michael key a black man doing the voice of toad who looks white  we re just gonna ignore that  okay cool
hope you have a happy and safe birthday!
so as long as they sound right for games and animation a person s skin colour dosnt matter you   should   pick whoever is best for the job  what an odd idea that is  a good example of this is Christopher judy who is the current voice of kratos and also voiced eric magnus lenshur aka magneto  I actually dont think you can get a character more white than kratos unless you do a joker and soak them in bleach but jude s voice is perfect for kratos. as for mario as far as I know he was meant to be at least a first generation american maybe even second gen aka he was born and raised their  if their not casting a yank then its a japanese person  highly unlikely as they tend to draw their characters to look american  or an italian and the population density of italy is something like 97 white maybe even higher than thatso odds are mario a character that was originally made as a white guy will look white sound wise they probably should have gone with the guy who has been voicing him in the games for years but hollywood has this dumb thing about keeping actors separated into different groups and not letting actors that have played that role in tv for years do the role in the film for some reason.
got dang it  we gen xer s didn t invest our money in super mario bros. to hear the title bastardized years later. the  bros.  part is spoken as brothers  its in the english lexicon  take the period off and youre good with a happy birthday to boot!
happy birthday. wish God bless s you with many more.
happy beer-day!! may the cake go boom xd  3
I wonder what john thinks about al pacino  italian  playing tony montana  cuban . its an old hollywood casting stereotype to have italians play latinos and visa-versa.
they could have cast tony cox as toad  problem solved... Im actually sure he would have nailed the role too. oh wait  keegan got that role...
ok... so  I ll be the voice of reason here in regards to what john is saying.  if you dont know this   john has been a proponent for latinos  he calls them latin-x for gender neutral reasons  for many years now and has been poppin  off about how the film industry refused to embrace more talented latin actors in their big film projects. he scanned through the new mario bros upcoming film cast  after he was asked his opinion of it  and noticed that no latino  or latinx  were cast in any prominent roles for the film. so he made the statement of his disappointment on twitter. he wasn t actually being specific just to mario either. the articles have been cleverly painting it that way  giving the impression that john was calling for  a person of color   article insinuating he meant someone perhaps of black decent  etc  to play as mario.  he was being general. he never even mentioned chris pratt.  one can speculate  john was hoping he could come in and play the role of one of bowser s koopa kids. who knows. nothing more was said  except he jested he was  o.g.    meaning he got to star in the original movie which his casting people fought hard to get him the part  and that he d be the only one to know how the make the script work  movie wise...which ehm...  okay. sure john. loljohn means well  as Ive seen him fight for the latin community for many years. he s got a good heart. he simply speaks his mind and of course... as melanie mac herself knows best  you dont always make fans that way.all he did was simply share his disappointment to his fans  which of course was picked up by content hounds to blast online for clicks and views to their articles. however  yes  I do find some of this inconsistent to some things he talked about in the past. if you scanthrough john s history in the entertainment industry  you ll see this isn t the first time he s said something where he felt strongly over. but he doesnt go out of his way to attack people with malicious intent  but he does have a snappy tongue sometimes  since he has always been a more comedic talent . so... there it is. I followed john s work for years. I do like the guy. but he is also getting older now  62 yrs  and I do reckon we might be seeing him become more unhinged as many senior citizens do on social platforms.ps. I love the original mario bros movie. its no masterpiece...but its a silly feel good kinda 90s movie.dont judge me. lol
happy birthday melonie I hope you have great day that makes you want to say mama mia!
I dont think anybody who worked on the original mario bros movie has any ground to complain about  accurate representation  of anything.
voice acting should matter even less. all we care about is that the voices match the character in the film. brain dump did an awesome explanation on this concept when the simpsons removed the character apu from the series.
mario was never italian at all he was based on it only like look at mario s world he lives in the games it is different from ours
there s a similar drama going on with bleach anime  the va for chad declined to return to the role  because his white
happy birthday melonie !
I hope you enjoyed your birthday scorpio
well happy birthday! God bless! its my daughter s birthday too  very cool.
you made me feel so old when you couldn t pronounce leguizamo s name. but anyway  yeah  he is being ridiculous about this.
best thing leguizamo has ever done is sid the sloth.
honestly in the 1993 movie he loooked very close to a white guy and would pass as italian  some italian have really tanned face
so he is ok with kind of appropriating luigI  an italian plumber  by pushing that him the actor is more latin  but its not ok the other way around  I swear there was a word for that. . .
happy birthday!!
the only things that bother me is that mario dosnt have an accent and bowser dosnt sound monstrous enough he should sound scarier
I only have one issue with her. she keeps saying she is a Christian  but from what I was taught in the years I went to church   your not supposed to have an attitude and talk so much crap. I even heard her saying your not supposed to be fat. I would like to hear her say that to people at her church if she even attends. I dont have a problem with her saying any of the things she says  but it does clash with Christian beliefs talk the way she does.
le-gooey-zarmo never change mel  and happy birthday.and since when are italians latino
I dont personally like chris pratt is mario but if its because I feel like mario should have an italian accent  not having one just feels like its not properly portraying the character  let s go just isn t the same as let s-a go
happy birthday.I cant believe some of these people dont know italians are caucasians lol  sid the sloth needs to do a tiny bit of research lolalso voice actors can be whatever cause no one sees them. example  look who plays kratos in gow. he s playing a white guy lol. actors in shows should have a resemblance to the characters they play. doesnt have to be the same as you said  just pass. girl any hair tips lol please. shampoo or after wash care   my hair is like yours  but poof xd
happy birthday melonie! youre right  that trailer was fire. I haven t been excited to see a movie in a long time  but that one I am.also  am I the only one that didn t know luigI was latino in the first movie  I always thought he was a darker skinned italian because  you know  the mario bros are italian.
looks like its more about his ego than race. he should try to step up his game and improve his craft rather than go into a blaming spree. its sad because I enjoyed him in land of the dead. also  happy birthday melonie!
that hat makes you even prettier
another example of a latino playing italians is andy garcia. he s played many italian characters but I dont mind because he does such a great job. you dont hear me yellin that hes stealin my peoples stories. actually  if we think you did a good job we take you as one of our own
happy birthday  mm!
happy birthday fellow scorpio!
mario s skin color looks pretty much the same as always...
happy birthday miss mac!
first  there are very white italians. also  mario is actually from brooklyn  of italian descent  so not necessarily full on latino. then if only origins or skin color matter to voice act  then he s closing doors on himself to not be casted to voice act for white characters....and Imean sure  I would have liked a better brooklyn italian accent  or something closer to the interpretation of the og va  charles martinet. the french version sounds a lot closer to the og in term of cartoony energetic voice  without going into an extra corny italian impression
happy birtday!!!  stay awesome!!!
even miyamoto himself who created the character stated he is from brookyln. you literally fight donkey kong in new york in the original dk. charles marinette created the stereotype italian voice for him because mario is from italian descent. mario even has a brooklyn accent in the original mario bros super show cartoon.this just goes to to show that the people upset about all this literally have 0 zeroooo knowledge about mario and its pathetic
ever been to argentina or uruguay   both countries have the largest italian diaspora in latin america. in fact the pope francis  lionel messI  queen maxima  neatherlands  the late diego maradona are examples of latinos with italian ancestry.
first off happy birthday      . john leguizamo makes absolutely no damn sense either he s legitimately joking or he s on hard drugs. and its ironic that people were complaining about chris pratt voicing mario because his voice didn t match the character but now its because he s white  aren t they aware that mario is in fact white he s italian and the only one who s been miscast here was john leguizamo as luigI in the live-action movie many years before. but I feel like he knows that he just said this stupidity to stay relevant to promote a movie he s currently in.
I love the thumbnail.
ok but is it melanie s birthday today or not because I feel she was dropping so many hints but I am still unsure. on a serious note  this guy needs to reflect a little. he is angry that they didn t get latinos to play italians in a movie. so latinos   italians   idk I haven t studied cultures extensively but Im pretty sure they are not the same  so he is not even sincere about what he is advocating  he is just upset he has nothing to do with it.also  he s the only one that could make the script work  why  how  this guy is so full of himself that he doesnt even realize he is the epitome of a hollywood actor while referring to hollywood as being something separate from himself.
1  happy birthday! 2  somebody tell the pest that it is an animated movie!  that no one is seeing the actors!
the woke are going to lose their collective hive mind when this movie drops and I cant wait to see that happen. its a story about a white male hero who is on a mission to rescue a princess. I can already hear the  reeee s . also  happy birthday!
yeah its not like people can get a job because they re a good fit for the role now a days  its all totally because they have to be a particular color
cool. we re both november born. happy birthday melonie.
the man played luigI without a mustache. for that alone any opinion he has about who should be cast is void.
she was smoking the good birthday stuff before she did this video. lolololo!
chris pratt just doesnt sound right as mario  but thats not a knock on chris pratt. I like him. this is just gonna be a tough sell for anyone who voices him.its just we re all used to mario sounding a certain way because he s spoken the same way since 1996. but we really cant have the  its a me!    atsa so nice!   wa-hoo!!!  version of mario be the main character of a feature film. he s adorable  we know him and love him  but there s a reason he doesnt have a lot of important dialogue in the game. its like  okay  we had our cute cutscene with bowser and peach  now get rosalina or a talking hat in there to do the real exposition.  its a conundrum. yeah  some of us older fans remember to old animated shows  but that was before there was a quarter century precedent set for how these characters sound.
wait  have you never seen thatsuper mario bros movie  this just wont do. you gotta watch that for your channel  its a sight to behold. its bad  but in a fascinating way.
hold up isn t it an animation !
happy bday melonie. Im more upset about the fact that they didn t cast a mushroom to be the voice of toad.   . guess we re in the phase now where all lead roles have to go to non-white non-male non-hetero sexual people.
oh yeah - happy birthday melonie  d  d  d  d
there are white italians  and mario is voiced by someone  chris pratt. is that portrayed  are italians  people of color   what even is a  person of color  at this point  mario is a cartoon with white skin  brown hair  and blue eyes. how about charles martinet be mario since he has voiced the character forever.edit  since when is italian a race
mario must be played by an actor of  colour ... the people who assert this are the same people who have decreed that all europeans  including  yes  italians  may only be classified as generically  white .
hey good morning and good afternoon melonie. I just wanted to tell you and wish you a happy 36th birthday today and I hope you enjoy your birthday today with your lovely family and hope you get birthday gifts that you were asking for from your family  ok melonie. anyway I just wanted to tell you that and I just wanted to make a comment about this video that I just dont understand why there is so much of problems having a issue with race in video games that makes into movies  anyway I just dont understand bout that. also in the main old classic super mario video games that they show that mario is white male and his friend luigI is white male and the princess is white female in the video games and so I just dont understand what is so much of problem and issue that the new super mario movie character is white which itshows that he is white male character in the video games. anyway I just wanted to make a comment about this topic of this video and I just wanted to tell you and wish you a happy birthday  to you  ok melonie. anyway I hope you have a wonderful and great blessed day today on your birthday  and I hope you continuing to have a wonderful and great blessed day and evening with your family and have a good night too melonie. anyway God bless you and God bless you on your birthday .
ha ha ha  funny video!  and as a southern italian american immigrant  I acknowledge that I am white and I dont care about being called that! mario is what mario is. let the good times roll and rest in peace bob hoskins
happy birthday  now give us black mario!!! wakanda forever!!!!
you know  for some reason when you butcher so many people s names left and right doesnt bother me at all but when other youtubers and streamers I watch do one slip up it ruffles my feathers. maybe you instantly just make it funny enough  I dunno...
also happy birthday melanie! thanks for being so awesome
I just didn t want pratt to voice him because I dont think his voice fits mario. as long as your voice can match mario Im all good
happy birthday melonie!
I wouldn t say that trailer was epic  most of it was  but chris  voice just did not match the visual at all. dont get me wrong  I love chris  but his voice just didn t work in that little bit we saw at all. and I think maybe they know it cos he was in so little of it and they knew jack black hit it for a 6  or for the american reading this... knocked it out of the park . I hope they do what they did with sonic  hear the criticism and go back and change it. get chris to work on his brooklyn accent more. or at least hopefully that was an early take and he has already improved it.
happy birthday melonie...
man  the one who played violator in spawn  the man who played the one silly sid the sloth from ice age throwing a fit over a white character being portrayed in a movie based on a game of a white man. are you kidding me  this guy has gone woke too  damn! for the record  italian people aren t latin folks john.
I pray the Lord blesses you with a abundant amount of birthdays!
happy birthday melonie.
Im an american of italian descent  and while I think leguizamo is a clown  I also think that mario s accent paints him to be either an italian who just happens to be speaking english  or a first or second generation italian immigrant. so unless chris pratt intends to do an italian patois  which has its own problems   I think he is wrong for the role. as it is just voice acting  they should have cast charles martinet who voices mario in the games. I understand that they think they need  star power  in order to sell the movie  and probably wouldnt want to pay charles martinet the kind of wage that the lead role in a hollywood film would command  but I think thats part of what makes a production like this so inherently flawed to begin with. just cast a bunch of decent voice actors and dont pay them much  you dont need these b list hollywood clowns to appeal to parents.
happy birthday melonie!!!
let s think about this... mario and luigI are italian! if nintendo does what disney has done   nobody will buy their games!
an asian max creates italian characters and a latino feels entitled to play them   some people consider this progress.
happy birthday  you absolute unicornedit  isn t toad being voiced by a black dude
john is just jealous because of two things. 1  the mario movie he starred in was absolute trash  that he himself regretted being in. 2  john s most well known film role is a Goddamn sloth!
wait  so if you have a gay trans jewish etc character you must use a gay trans jewish etc actor but if you have white characters then you must use not white actors also hap birdday and that intro was just adorkable.
wow... john has been on something lately.his older stand up and house a buggin were awesome.this new john... not so much.
wait for a couple years and we will get a mario game with a dark skinned main character.we began with mario... then  at some point  we got wario and now we will get  ario. because we need to be inclusive. he will have dark skin with asian features  will wear a rainbow colored shirt and  instead of rescuing a princess  he will rescue his boyfriend.we need to be inclusive!!can we find a way for  ario to be female  no  such a shame.
happy birthday mel!
so a latino playing an italian isn t taking a job away from someone else  but someone else playing the italian character who isn t latino is  that is some mental gymnastics there!
I still dont care for chris pratts voice for mario. it is a cartoon  but the original voice was set for years. I have a hard time taking in his voice from what I expect. the french voice actor did great and the italians did great  but chris kind of falls flat. as it isn t just the voice being brooklyn  but the voice is a portrayal of a portrayal.
how dare you not discriminate against white actors!  how dare you not be racist!   how about they just cast the person thats best for the job   criticism of whether that individual is best for the role is one thing  but saying individual white actors should not be cast because they re white is just racism.  everyone has to work  everyone should be treated equally  and discriminating against them over skin color is pure hypocrisy.
lol  had you been drinking before recording this  or were you just extra manic in this one  lol it was funny anyhow!
ironically the casting staff for the castro movie took things very seriously. dna testing revealed franco to have ancestors within the same region of spain that fidel  claimed  his family had been from. how accurate the information given to fidel from his parents on this subject matter could of course be debated. but as per usual  there is no pleasing these people. best to not even play the game.
happy birthday  melanie!!
if anyone needed another reason to dislike the original mario movies.
happy birthday melonie.dont worry  Im sure princess peach will be written as a grammy award winning deaf-mute  transgendered rebel-sexual gender studies professor of color.I wish I were joking.
oh no he s white!!  even though his original voice actor is also white   how could they do this!!  happy birthday!!
they hired a european guy to play a european guy  how dare they he is totally fine when he a hispanic guy plays an italian guy  luigI  but outraged when an italian guy  franco  gets to play a hispanic guy  castro   the hypocrisy of these people is incredible. they want a stacked system where heads they win and tails we lose  the last thing they want is actual equality.
happy birthday! team november 80s babies untie!
if it was up to the left democratic activists we all would be required to wear arm bands  indicating everything about each person
the only thing about the casting thats infuriating for me is not using charles martinet who s been voicing mario since apparently 1992 - most noteably for me starting with super mario 64 in 1996. he is the voice of mario and  no hollywood studio is going to change that. also - happy friggin birthday melonie!
happy birthday  ms. maccccc
mario is the most diverse character out there. he s an italian  who looks like a mexican  born in japan  speaks english   jumps like a black guy  and grabs coins like a jew . get that racist crap out of mario s life.also happy birthday. funny  today is my dads birthday as well.
happy belated birthday!
when I watched the movie darkest hour I was outraged that the role of winston churchill was played by a white male actor. they should have cast a strong black woman to play churchill to ensure the movie appealed to a modern audience.  btw Im being sarcastic here!
happy birthday! btw. what about disney ceo change  instead of bob iger returning  they should take the opportunity and place a poc in a position of power  I wanna see a non-binary black dwarf as disney s ceo.
luigI complaining that minions inc s super mario movie when the one he was in was a massive failure  all because mario is white... the cast has a couple of black people in it. keegan michael-key is freaking toad of all characters pthe moral of this video  words are hard  lol.
melonie  your nativity is enduring. luigisamo didn t get the part because he looked like luigI  he got the part because in that abomination of a film  luigI was mario s adopted brother. luigI never had a mustache and was barely taller than bob hoskin s 5 6  mario. in the games  cartoon  comics  etc. they are clearly related and luigI is about a head taller than mario. just watch the film and you will see the film makers had less respect for the source material than woke directors do today.
I go full ret rd when Im happy  I dont even drink
@melonie mac go boom  hey tropic thunder!!!
james franco and fidel castro are of iberian ancestry. the same can be said about selma hayek  her mother is spaniard  dad asian arabic   charlie sheen  martin sheen  rachel zelger  gloria estefan  asturian   eva mendes  eva longoria  mario lopez 11th great-grandfather was a conquistador mercenary  the list goes on.
most accurate description
eh  mario doesnt look mexican  per se  he s kind of a stereotypical italian american look.
mario isn t italian enough  he isn t transgender enough  he isn t feminine enough.  melonie is hilarious   .  I kind of liked john leguizamo as an actor but he is dead wrong on this one.  this is a digital animation movie who gives a shit who the voice actors are on this.  the movie clips so far are right on the money with the original ip of the characters that God awful 1990 s film with john was anything but.  melonie saying maybe cast actors that look like the part they are portraying very well said.  how did that 90 s movie perform at the box office one of the biggest bombs of the decade something to be really proud of on your resume.  how dare they go full white when that is what the original ip was created from the japanese
I dont want no crackers in my soup  I dont know why I found that funny but I ll have to find a use for that one of these days.
...people really dont understand the difference between a nationality and a race. so here s a newsflash everyone   italian  is not a race. its a nationality that includes many different races  including spanish and caucasian. italy is a country...people who reside there are italian. and the majority of people who legally live in italy are spanish and white....so yes  mario can easily be white and italian. just since nowadays we need a deep dive into every little practicality for the almost illiterate.
freudian slip. cinematic version.
just to throw this in  mario s game voice is done by a white guy doing a stereotypical italian accent  nothing against it but I want the hypocrites to know. also mario s originally from brooklyn and his first voice was a scruffy brooklyn accent like danny devito. nintendo giving mario a generic voice is not far-fetched knowing mario s real origins. also people forget about the old super mario cartoons where mario bros is from brooklyn  the brooklyn aspect of mario is a canon. just to inform being a mario nerd
isn t a black man frpm the past and future thats voicing kratos a literal pale skinned spartan from greece mythology
happy born day  melanie!!
haha! john hasn t been relevant since the 90s  and even then he was a joke  not due to him being a  comedian.   he talking is taking everyone backwards to the tragedy that was the live action super mario bros movie.
happy birthday sis    God bless you!
he s continuing the stupid demands of skin color based hiring for voice acting. john s just salty he wasn t cast for luigi. he had his time in quite possibly the worst adaptation ever made  and he should just move on.
nobody really cared about bowser voicing by a white guy  seems like everybody likes jack black s take.
oof  someone needs to tell these people that italians are white also happy birthday!
when it comes to voice acting I dont think it matters what race an actor is. all those people that got butthurt after 30 years of hank azaria voicing multiple people on the simpsons was pathetic. john leguizamo is a hypocrite he got butthurt when james franco was announced to play fidel castro because he s white  yet john has played italian a few times.
he sounds desperate for attention also happy birthday melonie!
considering it wasn t always so  we should be applauding that in 2022 italians are considered white again. a win for progress.
animal crackers and a mic drop in this vid. dang  an off the rails happy birthday to u!
leguizamo was cast as luigI because he is light skinned olive colored  not because he is hispanic.  this stupidity of his and his overt racism is just dumb.
happy b-day  I absolutely knew this
italians are white. so are greeks and spaniards  by the way. half of south america is also white. indians are technically white  even though they have darker skin. arabs are white. there are only four races  though some people think ethnicity   race.
the most accurate casting of all-time was making john leguizamo into a clown in spawn.personally  Im absolutely shell-shocked that john would be a part of a misogynist film such as the menu.  um  get with the program  john.  you should ve demanded it be called   the womenu.   what a patriarchal fascist.
Christopher judge  and everyone loves him and loves kratos  no one had any problem with that.
@icewolf_ssj  exactly so it doesnt matter who or what voicing an animated 3d plumber people need to grow up and get out of this bashing straight white men and Im black saying this.
dont tell that to quentin tarantino and Christopher walken  you end up like poor dennis hopper.
happy birthday . mine was also some days ago  but enjoy yours. have a great cake  and presents!
happy birthday ms. melonie

happy birthday!!!
I think it was the 1993 movie that had inappropriate casting. who can suspend their disbelief enough to see bob hoskins and john leguizamo as brothers
happy birthday melonie
as a former mcu fan agree Im ashamed of making some ppl get into this shit years ago
happy b day!!!
mario is white because he s italian  and because his japanese creator made him white.

happy birthday mel.  some of these folks are just stirring the pot to try and be relevant  so screw him.
first happy birthday ms melanie. also you just cannot fix stupid  duct tape will only muffle it  and a baseball bat will get you 10-20 years. thing is john leguizamo forgot that old ass super mario movie tanked all those years ago. so maybe  just maybe they do not want to have much of anything related to thatsteaming pile of a failure. except for those few or so that did enjoy it for what it was..... something that mystery science theater could mock in one of their shows for one of a few examples.
happy birthday

how is this going on   does he mean all the red-head characters that has been raceswapped with black women
literally all you need to do is use the same argument these ppl use with a black roman playing ariel.  hey guys! its a fictional character  he s not real and skin color shouldn t matter
a sagittarius  the most philosophical of the signs. me too  but I dont believe in all thatshit. I just want to get my kicks before the whole shithouse goes up in flames. -paraphrasing jim morrison
happy birthday
happy birthday  yeam scorpio
happy-birthday
!! happy birthday!!! sagittarius did not see that capricorn jeyeah.... hey  couldja tell them ecco...is ...a dolphin.....
he is mexican and he was portraying a italian. also italian are latinos because his language is derivative also from latin like spanish. but he is just embarasing him self. in animation the aspect or race from the actor is meaningles. but it wouldn t heart take an italian actor for the job. cris prat sound just like him self. someone who could gave mario an italian accent wouldn t heart
happy birthday lovely
happy birthday
happy b-day
ah what   happy birthday from a newcomer!!and dude  he s a fictional italian brothers and  mushroom   white princess made by japanese men for a video game!! wtf!  people are insane! please leave the movie alone  please!!!!!
does he know its an animation  and we wont even see chris preatt or the other  white  or  non white  guys  and in other countries the one speaking will be chinese or indian or whatever ...
I prefer the term  saltine american .
happy solar return
Im  german  italian  with blonde hair blue eyes .  peoples ethnicity  is complicated so are genetics.
so wait. Im italian. now Im I a person of color good to know
no crackers in my soup!!!!!!  ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
nachooooooooo!!!!!!
I am also white
happy bday
that moment when people dont realize that italian is technically white so the argument is a bitstupid that an italian is played by a white actor
its so funny to me that they say  stop appropriation!  while praising the  re-imagining  of ariel  but ok
happy b-day
who tweets the best  jenn lawrence or ligeuziamo
he fails to recognize that his version of smb was an utter failure at the box office. or  maybe thats why he s so woke salty.
really  really . really  reeaallly   really
john legwizamo pretended to be puerto rican for decades before his parents outted him out is upset that a white guy is pretending to be a white guy in a movie.legwizamo literally pretended to be puerto rican in real life  calling himself boriqua   saying he represented taino culture.
they re mad about an italian chats yet that looks exactly the same in the film as all other media  imagine being white and male where they replace everyone with a female or poc. that being said  Im not going to see the movie cause he doesnt have the accent. thats stupid. other than that the movie looked incredible I thought. wait  they re made the casting is close to accurate and not because he wasn t entirely reimagined as a poc. dang. people are stupid.
hb2u!!!
people really need to get help
happy late birthday sorry I didn t see your video yesterday I was moving
he did not say a black man he said a person of color
and I have lost all respect for him.
no floor pupper today.
happy bday....
happy bday.  ironic he should whine about appropriation.
when I watched the live action mario movie  I didnt see luigI as a latin man  to me he was a white man. movie was dubbed so dunno if he had a latin accent or something  but up untill this year to me he was always a white man.
just an indirect way of saying how cool white people are in my opinion. haters are going to hate. they cant create cool stories on their own.
john legumezano he s a vegetable.
when was the last time leguizamo was relevant. he s barely been on anyone s radar beyond voicing sid the sloth.
happy birday
its luigi-samo like luigImario s brother not luui-guee-samo just saying but its leguizamo le goozamo
who s birthday is it
you mean europeans are european  literally how do that logic tho  me too antiwhite to understand
a black guy is voicing toad and the majority of characters in this movie are toads soo the majority of the voices are black.
luigisamo is offensive af.
nacho
too much butter gives a girl the giggles.
we italians aren t even caucasian. isn t that poc enough for 2022  dont touch ma mario! mamma mia!
lol
its a voice acting role so no-one sees the actor so why would ethnicity matter
lagueeezieamoo
bob hoskins was a white british man  much like myself. why was it okay for him to play mario and this guy to act alongside him  but now its not
not even buttered crackers  and melonie ever hear of the bad comedy  walk like a man ...... yes howie mandel playing a dog..... any thoughts
mario  not marco
bob hoskins was white and he played mario in the 90s.
this coming from a man who played sid the sloth  this is hilariously so hypocritical in so many ways.
Im upset that jeffy isn t in the movie.
he s from brooklyn
that 93 film sucked. yet a few years ago I got a extended cut and at least saved the narrative. btw. happy f n birthday!
rocky marciano  white  jake lamotta  white
my bday is on thanksgiving day this year
who s tired of this divisive narrative in hollywood
italians look pretty white to me...
leguizamo lost all right to claim  racism  after he embraced  latinx  as an identity. we  the latin community  wash our hands with thatsell-out coward
john can ligmazamo
mario is italian  not white
leg wI zah mo
choose you. best girl
john legeuizamo is not italian.  not sure what he s getting at.
he s not white he s italian! just like me! I am finally represented in something that isn t about my people extorting and murdering!
mario has always been white. he s italian  and here s a secret for. this may be a bit mind blowing but... italians are white.
damn I had my bday too bu yesterday
damn right
says the latino who portraited an italian luigi.
bummer. I used to like that guy.also  does anyone think rebooting this is a good idea
happy birthday  mine was a few days ago on the 19th. also these people do know the voice of mario has been the whitest oldest dude  also awesome  since mario 64 in 1996. he has been voiced by a white dude for 26 years. and everyone loves the voice. like seriously  talk about a huge nothing burger.
we need to focus on the real problem which is that chris pratt s voice acting is just awful for this role
so the hispanic man who played an italian is upset that the new mario is  race swapped .  lol okay.
bonne f te
too bad the characters look like they always have.
I was a little kid watching smb in the movies.  nobody  and Imean nobody gave a damn john was playing luigi.  audiences and the media give zero fucks.  the movie sucked  but if it was made today they d call everyone who hated the movie racist because they didnt like that luigI was latino.  oh  sorry   latinx
I dont know what they are complaining about I dont even care that much about mario. I still dont think I like the choice they made for who they cast as mario. it has nothing to do with a racial thing.
oh boy  staying true to the most obvious source material.  if you think the movie version is bad  play mario 64.
she is wasted
why are italians trying to oppress the japanese  thats all I want to know.
its a japanese property they can put whatever they want in their movies or games. he is a voice for a cartoon character. if they wanted a certain sound for the character that is what they wanted. they need to get over it. kratos and his voice actors were both black what does it matter. this is too much social manipulation.
happeburfdeh!!!
I always liked his work  but I guess f him as a person huh.
italians and white people still fall under the same category to me ngl  its like a russian or german dude getting mad thatsomeone calls them white and not russian german.
personally I wont see the movie because chris pratt isnt even trying to do a voice  its just chris pratt doing his own voice  its quite lame because past voice actors actually tried
we are all mixed. we are all mutts. we are all human. class dismissed.
just shows you hollywood actors dont know a thing about geography or who comes from where because they all live on mars
italians are white  just not northern european  so that confuses some people.
@s r   some people    americans
uh oh white people exist     merry birthday melonie!
what a woke crybaby doesnt he realize that mario is a fictional character also happy birthday melonie
uh  italian is white I thought
in his movie they literally cast an obese black lady to play the role of the fat fish from the game.
happy cake day!!!also why tf is everything about race with these people.its so played out and tiring.
no no no...mario is actually mari-o a trans women who has organisms with the help of women chip tm .... she loves the tubes  smashing turtles at the club
Im more upset they didn t hire an actual plumber and hired an actor instead. not only that  they hired an american actor to portray and italian. how dare they  are there no italian actors anymore  so he doesnt want white to portray a cuban  but want other races to portray whites  do these people listen to themselves  also  all latin influenced languages are gender based. no such think as latinx. the ignorance on these people is amazing.
I thought luigisamo was italian which would make sense as luigI is italian. not to mention the irony of  latino  coming to refer to the least latin group of people on the bloody planet... Im so disappointed it the world right now.ps stop using latinx!
I could care less who plays him but I think its wack asf that he wont have a accent thats really stupid to me
Jesus loves u so love him
everyone is getting offended but the a italians. leguizamo   was were  needs to not draw attention to his monstrosity of a film version of mario.
I am confused  italians are european.         so what in hell is going on here.
latin n white people are technically the same persons im a white male latino myself im brazilian that really makes zero sense at all lol
being connected to the original mario movie is not a positive on anyone s resume  especially when trying to give their opinion on video game movies. no one cares about the race of a voice actor. are we going to complain that jack black s white and not a turtle monster
hot take. leguizamo was hot back then and that mario movie was trash.
he s not even italian he latino ans the fame was made by a japanese company with voice was american and the bob hopkins was english he needs to grow up
last I checked italy was part of the eu that means white folk dont it  this is a fictional story that is more accurate to the source material than most  best on a true story-story-story  movies out there  haha!
does john over here own a mirror  so he should not have been in the mario bros movie by his own take. toad in this new movie is a black man.. shredder  white villain dude in the old tmnt series  was voiced by a black man..
the only role leguizamo was good at was as violator  an asshole clown demon.  you know  like he is in real life.
dont use the x word esa
back in the day italians where a minority
get it right. mario has never been a straight white male. he s japanese italian. representaciooon!
go to a cookout with mostly black folks and point to a group of us lighter skins  and tell them to pick out the italian from the bronx.... news flash we are all white.
I hate that latin x term.
yup  hollyweird already on the all female-trans remake.God Imiss the 80s.
I prefer the more politically correct term saltine americans
2 20 oh its that guy I had no idea who he was till now  and now that I do keep him the heck away from any film he was crap  everthing in that film was crap even bob hopkins sucked in that film  rest his soul  if someone started a campaign to et the game on the mario brothers film ied donate to it because that film deserves to be buried in the desert where no one will ever see it again.
funny thing is  italians aren t that white to begin with  to say nothing of sicilians.
so if they cast a black man for donkey kong wouldn t that be racist   asking for a friend.
legoman is so irrelevant hes looking for hate clout noice... happy bloody b day
leguizamo is a good actor but just like any actor in hollywood he is an idiot. he was phenomenal as the djinn of the ring in 1001 arabian nights. he was also the clown violator in spawn.
have these complainers ever visited europe
melonie  dont say  cracka  too much  you are triggering me!!
italians are not  latino  for a start.  just ask  em . go to spain or italy and itseems like  whilst they consider themselves  latin   latino seems reserved only for the spanish speaking folks in the americas  who are a genetic mix of the native tribes and spanish   portuguese colonials.
last I checked italians and italian americans are white.
what do they want to make mario an ethnic gay trans now
mario should be an islamic asian trans man in a wheelchair or  notmymario
last I checked  white is a color... we re all  people of color .
hI  me again
do these people not realize just how blatantly they re displaying their anti-whiteism
when are the woke going to start protesting the lack of white representation in bollywood productions
people complaining a white actor playing an italian plumber  created and intellectually owned by a japanese company....
john needs to just stop.....Imean...he played an italian john is columbian  ha!  and he is bitching about this      im honduran and dont care who plays in the mario movie. thats what actors do  play someone who they are not. hell  jennifer lopez  who is a puerto rican  played selena  who is a tejana  where was the backlash with that  humans really amaze me.
latinx have nothing to do with the sorcematerial  just italians
so unless youre portraying someone who looks exactly like you or is your exact ethnic background   isnt all acting appropriating   geez people calm the f down.
kinda wonder if they would complain if a black guy played mario. I bet you no e of those idiots would dare to complain xd or risk the backlash.. it disgust and saddens me.. with how people are nowadays
italians are white    this came as a great shock to me!
but  mario is white and you know they dont like people to voice characters that dont match in skin color. just look at the simpsons! they just playing by the woke rules now.
mario is italian  italians are latin people.  they should have gotten an italian american actor to play him
you all have definitely not seen the original movie. it was hot trash. my problem with the remake  with me being a native new yorker  is that chris pratt has a terrible brooklyn accent. bob hoskins  new york accent was pretty good.
since when did italians become non white  I am sure my relatives from lombardy with blond hair will be shocked to know they are not white.
u do kno italians aren t caucasian and u do kno he is italian so much wrong with this video
italians are white lol. white is a color.
italian are white european. so not sure why people are pissed about a white guy playing a white guy.
never heard this chick say anything positive
italians are not white  Im confused
this film will be great because the main voice actor is white . top gun 2  the joker etc billion dollar movies. white leads. I dont make the rules
oh my fucking God  one  mario is italian-american  a race mund you that is white  on top of that  luigI is his twin brother  and 2 has he played any . any  mario game
I dont want to hear it the woke can shove it. this is the stuff I hate about the woke hypocrisy. they did just make ariel black right. but thats ok huh
lmfao! its so ridiculous you have to make a video about it. fyI  none of us hispanics latinos are claiming this guy  leguizamo  just like we ll never claim  latinx .
cause stuff is always negative with all the political bs shoved into entertainment
guy who think he want to fight racism want people to hire base on race.....yeah....sure...
forget the fact the voice of mario is kinda cringe worthy  nah. gotta complain about the lack of diversity on the mario movie.
a italian plumber with italian accent cant be white - italy mostly white but slightly dark skin at least if you are gonna complain about diversity at least make it have sone reasonable sense or be historically accurate
I get that chris pratt s mario could use a little more...salamI in his voice  but who cares that they cast a white guy to voice a cgI character ! this type of stuff always makes me cringe. if you could see the real-life actor perform  it d be one thing  but its a cgI chubby plumper jumping on giant mushrooms! who cares what ethnicity the person voicing him is
super mario bros 1992 is awful. they likely want nothing to do with the 1992 film. and mario isn t even italian  he s japanese lol
how could we let this happen  didn t we already struggle to ruin apu s image in modern culture  when will these white supremacists learn to leave our colored characters alone !  xd
considering they were racially insensitive and left mario as a white italian american  I probably wont watch this
aren t italian s white tho-  they have peach skin and live in europe....is that not what a white person is anymore
how dare they not hire a black female trans-alien to play mario
hbd
aren t italians white
by the way  latins are white...
mario should be black  bisexual  non-binary  trans woman  transabled  plumber in rl. enough of the whiteness of hollywood. we need 500  representation  not just actors.
also mario is white. always has been. deal with it  paisano leguizamo
so... italians are white who would have though that europeans are mostly white !
he s one of the least talented actors of all time. I bet no one can name one movie that was made better because he was in it. he s been a detriment to every project... ok rant over lol happy birthday melonie!! boom!
john played a white guy  isn t that cultural appropriation
ummm...italians are white...
breaking  soon  hollywood will run out of black  trans women non-binary  gay bisezuals.
you sound cute when you say racist stuff
he seemed alright as bruno in encanto. also he s sid the sloth from ice age
@jake wulgar  I have to admit not seeing encanto yet. I hated the character of sid  but thats my opinion as someone not a big fan of that movie in general so take it with a grain of salt lol
italians are white...
when did john become an unhinged leftist
isn t mario italian  italian is white and has been considered white for decades now. mario is not from central or south america. trying to brown wash an italian man in a japanese creation. he sounds very culturally sensitive.
yes  how dare a character that has always had white skin continue to be portrayed with white skin.... sigh...
ummm  italians are white.
most latinos are white. latino refers to latin based languages from europe. hispanic refers to people from the iberian peninsula in europe  aka white people.
a white guy plays a white guy - d-list latino  actor  outraged!at some point this anti-caucasian thing will bite hollywood in the ass.happy b-day mel
who cares he always been white
remember when he was in that horrible rendition of super mario brothers   yeah.  they had bob hoskins as mario then. he s white. john leguizamo isn t exactly relevant anyway.
this isn t a live action movie.... does it even matter what color a voice actor is
no  that racist shit does not look anything like luigI  so that is not why they cast him. maybe he was blowing the right guy  but it wasn t his talent nor his resemblance.
so evil.. a white person playing an animated italian character. well hope you have an amazing birthday.
hey so pretty melonie  and your cool dogs  so we are in 2022  and people getting angry about mario bros voice a fiction character so stupid just lets cris prat  do his job. and stop being racist to everyone black  white or whatever people.
happy birthday.  and since when is mario not white    tell that to an italian plumber.  and john is not white and played luigi.  he s just trying to be relevant like not so silent bob. plus that movie sucked balls
who cares what a washed up actor from a movie thatsucked  and had nothing to do with the video game  thinks!
everyone in the movies should be black. everyone on tv and on the internet should be black. why aren t you black  why are there any white people anywhere  it doesnt make sense  because everyone is black  even white people are black. like george washington. and Jesus. even the color white  is actually black. except for chinese people in mexicans  they re black  but its okay to call them chinese or mexicans. oh and elvis and puppies are black too.
c llate  leguizamo  tu no hablas por todos los latinos. atentamente  un latino en nj.
someone spread the word to central and south americans...real italians are white.
there are millions of italians living in south america in fact way more than the usa  bet you didn t know that  and you think you need to tell them how italians look  trust me they know  there s entire countries and cities over there where most of the population came from italy. this john guy is not even a real latino  the dude is american  he s completely detached from latinos and the culture  very easy to tell by his use of  latinx . the dude was just salty they didn t cast him for the movie.
@aj  fun fact  millions of south americans are divorced from reality and assume they re real latinos when they re really indigenous   germanic   or african.and they all behave like leguizamo. because they came from x country or spoke x language   they assume they qualify to be a member of x ethnic group. frankly   I dont think most central or south americans are latino even though they speak a latin language. it is extremely nonsensical to jam different people into one box because of language they adopted.
