hollywood s disdain for the male audience reminds me of how kids in elementary school interact with their crushes. a lot of the time kids will make fun of their crushes and the kids they desire attention from because they dont have the social skills to just come out and say  I like you  give me attention.  when it comes to the mcu they need the male audience that buys comic books to sustain the current hollywood life blood of live action adaptations. they know that audience is willing to spend money on the action figures  paraphernalia  and anything related to the characters they have come to know and love. the problem is that audience doesnt like the bastardization of their favorite characters and properties. hollywood cant just admit they aren t giving the audience they desire what it wants  so they make fun of them  nag them  call them ists and phobes  all as a stunt to try and bait that audience into hate watching and or just simply paying attention to them.
remember the teachers thatsaid  I get paid whether you learn or not  ...yeah we hated those teachers too. same energy.
the fact that they have written stories attacking the fans and critics is especially telling of the gao s insane mindset because this was written and recorded long before the first clip was even seen by anyone  which means thatshe went into this hating the fans before anyone even complained
corporations are threatened by youtube streamers and commentators  Imean you are pretty threatening. tatted up and tank top. nah we dont need youtube streamers and commentators to tell us these shows are just trash. you are just the cherry on top in terms of entertainment. love what you do. we need to hit these people where it hurts  their wallets. itsure helps though we have people like you  the quartering and more who kicks them off their high horse and remind them who they supposed to appease to.
the lack of empathy from the people on this show  and general lack of care  irritates me. they are pissing on the fans without even the courtesy of calling  it rain.
she should care because she s portrayed as a superhero in a well known franchise. these characters are used as mediums for everyday people to find inspiration motivation to not let our flaws stop us from doing incredible things.
its crap but its the leggiest show out there.  the dishonest thing about jamil s tweets is her pretense that women aren t critical of the show.
this is exactly what a scam artist would say if you told them that their product didn t work.
imagine not caring about a show that could potentially give you more future earnings
hollywood  hates men and insults men also hollywood  why did men not go see this movie show
good commentary  as always melonie! as an actor myself  Ive often had to accept thatsome series or movies Ive been in are not good  or that the scripts suck. but I take those jobs because I need to pay my dues  Im not a known actor who gets rained on with scripts and when someone has asked me privately Ive admitted it. luckily Ive never had to do press interviews. I dont know if I d be able to put on a good face and lie. in all my jobs  including the ones thatsuck  Ive always been lucky enough to enjoy the shoot  have a great time  laugh a lot and meet great colleagues  both in the artistic and technical team. the final quality of the product has nothing to do with my personal experience shooting it. if someone tells me that they dont like my film or my series  I have no problem accepting it. for me its been a positive experience and thats what I value the most. that  and the pay if its good hahahaha!but what I would never  ever do would be to attack fans of a character or a story like the she-hulk or rings of power  actors do. ever. thats why I partly  and Imean partly  agree with jameela jamil s comment when she says who cares  she has her paycheck and hangs out with marvel actors. well  thats fine. good for her. but I dont understand and totally reject the arrogance and mind blindness of the rest of her tweet. I liked jameela jamil in the good place. I think she was the best thing about thatseries. and I saw her in a couple of personal interviews  one of them very interesting with russell brand in which she talked about her physical and mental problems. very interesting. thats why itshocks the hell out of me thatshe expresses herself that way. I think this whole religious movement of wokism  as you rightly call it  has brought out a part of her personality that I didn t see before. and I dont like it.thank you  melonie  for watching the series so I dont have to. my mental health thanks you!
the thing I really notice about how this show and rop are going over is that various other complaints aside  a key criticism is that the writing is bad but no one associated with the production has offered any pushback whatsoever to the effect of  actually the writing is good because x  y  and z.  and given they ve confessed they dont know how to write courtroom drama  its hard to see how a show about a lawyer could be well-written. so  what canthey say   its the fans! thats the real problem.
I have insider information. my brother worked for background and met two people who worked on the set of she hulk. the said that the actress kept getting into arguments with the staff and the director and just wanted to go home. not putting the blame on her though. she might be just caught in a web of frustrating crew members.
they re trying to make you and the crew the villains for wanting an entertaining show thats more faithful to the comic books  its like these people live in bizzaro world...good grief.
goes to show the people involved in creating whatever these atrocities are dont care about the fans or the original characters. they literally hate the fans!
great video melonie. always good to see cole train pop in. this situation isn t as bad as frosk but its not gonna help the m-she-u at all. it just seems so narcissistic.
she hulk is ridiculous. she hulk from the comics was actually fun. for a second there I thought you were going to say let me move my fat head but you dont have a fat head at all. that makes sense about the villian s . its so funny she replied to jeremy from geek   gamers. head slap moment with what that woman is saying on twitter. hey its cole train  he s so cool. great video. take care melonie. say hey to your folks.
for me this just shows how little pride they have in the work they put out as actors and that is just embarrassing
its starting to get to the point where being apart of marvel or dc isn t really worth it anymore if you dont care about the story good or bad.
I want disney to do what they canto get the 70 s incredible hulk series to plus so we can have a good live action hulk series to watch. I went back to the animated series to cleanse she-hulk out of my brain. thank you for your vids you are awesome and so is your content. keep up the great work.
so that no audience at all is left  how stupid
thats because hollywood is just plain trash at least now it is however they have managed to make some pretty good movies one of them being the new top gun movie that movie was beast it was better than the first one

they appear to validate themselves over the attention  negative or otherwise.makes me wonder if it ll be the end of them once complete audience apathy sets in  and creators stop making content off of them.then when numbers are low  they ll stir up drama about the -isms and people will take the bait and the cycle will start anew.
completely agree with what you said. well put.
ssj4 s goated in dokkan
@michael coulter  top gun maverick wasn t thought up or made by current day hollywood  that was 100  tom cruise s doing. tom cruise is one of the only a listers thatseems to understand audiences want good quality movies  not movies with agendas  woke bullshit  re-writing of history  race swapping to pander  or just flat out terrible lazy cash grabs. he made a movie with a simple plot  just the right amount of nostalgia from the first movie  didn t make the female pilot shit on her male counterparts  didn t make the male pilots gang up on and berate or degrade the female pilot  and most of all he thanked the fans. his message that played at some of the early screenings seemed genuine  and it truly felt like he was expressing a level of appreciation towards the people going to the theatre to watch his movies. you simply dont see that today from big stars.
I wouldn t know  I was homeschooled. my teacher didn t get paid!
@bethany johnson  Im so sorry
@bethany johnson  your homeschooled teacher did get paid.
what she doesnt seem to realize is that the sentiment can go both ways. you dont care about putting in your best effort for a production  alright then  then I wont care to see your involvement in any other project.  plenty of other shows with better actors to choose from.   youre an entertainer  you need an audience to make a living.  we re not obligated to give you our time or money.  so I wouldn t be so quick to handwave away negative criticisms. sure  you ll get paid for this gig. but when the suits catch on that your shitty attitude and performance doesnt get asses in seats. youre going to get a lot of doors slammed in your face.
how is it the same energy  its a job its an acting career. if people dont like the show they have the choice to watch something else
@tony kun  dumb dumb thats what everybody did omg .
@mandz  unfortunately there s so many people out there who just consume product that they ll always have a somewhat sustainable business model with this content factory that disney has created. eventually they ll have to slow down and go back to making quality over quantity  but its going to take years  maybe even another decade to get there.
@x   return2monke
yeah I d honestly wish people would just stop reporting it and giving them the attention. the trailer sucked  and the initial episode sucked thats all we need to know. its like a he man situation. we get an amazing trailer  but the show is a 180  dont watch. thanks for saving me the time  now let s forget this thing exists so the project can fail and maybe we can get something better down the line. even bad publicity is still publicity. batwoman probably would have never got a second season if people didn t hate watch the entire first one. I agree with everyone that has these shows but youre getting played if you have to make more than two on the same exact show.
I slightly disagree. I believe they think that you and I will continue to support them no matter what because we are the fandom. they are risking pissing us off to get another 2 percent of the population to like them. stepping over dollars to pick up pennies as it were. they count on us to keep coming back if they offend us in a minor way. kind of like the gay kissing scene in the eternals..... yea  I could move past it.... but I wasn t going to show my 10 year old nephew that. I really dont like sex being in my hero flix to begin with  whether straight or gay. 30 years ago  that movie would have been rated r... but they want this stuff pushed on kids  so the ratings folk just slide it through. I have friends that just dont care and keep buying whatever trash disney wants to push.... that lower case d was on purpose. the fans need to step back a bit. sample the content at the theatre and only show the younger folk the good stuff. we may at some point just need to walk away. we vote with our dollars. if we keep giving them money at the same levels as say.... avengers...... they will keep going woke. we need to let them know they are on the right track through financial hardship... otherwise  we need to explain to the youngsters why 2 men are kissing..... or what the 2 naked eternals are doing behind that boulder. I dont want this. the kids dont want this.... if disney wants to trade our support for the alphabet folk  I say we let them. we turn our backs  and this will stop. we collectively give them billions of dollars of support. let them trade that for the  200 000 the alphabet folk will give them. then its game over.
@michael coulter  I still I gotta watch both topgun movies
the sad thing is that type of attitude in hindsight was toxic as hell. yes we re kids we barely know how to read and count. so our social skills aren t there yet adults pulling that mess off is so tacky  a promotes the chain the never break since people are gonna see being toxic is fine.
@jason garcia  me too
I would rather watch hollywood burn to the ground. that is entertainment.
I like watching these critical reviews of these garbage shows. its the only attention this garbage gets from me. this crap gets zero dollars from me. if everyone that hates this shit refused to support it  it would be done and over.
that
well  marvel also kind of despises their male audience now  too! this is a joke!
thats a good way to describe what s happening.
@rex young  I agree  but itseems like they initially target the fandom with a logo flash or some kind of hype announcement because they know the fandom will start the hype train and it will trickle down to the sheep. then everyone goes to the theatre or pays the streaming fee  but by then its too late  they ve already got the money. after that the fandom makes videos and becomes loud about how awful movie show x was and it generates clicks  watch time on youtube  and brings eyeballs to the shit they put out. like the old saying goes   any publicity is good publicity.  I whole heartedly agree that walking away is the only option right now. that will force them to pivot toward quality  or they will sink. and yes  hollywood  the woke mob  the alphabet community  and many other niche groups are pushing way too many things on kids at an alarming rate  and they re steadily pushing them on younger and younger kids. Im not hyper conservative  but I do believe that kids needs to be kids  and there used to be age appropriate content for a reason. the lines have been blurred by ratings boards. my running theory  and I hate to be this vulgar  is that the niche communities  alphabet for example  have such a low population and pool of people to sleep with that the easiest way to increase the size of their pool is to push their life style on the youth so that they become part of the pool. its disgusting to think about  but what other explanation is there
dokkan fan in the wild
@plab  what
@plab  another man of culture I take it
@j viz  ofc I play the hit mobile game dragon ball z dokkan battle. ready for gamma 1 and 2
@taesire jasper  youre not in the top 1  sorry you wouldn t get it
@plab  . idk about the gammas. Im sure they ll be good together  and thats what worries me. they re androids  but they most likely wont work with other androids like agl cell  teq 17 18  etc because they will have  shitty links like signature pose and heroes of justice. lr golden frieza is my  1 most wanted unit on global  he ll slot in nicely next to my rainbow lr ffc. fsgg is a close second. if the heroes units are lb monkes they ll take priority though.
@j viz  oh u one of the dokkan fans with a brain thats a surprise. no yea thats true ab the gammas. I was also waiting for golden frieza for coolers team  best team ever btw I no itemd almost every red zone stage with it  but now hes not gonna drop for a while probably which sucks. heroes is probably gonna be ssj4 lb yea  and are probably gonna be nuts. every year Ive spent stones on heroes and those units fall off so quickly. really hoping these batch of heroes units will be red zone ready. also very hyped for thatssj4 vegito eza  his base kit is really good  double support and super counter.
@plab  I dont follow the truth 3 dodge on every unit train of thought and I dont summon for every df that releases. I buy all the sale stones  hold them  and only summon on the big 3 banners of the year for top tier units. I have 95  of all dokkanfest turs and lrs rainbowed from doing that. not sure how the carnival banners are going to change my summoning habits because I skip yellow coin banners most of the time. in special cases like golden frieza or fused zamasu I ll drop   1k before calling it. I usually skip the heroes banner for the exact reason you said  but I went crazy on the ss4 vegito banner because int ss4 gogeta was running the game at that time. best case scenario this year is they drop lb ss4 vegito as the first heroes lr  or maybe a dual lb ss4 with an active into vegito. since we got 2 gogeta s for year 7 Im guessing year 8 will be double vegito.
@plab  drop your fc in here and I ll add you
couldn t have put it better myself.
you mean melonie doesnt haunt your nightmares like some kind of urban legend
@Godofplague  oh I did not say that. in fact. there are some nights where I dream she s screaming at me  if you dont eat your meat  you cant have any pudding!  dx
shit  I respect that.  show sucks but hey  you get your bag. welcome to capitalism  its the american way
@majora  good news is  I am only reading the synopsis of each episode and watching clips on youtube  if I actually watched the show  I would get a migraine  I will just wait till the daredevil episode and give them 1 view on disney plus. lol!
@creatv  pirate it lol
@bryan lara  a fellow man of culture I see.
@majora  capitalism like every other system has pros and cons  to act like capitalism is this absolute bad that can be blamed for everything  even when its the human aspect that causes the con is crazy.
pissing  on the fans  I like the show quite a bit. if you dont thats fine  but why is that  pissing  on you  I dont like 99.9  of tv shows  doesnt mean the creators are disrespecting me for daring to make something I dont want to watch.  how pathetic and shameless do you have to be to publicly whine about this kind of thing
many she-hulk fans  comic readers  expected a show that honored the comics and the character  they did not get that. people are allowed to express their disdain for a show  just as you can complain about my opinion.
@creatv  people who like this  weather they truly do or not  need to understand they re an extreme minority  and that marvel will have to pivot away from this crap if they like money.
some guys pay extra for that kind of action cotton.
thats an interesting metaphor
@brian ward  youreally meat eating this to the grave huh  then not only that your questions to something the guy pretty much already answered and he definitely isn t wrong.
well in this case she is the villain of the show so itseems fitting after all
really good point and thats probably the biggest reason this is happening. the agenda is about not giving people a reason to persevere. instead they should be victims and dependent on the system.
why would she care about everyday normal people
did you watch the show  she s the villian
@gotblade  it doesnt that corrupt politicians and their allies want people to be dependent on them at all costs.
I think its intentionally wack just like almost everything else in current year because loosh is more valuable than money  and pissing people off makes loosh.
chances are she knows thatstuff  she just doesnt care about actually inspiring or motivating people. most of these types just like the perception that they do rather than putting in the actual work.
she s straight up a hulk lawyer in the comic book as well. Im not sure how you can make that at all the most interesting to watch
they always pretend that to be honest.
and the ones who are critical are called  pick-mes  or have some  internalized  issues against women.
@nabinut  thats honestly 60  of modern women today
its an obvious sour grapes situation. she is angy about it but tries to hide it
honestly what could she have done  shes not a editor or director.... if the end product ends up being dogshitshe cant stress over dogshit  only thing she should care about is her future prospects. thats it   even if she cared about being she-hulk  her acting would nt have change the awfulness she hulk is
gotta keep that high esg score lol.
@niles  same like many critics do praise her for trying to work with the awful script and know she can do better.  yeah any actor cant be totally honest about a show until years from now when its behind theme.
good points.
I wonder  do you think this might have been a tweet drafted by the company in one of those  sign over access to your social media for our pr line  deals or do you think it was an organic response
@lawofimprobability  I dont know. I hope is the first  but Im afraid its her. it could be fifty fifty.
@lawofimprobability  no. its just her taking the liberty allowed by the show s anti-troll tactics. they cant dispute anything she says or they expose themselves
Ive got a lot more respect for actors who come out and say things like   I dont know if its going to be good. the production was a mess while I was there  and Ive got no input on the editing process.  that kind of honesty not only sets expectations  but also opens up the possibility of it becoming a cult classic years later. crappy movies can actually become really famous this way  when there s stories like   the lead actors didn t even want to attend the premiere. and sometimes  if youre a really good actor  you might get   that actor was way too talented to belong in this movie. they put on such a performance in every scene they re in  it only highlights just how bad all the rest of it is.
exactly...regardless of how we feel about the show  or writing - its practically unbelievable that behind the scenes for she-hulk was half as competent as orphan black  etc.
I have a feeling there s gonna be a documentary about the  disney plus rush  after all the hype has died down.
itsounds like her portrayal as a problem extends to real life.
not surprising. actors sometimes have to sign over the access to their social media accounts to the company so taking any of those posts seriously is risky.
I was an extra in a film with some actors that most people would know pretty well  and found that the process of making a film can be a bit tense at times. the actors cool down a bit and move on and the tension cant be found in the final scenes once they are edited  except for some fillms where you can actually see problems that got past editing  all in all  acting is stressful sometimes. my guess is she hulk is not this actress  favorite role. at least as soon as she figured out that it was going to look terrible and be poorly received.
honestly I d cry complain and wanna go home if I was on the set of this shitshow as well
what  actress  are youreferring to exactly
@iro  bro no way
@jimbo bimbo  probably tatiana maslany who plays jennifer walters she-hulk.
the executives and their allies are the actual villains to be honest.
@turok duels   probably   well the video is not talking about maslany. so youre just guessing around and accusing people based on that
@turok duels  well thats not who the video is talking about.
@jimbo bimbo  why dont you calm down there jimbo
@bigplayquay  calm down  stop asking the right questions you mean
@jimbo bimbo  found tatiana maslanys burner account
very interesting.
cole trains bigger than melonie!
try the isom comic. young rippa has good comics soo far.
werewolf by night was good. shame it was not a series. man-thing was funny without trying too hard and had a good chemistry with elsa and jack. they even used the agent from fraiser as a villain and she did a good job. she-hulk could have great.
most of the 70s hulk is on tubi.
wasn t the  70s hulk show made by universal
@charles philip adams  yes it was.
she-hulk is so disappointing because of what it could have been.  when I first heard about it  a lot went through my head.  first reaction was  thats a joke  right    then  oh  its real  who is this for    and finally  holy crap it actually sounds awesome.  its for me!   I later found out that I was right the first time.  I love a good juxtaposition  and the idea of a hulk character being in that kind of environment could lead to many interesting situations.  I never read the comics  obviously  so I didn t know it was actually a thing  but if they had gone a different direction with it  Imay have stan d for it.  however  everything jameela jamil touches is worse off for it.
once she-hulk has finished its run no one will ever talk about it again. personally  I would have tried to make a more timeless show so people would still be able to enjoy it 50  years later.
hearing thatshe doesnt care and just wanted the bag is comforting for some reason lol
shes going out in rage because she realizes this is the only a grade commission of direction she will ever get
in my mind  it is never the fault of the actors. it is always the fault of the show runners and studio.
the batman was good.  woke  doesnt mean its bad especially when you use moderation like they did.
I never watched an episode about she-hulk. when I heard about people mad about her twerking  I fell out laughing  lmao
what s wrong with modern women   points to jameela jamil
she did her job just like anyone else would
how deep did they have to dig to find an article that placed them  1  are they not told how their show is really doing  are they just told  youre  smart  beautiful and doing a great job. you go girl boss!  haha
I liked that in the recent episode  she-hulk was toxic in a room full of supportive men in a reverse of the perceived response to the show.
okay so I dont think anyone has pointed this out  and Im quite new to your channel  and I cant help but notice that you just press play and go. like you dont cut every 5 seconds and the entire video isn t a clip of edits. just goes to show how good of communicating your view and public speaking in general. subscribed
she also admits she doesnt like the show either but she has to obey orders from feige man and disney to keep promoting the show..
I used to have a crush on melonie years ago during league days  then kinda lost track of the whole entertainment scene for a while but Im glad Im back  not to have a crush on melonie again but to truly admire the kind of person she s evolved into. much respect.
I worked in a office full of women 5 years ago and I routinely would hear them when they thought I had my headphones turned on walking around being a handyman for the building all their gossip and I had never been more disgusted how the whole floor was single but had 3 to 4 kids and they wouldn t take a promotion cuz it would mean they got less money from child support. finally the owner brought it up why nobody wanted the promotion I go it was one lady put this in all their head and all of them are getting child support  but they were always after men way out of their league and believed they weren t vs working in a shop full of guys the guys would joke every women was out of everybodys league. I am not shocked by anything a women says about men now after working there.
I honestly really wanted to like this series going into it. I was a fan of the late 80 s early 90 s portrayal of the character.
if thats what she thinks and had kept it to herself then fine  there are plenty of people that have been involved in genre entertainment and either hated it or just saw it as a paycheck. its when you let the mask slip in public that the trouble begins.
titania  cynical postscoltrane  starts making hairball in background
the real villain was the friends we made along the way.
which is hilarious because she s admitting thatshe knows itsucks.
I started reading the she hulk comic books because of the show and so far its pretty accurate in the comic books which is interesting. she s an actual lawyer in the books and she got into a street fight with titania in the books as well to be fair I am reading the recent chapters of she hulk
they claim it is based on sensational she-hulk which it is not. in those comics  she goes to space and saves a restaurant from being attacked so the owners gave her a flying car that operates like a spaceship  not whatever thatstuff was in fast and furious  but it gets destroyed after three years after the comic debut. she does a lot of cool stuff in the comics and seems a lot nicer and less mean spirited. she is a lawyer in every comic just like daredevil. she has better fights with titania in the comics. they could have done great things with the 4th wall aspect but unfortunately it is just her glaring at the audience and pulling faces. they do a lot better with deadpool s version of the 4th wall  yet she-hulk was created first. they tried to make the show meta by using she-hulk to attack any criticism that may occur. it feels like they do purposely do stuff to annoy their audience such as skaar. they know people wanted planet hulk related stuff  so they made his son look silly  useless and has a toupee looking thing on his head. the ones who defend the show will claim Im sexist or wanted the show to fail but how canthat be if I own the comics  like her appearances in the animated shows  I wanted to like the show  but the episodes feel like they are only ten minutes long which is not long enough for anything to occur. I was looking forward to a she-hulk and abomination team up
twilight zone  star trek  original star wars  wild wild west  mission impossible  captain scarlet  dr. who-- television shows nearing fifty  at or over fifty  that people enjoy to this day.  it can be done  however  I suspect she-hulk tv series will only make it to fifty years in the sense that fifty years from now  it will be as an example of what not to do.
@lunar exploration 1889  to be fair. people will be saying the same thing about the 13th doctor.
@lunar exploration 1889  detective conan
the old she-hulk animated series seems decent. she was good in all the animated stuff like fantastic four and incredible hulk. she was a lot nicer unless provoked. in the hulk series  she gets kidnapped and ends up being injected with bruce s blood and she actually likes the power and uses it. she does not cry about having cool powers.
@nemesis the slasher   being fair here though. her problem in the disney  show wasn t  the cool powers . but thatshe didn t want them to get in the way of her civilian life. or being stuck in an island away from civilization because of them.by the first episode she is already fine with having powers.show still not good. but lets actually shit on it correctly.
@chaos-15  I agree but she never really had much of a life. she-hulk gave her an actual purpose. I just feel likee she is a miserable person which is never explained. she has a great family  a good career and friends. her cousin had a tougher life such as child abuse  trying to control his alterego from not hurting people. etc. she-hulk was a much more likeable person in the animated stuff and comics.
agreed!
lmao it was a post creditscene. it was meant to be funny and not taken seriously
I liked that episode as well. learned a lot of good lessons from it even when dealing with my own issues. take the time for yourself every once in a while and cut out those that are bad for you
for someone who starred in the good place  I have a feeling she s heading down to the bad place.
@zoloft77  wished she would have never been cast in the show..
omg
rofl!!!
marvel studios  kevin feige .they really dropped the ball with who they brought on for this project as well as the pr thats happening. one of the biggest problems I saw with she-hulk is not just the story not really doing much in terms of being a part of a bigger world universe  but its also the fact that jen s story is not really a personal story that people could relate to  but more so a narrative to supposedly help women feel like  I have to stand up to this man s world! I am strong and have to combat the narrative!  but it doesnt do any of this. it feels like kne big rip-off.
in a world in which women make themselves into content this girl actually provides real content.
everything you showed us here today smells like copium. actors lashing out at fans and critics never works well. they really need to reign in their egos because it always reflects badly on them  the studios and their careers.
you should do a group show with vara dark  her takes on things are also on point.
jameela s mother  hey hun  I watched your show last week.  it was number one in my book.jameela tweets  we had the number one show last week.everybody else who has ever seen the show
did she not watch your video yesterday ! ! actors and actresses are doing a great job of tanking their own shows.
props to she-hulk  rop and other  woke  shows for giving me more and more awesome yt content creators like gundam  drinker  sydney wathson and you  and more and more . I dont think I would bump on you guys without this massive backlash for this shitty shows.
real people out here in the real world know that these people dont give a damn once you pay them the money they they will pay and put a pop whatever good show and good characters you want them to poo poo up they dont care not even a little bit and thats the problem because real fans and people out here that care about these characters
tatiana is a fine actress  I think she has proven herself in some difficult roles.  this show s directors  writers  etc are all the worst.  I bet she signed on long before they had a pilot outlined  disney has this reputation now that gets them good actors who sign on w o any idea wtf the project will be.
how to say  noone else hire me for another show  without saying it.
Im sure disney investors also dont care about how well the show is doing as long as she had fun.
wow  that  dude  who cares   tweet is tough to stomach. I didn t care about the show at all  but for someone who actually worked on it to say so and to add such a cynical take like  at least I got paid and met celebrities  really shows the mind set of the majority of these productions now. its a perfect microcosm and why all these movies and tv shows seem to be slipping more and more into crap.
I remember when family matters and mr. belvedere were the  1.... but like all shows there is always more
yes a new melonie video. Im here for it
she s happy thatshe got paid for the show but this kinda behavior is gonna make that a lot harder in the future
melonie you ve lived long enough to become the villain.  congrats on staring in the show low key!
support people like eric july  the rippaverse and the rest of the fellowship on youtube.   eric cares and wants your business.   new dc stuff and m-she-u are only good for laughing at how bad they currently are with some exceptions.
if her entire opinion was  I dont care I got my paycheck  and then she left it at that  based af but if course she cant leave it at just that
the princess bride. fun for all. why  because its so damn good. even the kissing parts aren t so bad.
I thank people like you for taking the sacrifice to watch this sh t show to give us an amusing review as well as rants.
forreal  ngl I would have respected that
found you on youtube then migrated to your twitch I have too say you with curley hair looks much better and more fun and also frames you face better then when you had straight hair. I also love the content lol
honestly wasnt expecting a video today! youre on a roll melonie!
cant blame her I would feel the same way its not like its her project she just an employee for a business... she s not the writer  producer  director just someone to read off a paper and call it a day.
remember  for most actors  probably all  any movie or show is just another job.  certainly  that is the attitude of the people behind the camera  the regular workers. talked with some of them over the years.
so yha with 2 episodes left this show didn t have a goal in mind or tell us what was happening it just felt random I thought at least episode 5 will do it but nope so Im hoping the next 2 episode will really tell us what the main plot is and why sometimes doing a tv show is not always a good idea. specially when you dont need no ads either or wait for other episodes to come on.
hahaha I was just watching a quartering video about this. now I get to see one of my other favorite youtubers  take on it. its been a good day.
melonie youre absolutely right! just watch out as they call a self hating or claiming you have internalized sexism or some other bullshit  dont let it get to you!
I dont know if its doing well or not I just know itsucks  rofl!!!
honestly I respect that. as an actress its not her job for the product to be good.
well  I figured this is what they think already  but at least they re being honest about it now.
hey melonie  great video! love your content but recently I have noticed you stopped doing Bible stuff afterwords which I am kind of sad about honestly. I loved those segments because you would talk about a situation then go to the Bible to see what itsaid on the topic. honestly that was the main reason I initially subbed to your channel because that aspect was very unique and no one else was really doing that from my knowledge. I just wanted to share my thoughts on this and hope you are doing well.
the villain is the audience!  talk about breaking the fourth wall on a whole new level!
my new motto   go boom! not woke or broke!  the more I watch this channel  the more I really enjoy it.
I watch what looks good. mainly action n comedy movies. laughter is the best medicine go mel
bro its crazy how you still make videos. I think I was watching you when I was like 13 and then a few years after. Im 24 now watching again. I think the last video I saw was you moving into a new apartment in like 2014 or something.
pretty sure she doesnt care if the good is good or bad since she s done paid. for most actors just use these types of shows because its merely just a stepping stone for other work.
first time viewing. appreciate the clean content and the mentioning of your faith. keep up the work!
she hulk s biggest villian was her narcissism.. which she typically showed when she busted thru the mcu menu and told kevin how to run the show..  I get she did that in the comics  but she was also a fun character in the comics too than a whiny character that took no accountability
Im not even gonna finish this show  couldn t get past the 3rd or 4th episode. I ll just watch the one daredevil shows up  if he actually does lol  and thats it. wong and madisynn with 2 n s and 1 y were the best part of this show so far
Imean part of me understands that to a degree. if I was a actor in a show and being paid well I would not really care to much if the show is bad or bombs because I got my money and I am not responsible for bad writing etc. I would not insult fans and so on due that being a bad look and just seems petty.
thank you so much  I appreciate that
yup true
@melonie mac go boom  lol. I live in los angeles. met some actors. what can I say  they re a bit off.
exactly. its up to the writing  producer not the actor  actress to make it good.
I feel that anybody in the work force should being working for the customer or client. its not wrong to work for yourself  but when you dont give a crud about the people who but your product  your product and your pr usually suffers. care about the people who fill pockets and they will care about you.
keep being awesome mels!
Imean she doesnt write the show lmao she just reads the lines
her name is forever tied to something the promotes being hateful and spiteful to the opposite sex. the fact thatshe looked at the script and still did it already spoke volumes to me. never would have thought that 1  she was ever a marvel fan the way she dismantled and destroyed a chance to protray an interesting and originally decently written character 2  would double down.
idkw but if tatiana  if she hasn t already  comes out and attacks fans Im gonna be sad  she seems like a decent person
yeah saw the first episode and stopped halfway into it maybe a little over half and decided that was it for me
black widow  wasp  gamora  nebula  captain marvel  yelana  mystique  jean grey  storm  rogue...awesome female leads co-stars that are done  for the most part  well and dont push anything on anyone and just simply hold their own with everyone else and goes with the flow.  need I say more
this is going on in every industry across the board... the entire hollywood industry  oil industry  etc... short term gains... its as if everyone knows this shit ain t gonna last much longer no matter what  so they take what they can now  and dont give a shit if they screw up so bad they ll never get hired again... and aren t even attempting to think long term.
its like a cannibal saying she enjoyed their baby leg sandwich and wont change her appetite.
I guess she doesnt know that if something isn t good  you wont get good money
a show that breaks the fourth wall so hard that the villain is the viewer. they tailor made it to offend a certain chunk of the marvel fandom  then they shamed and bullied that portion of the fandom for having a negative reaction.
I usually take it as a sign of weakness whenever they stoop to that level if its uncalled for.
personally  I want ever watch anything else she is in.
the villain of the series is obviously the plot...and they are doing amazing at beating the crap out of it.
ofcourse she doesnt care  we can already tell
movies and tv shows have always been  woke.   the difference now is they rub your face in it.  it used to be about telling a story  and having the social stuff playing out in the background.
call me crazy but I found that comment somewhat refreshing.  sounded like she knows the show is crap and doesnt try to defend it or insult everyone that doesnt like it  she just says  eh  its a job  and thats that.  the lack of respect for the audience or source material isn t her doing.
jessica gao is just a variant of madama gso from daredevil
I do think they could have made a much better she hulk series  think they made it too slapstick and as you say woke even if I dont care too much about that in general  but when meaningful content is missing or lacking then its bad. I think they could have made it more interesting than filming me going to pickup my groceries.
jameela   we didn t stick to any formula yes you did.  you stuck to  the message .
wanda
then people get mad at her for not giving her opinion on the show like what she was supposed to do to make the writing better
its like going to a restaurant and the chef doesnt give a crap.  some people take pride in their work some dont care
all I can say is thank God for house of the dragon and american gigolo
she-hulk is happy as long as she gets her green!
love you melonie and its good to see your cat in background
her tweets were generally playful. jeremy from g g even gave her credit for engaging disgruntled fans. this isn t the controversy youre looking for.
its not the studio thats putting you in there its the writers  itseems like the studio doesnt have much to do with this series
I have never seen the film  but by all accounts it was terrible. however I have seen the house that it built  and it is terrific.
thats how she s going to end her career but thats fine  she got paid by disney that one time
as near as I can figure  the target audience for she-hulk seems to be  not you!
honestly  they should ve gotten dick wolf or one of the other law   order writers to work on she hulk.
the show is definitely something  I cant say I havent enjoyed some aspects like emil or the d list comic characters. but seeing how its mainly just repeat same words type deal. I get that its most likely setting up captain america 4  but it could ve been done so much better. I like marvel and I want to enjoy what they put out  but the artist strain and rushing is taking away from what made itspecial. the wokeness is noticeable in a lot of phase 4  but im hoping maybe werewolf by night will be better and a nice change
jamila   its made for the people this genre has forgotten all these years. toxic  divorced  wine-aunts
when I saw the title  she-hulk  attorney at law  I thought  finally they have a character that could rise. my thought was it would be law and order meets the hulk. they could have revisited the sokovia accords or take a look at legal questions around a post thanos universe  etc. instead  they are just using it as a vehicle to push a woke agenda. Im not completely against agendas in entertainment. charlie chapman in the great dictator  the movie schindler s list  heck even the matrix had some woke in it. however  the purpose should be to entertainment and captivate your audience  not chastise them.
she-hulk was literally one of my most wanted character to enter the mcu and this show disappointed me and made me feel targeted.
least surprising news ever. she must have read a script or gathered a bit of the vibe before accepting the role. she prolly knew it was not good before filming started.
wouldn t it be funny if the mr sandman on twitter was someone in a position of influence for the netflix show and by that twitter reply shot down a chance for a future project deal.
as for being  1 at one time the lost in space movie  the man in the iron mask with dI caprio and Godzilla 98 were all 1 at one time.. didn t mean they were good though.
I watched a clip of she hulk in 90s hulk animated series and thatshe hulk seems more interesting than the current one  plus cree summer aka kida s va voices she hulk
I could see one of her non-binary friends to convince her to put pronouns down so when we talk to people we acknowledge we were talking to which I dont know if it matters if you put it down or not but itshouldn t matter to the person that decides what they put down
she said the silent part out loud thats why all these actors participate money is their God Im not gonna lie I did enjoy orphan black but now that Ive dug deeper into my Christian faith I dont even watch shows like that anymore anyway God bless melonie stay blessed homie stay safe
let s be honest here. if youre an actor in marvel nowadays  youre not there for the art. youre there for the new addition its add to your house. and thats not really an unfair thing.let s be clear here. she wasn t insulting the fans as a whole. she was shooting back a a single person taking snipes. and it was fairly measured  especially when compared to to others like brie larson.
99  of actors would wish to be a main star in a mcu project. sure she plays a villian but gets plenty of screentime as part of the main cast
the fact thatshe doesnt care shows in her  performance.
being proud of being on this show is like being proud you built the titanic and saying   hey  I got my money  thinking it wont affect your career in the future
that is a well fed cat! he she it bicycle...  whatever pronouns the cat accepts  looks cute!
I wonder how people would react if someone decided to make hallmark romance movies for people who only like action movies  do you think the romance fans would mind all the changes
hey just recently had your channel suggested to me - watched a couple of your videos and they re growing on me - thank you for being based - hello from houston texan vietnamese and thats the extent of my bio-haa
little too much makeup but she s an absolutely beautiful young woman with good opinions. thats a great looking cat too
I really dont understand why when she-hulk made her dating profile not jennifer and she hooked up with the doctor  why was the doctor viewed as a bad guy when the next day she showed up as jennifer and he didn t want her  he wasn t attracted to jennifer  he was attracted to she-hulk. thats like you going out to a club  meeting a woman taking her back to your place and when you go to take her clothes off she s wearing a body suit  wig  and heels. in other words she s not what you were attracted to.
thumbs up for the cat at the end!
3 57 so Im seeing a lot of missing names from that list  one standout name thats missing is house of the dragon  is that not a us streaming show as for statistics its a well known fact that you have to look at the raw numbers because of how easy it is to twist them.
its sad because so many fans respected her when she first stood up for them. many of them must feel stabbed in the back.
thats a problem with society they dont care about the product they just want to get paid and big companies need to know that trolls and actual marvel fans are not the same
my brain is so fried with all the wokeness in everything. I legit cant take it anymore
thats what the cast of ghostbusters 2016 said too.
like a cross between brie larson and frosk not caring about coworkers and trying to be indifferent about not being liked. except she didn t have to do it on camera. none of the rest of us exist.
jameela jamil has never been known to take the high ground lol. she is deliberately antagonistic  she has an aggressive streak a mile wide. there is a vast difference between standing your ground and being abusive. jameela doesnt seem to have a clue about the distinction between holding your own and being an aggressive jerk.
only watching because I want to see charlie cox s portrayal of daredevil next two episodes
shouldn t taitania be in jail after assaulting jen in the second episode  its always been in the back of my head why she s roaming around freely after assaulting someone in court.
I appreciate the honesty.
she s definitely paid her fine and bale out being rich and such
never interfere with an enemy while its in the process of destroying itself.
remember deadpool  no no--Imean the x-men origins  wolverine  deadpool   remember how it awful it was  how it pissed off all the fans and how the depiction of him toward the end was regarded as farcical those fans were fortunate enough to have an actor and willing company that cared enough to have another crack at it. what followed was not only a far more honest and accurate portrayal of said character  to much success and praise. until recently  it was the highest grossing r-rated weekend debut. ever.this is not she she-hulk we were hoping for. she is not a thin-skinned radioactive wine-mom. but rather than to try and understand the mistakes  and make amends to the fandom that allows these people to even have a character to ruin in the first place  they  meaning her and the pr that run these official accounts.  run to twitter with all of the petty smug-c    energy a millennial karen can muster in order to  deflect  criticism from people that genuinely know and care more about said characters depiction.nevermind her kindergarten schoolyard   Im rich. youre not. lol.  retort.basically stating  its not made for the pre-existing fandom.  means its for no one. absolute genius take.
well  she is an actress  the people thatshould care are the producer  directors for example.
honestly from a working american standpoint I can relate fandoms are always gonna critique or over critique and people dont always got time for dat specially now we in mad recession..everyone needs to get paid
I admit the show not good but did like this episode cuz its so charming just wish the show be on the true she hulk from comics and cartoons hoping the next 2 episodes be good
there is no way on God s green earth thatshe hulk was viewed by more people than cobra kai. I will never in this lifetime believe that. cobra kaI and yellowstone are the top two shows out there  there s no way either of them gets beaten by a show no one is watching and everyone seems to hate.
I feel kinda sad for the guys that liked the death by snu-snu big women. and the big women that can give death by snu-snu. missed opportunity.
2 complete bombs in a row from marvel shows ms marvel  and she hulk...
acting isn t about entertaining other and having fun making movies anymore  its about getting paid.
down the road  she ll regret acting like that.
its for the people this genre forgot all those years  - what wine moms
I have a friend who works for a major network  he says the nielsen ratings are the ones they pay attention to most as they are the defacto-standard.
9 20 - the word you were looking for is petty. it was petty of her to say that.
great video as always mel
at least she s being honest I guess
tfw she-hulk been waiting years for her solo adaption and now the one we got is done by people who dislike the fans excited for that. hollywood is something else.
missing the wings but still amazing looking.
its for the people this genre forgot all these years maybe all those  forgotten people  should have turned out for black widow  ww1984 and thor  love and thunder  because their box office sucked
I like the show  its different. everything doesnt have to be end game level good. they introduced she hulk and took from the comic books... its solid entertainment.
they hate you. simple as that.
people expect her to make the show better somehow when its out of her power
yea but we dont want to watch pure garbage with our hard earn worked for money.
marvel has much better things in the rise..as far as she hulk I was never too invested in her character . as far as I know wongers was the best ep and if they dont include daredevil for finale then I will definitely judge this as donkey shit.. however  I do hear they are reviving all former netflix mcu from devil to punisher so pluses
end game was just decent  not good. now infinity war is good
@melonie mac go boom  ok  you got me. true... Imeant both as a whole. but I agree.
imagine a woman sobbing over her dead child  drowned in a public pool.jameela jamil  the lifeguard   I dont know what youre upset about. I had a great time. and other people seem to be enjoying themselves. what s your problem
if thats what she actually said surely they will be recasting the role of jen going forward.in a min thats the female bad guy thats made to look like a moron each time she shows up isn t it
when the actors and directors think their shows movies that they make is for them and not for the audience it truly shows. woke garbage aint for us
looks like we found our next new subject for the mystery index.
at least she s honest  I do have to give her that.
what kills me about a lot of these defenders of she hulk is that they act like women are not critical of the show. well I have seen videos of women even being more vicious towards the show than the men!as for her yelling  who cares  I got paid!  all I got to say to jamila is talk to me in about 5 to 10 years and let s see if you have thatsame energy when you cant find no work anywhere!
every time a member of the she-hulk cast speaks it reaffirms my choice to never consume the product. eventually it ll collapse  might not be this year  or next year  but eventually the climb ends and its all downhill.
shehulk  is a show
the hell you get that amazing honduran white bat  that is 100  quality
she hulk was the villain all along
imagine if workers in every field said this about their job  doctors not caring about doing a good job because they are getting paid anyway  engineers not caring if the building they made are safe because who cares they got paid  real estate agents not giving two shits about the awful house they just sold because they already got their commission. itsays a loot about her lack of professionalism and how she doesnt actually cares about being part of something good  shes just there to collect money. also gotta add that list must be fake af  to actually believe the awful winx show is in the top 10 yet house of the d is not even there....
imagine cats other pets not knowing about technology and seeing you talk to yourself. first thought I heard after seeing the cat hehe.
itshows the level of care that was taken in making this garbage show that one of the lead character actors is just in it for the bag.
the show is actually amazing
this show wasn t planned on getting a season 2. only lokI and what if got season 2. its clear the shows are origin stories and then the characters appear in the films instead of getting season 2
personally I think we need to hear the cats take on the show. does he make biscuits or is he kickin litter
the direct  shared the following information from sambatv   she-hulk boasts healthy viewership numbers  with data showing that 1.5 million us households streamed the series in its first four days of availability
I couldn t do something if it pissed off this many people.
she-dunk is a pet cameo showbut at least they deflect from criticismand I do indeed worry about misgendering them
this woman s attitude kinda reminds me of daisy ridley s when she responded to the backlash of mary sue rey yeah that didn t turn out very well for daisy at all considering how blacklisted she is oh she got paid alright but she hasn t been in anything else after starwars so this lady here might wanna read up on daisy ridley and see how such an attitude worked for her.
I used to be a software engineer. I have worked on many software products that I thought were shit. all I cared was that I got paid. I still did the best job that I could do. I do not see why an actor having the same attitude is different. 90  of the stuff that is made across all industries sucks. not everybody gets to work on winners.
hey I dont blame her  she s just having fun and not taking itseriously. and if she can do that while making money  more power to her. Imean really  who s to blame  if anybody  I dont put my faith in entertainment nor actors.
she better care. actors involved in bad shows and poorly performing films tend to have short careers.
02 08 the show made it to the number one in the ratings  but  they forgot to specify that the ratings were for the worst series of all times
damn I was going to back her up and not blame her for bad acting as Imainly blame the writing and the directors for the bad shows or movies but now thatshe says all of this now I cant protect her anymore. but hey I used to be a theater kid back in school so I know some things and thats why I cantalk the way I want to talk like I learned in some cases you ll have shows or movie series that will have a bad ending but a good start or a bad start but a good ending and she hulk is the bad start but good ending. I also know a few about she hulk an well she wasn t that popular as if people read her comics she does this all the time. even though she wants to sleep with men and have children with a man.
remember when entertainers didn t talk...I would love for that to go back.  maybe  just maybe  more people would watch.
unrelated  but when is melonie going to show us her puppy  !
why are you surprised  she is titania. she wants to sabotage she- hulk from the first episode. she manages to do it with this response.
I liked the batman overall. I didn t like the riddler much though. I d give it a 7.5 out of 10.
I know she hulk sucks but at least I got paid you losers!!!
it is cool being the target of the national news.
what parts of  the batman  did you feel was woke  I know there were a few lines that bothered me.
Imean I liked she hulk it felt like a weird slice of life anime...reminded me of just weird art  if that makes sense
why does disney destroy everything they touch
your cat s name is  cole train    love that. woo woo!
its funny how they rank the show as  1 and use a source to prove it that nobody has heard of and is obviously paid off.
imagine an actor on a show about dunking on men  publicly dunking on men on twitter irl. I am thoroughly shocked!  sarcasm
the show isn t doing well cuz on rotten tomatoes the show has an audience approval of 36   4.1 on imdb  and a 51  approval rating from google users so its safe to say that the show isn t going to be fondly remembered.
I think she hulk is fine and the last episode 7 showed men in a supporting light to jen. I dont find it woke at all and I like the cameos and find it funny and entertaining.
hImelonie I just wanted stop by  sayI hope you enjoyed your weekend for always bringing your thoughts on these topicstakecare melonie
congrats youre the shortlisted winner s of the ongoing playstation5 giveaway contest.....
catwoman s stupid dialog  didn t think there was that much wokeness but her line about white people was damn cringe.
@ashkihyena  every live action iteration of catwoman is pretty damn cringe
that was the only line I remember from the movie. plus her walking around like she s a  boss  really bothered me about her
Im glad marvel is getting what they deserve.
she also said she loved doing it. why should she care that you think itsucks  if someone doesnt like your videos they can not watch them right  that doesnt require you to change anything if youre legitimately proud of what youre doing. its art. its subjective. do your thing is my motto.
that actress ought to remember thatshe s a court jester and nothing more.
her comment  who cares I get to live my dream  me  me  me  me  mepretty much sums up self indulgent tone of the characters in the showits no surprise
hold on she was excited to meet her favorite mcu stars who have a good projects but she doesnt have a good project thats a weird position I want to be in if Im gonna be hanging out with cabins america whatever marvel thing I d be doing would have to be poppin. thats like going to a nude beach with mandingo.
thats def not the best way 2 keep in touch with the fans n how you want hear their feedbacks
she getting paid to do a job  I agree with her. money first  plus she s a great actress  only ones we should hate are the directors  producers  etc.
I watch movie tv show to entertain my self I drop the show after ep2 I normally stay till ep3 and with people with these kind of mindset its why hollywood sucks now
I actually like the she-hulk show  despite its flaws.
she hulk actress doesnt care that the show sucks   thats because what s most important is whether she spits or swallows.
you have such an adorable kitty!!
to clear the confusion she hulk is not doing well itstill hasn t made neilsen top ten which is industry standard and tv time is a app thatshows you what shows are out or coming out and where to watch them. their list is literally just saying which shows were most tracked on their app alone. its a pointless stat doesnt reflect actual watch time or viewership of the show an anyway.
lol. thought she s gonna throw that cat behind at 11 50 xd
honestly this is much better than sitting there malding over the negative response and putting forward even more negativity towards the group she dislikes. she s made herself clear  got the bag  thats that. at least by not caring she s partially acknowledging its garbage  otherwise she d be emotionally attached to that role because it would be important to her.thankfully people see straight through marvel s bullcrap so its all good in general. only their diehard fans that live off marvel s content drops and have signed their souls to the mcu are sitting there defending their every move  and these people dont really matter in the equation anyway  just like every other diehard ultra-attached minority of any ip.
good movies  good stories bridge gaps.
great insight!
please dont stop reading the Bible verse of the day at the end of a video  at least from time to time   it is sorely needed nowadays  a man does not live on bread alone. thanks for putting chonktrane in the spotlight to say hi
its crazy thatshe says that he dont give a fuck about it and yet men are the majority of the fans
Im with you on woke not automatically disqualifying something for me.  but if woke is all there is to something  I have no interest.
what she doesnt understand is yea she doesnt care and got paid but the next tv show or movie thatsomeone is making will probably pass on having her in there creation cause she was in a show that has done horribly and no it wasn t number 1 not even close. hell there were article like a week or 2 ago talking about how it was the first disney marvel show not to make the top 10.
thats a fair stance
Ive seen better super hero shows on the cw and better cgI on the syfy channel.there should be a drastic line between the flash tv show and the flash movie  between superman   lois and the justice league movie.we should expect more.
@tivo2go  I dont expect more from marvel when it comes from this project. marvel has barely made any changes from the source material to the movies when you look at it as a whole. many people dont understand how fucking awful she-hulk was in the comic books. Im not surprised when marvel is forced to come up with original material  and it flops. I look at it from the perspective of kevin fiege  this is clearly a practice run where they lose out on nothing  but they can still use it to test behind the scene stuff out. I am sure the studio isn t sweating the l they have taken for this one.
they aren t even trying. its just a lame show. she-hulk has so many great characteristics and great storylines they could ve used or at least mined for good material. its sad when they waste a chance to produce good stuff for our gals to enjoy and maybe look up to.
here s what I dont understand or u could call it a plot hole. so ya they have thatscene of the internet canceling she hulk and saying all that bad stuff right  but how they re saying it is like as if they re talking about the show or like a fictional thing. now if we just go by the mcu world rules which basically goes by the real world rules to an extent  how does that make any sense like let s take the youtubers for example  they re talking about how woke this is and bashing on men and all which I agree and they re trying to do the same thing about she hulk within the show. to me that didn t make any sense cus then its like they could have been saying this to all the female super heroes thats been in the mcu the whole time and they haven t. a small example is how one of the comments says  stop making female superheroes  as if people are literally making them in the mcu on purpose and how they act. so like they re literally making superheroes and villains and people are just getting tired of them.hopefully that made sense to what Im saying and its been bothering me the whole time and thats only one of the main issues I have with this show. maybe its suppose to be a  meta  thing since she hulk breaks the 4th wall and ok that makes sense from that pov  but at the same time it doesnt if they re actually trying to tell a story or follow the mcu plot. oh wait  they dont care about that.
she hulk wanted to one up batwoman on being the most toxic show.
so wait a sec...the argument at first was   we gotta make more inclusive content!   despite the existing content being available to anyone who wanted to get in on it. so they changed the content to be  more inclusive  but really ended up alienating a ton of the old fans. now the old fans complain about this  and they re called terrible things and they should just shut up and enjoy it or go watch something else cause this new content isn t for them.now I dunno  but thatseems down right malicious. the old fans were more than  justified in telling these nufans to eff off cause this content was what is was and if they dont like it  they can find their own. but they actually said fine and played along. now the nufans are being  well  evil by telling the old fans to eff off cause its not for them. the exact opposite of what the old fans graciously did for the nu fans.
I tried to watch thatshow I couldn t even finish the first episode. its so bad I only saw it for 10 minutes and quit. I started seeing another show because I didn t like it lol!
my cup is full . ok  the good thing is that it reminds me of the black keys  I got mine   which is a great riff to play. bad thing itsounds like a gloating narcissist punching down... unless its fiendishly clever and meta - as melonie almost suggests - the show breaks the fourth wall in-universe  on screen  and takes the plot to the youtubers  who are obviously the villain. there s precious little plot on screen soooo it must be a grand truman show meta parody  right
Im one of the few out there that does not subscribe to any streaming services. sounds like Im not missing out on much.
since you couldnt quite pace it out  I ll thell you who the real villain is  she hulk.
the only time I place any criticism or blame on the actors is when they feel the need to come out and bash the audience. like brie s comments about  huwhite men   or jameela taking elitist pot shots at the audience. other than that  it ain t the actors fault  they re just hired to do a job. its the writers  directors and producers who come up with this garbage  that disdain the very people they re supposed to be marketing to.they should feel threatened. with people like rippa   the rippaverse now entering the comics arena  outlets like the daily wire now making movies  hollyweird s grip on entertainment is starting to slip  and thats a good thing.
dont hate the player  hate the game.
always speak with your wallets. dont give these studios your views  dont give them your time unless you are getting it for free aka sail the seven seas. stick it to them where it hurts where the studios will pull a zaslav on them.
men will be held responsible if the show gets canceled  nevermind the fact that its a bad show. disney and marvel will never admit that its bad show   men will just get blamed that it failed cause thats the scapegoat and par for the course in today s climate.
Imissed the part where thats my problem bully maguire--
the new batman is pretty good. dc is gonna make a comeback
I am just sad and mad that disney is going to f  @ up the daredevil
jameela jamil is absolutely desperate to make herself the queen of the woke. why do you think she went so hard after jk rowling thing is  she s so absolutely tone-deaf that every tweet she sends out reveals how self-obsessed and narcissistic she really is. basically  she is her character from the good place and she has no idea. she ll dig her own metaphorical grave.
I use to respect actors and actresses.  now that we have social media   I can see how childish and spoiled rotten all of them are .
hImelonie congrats on hitting 58k have you played days gone its a fun zombie game
to be fair  why would it matter if she did care that the show was trash  its not like the show would suddenly be watchable if only she cared a little more. the issue is with the writing  she cant do dick about that and good writing or bad  she s stuck with the the show. what else can she do but make the most of it let me present to you the koan of the tiger and the strawberries  once upon a time  as a man was walking through a forest  he saw a tiger peering out at him from the underbrush. as the man turned to run  he heard the tiger spring after him to give chase.barely ahead of the tiger  running for his life  our hero came to the edge of a steep cliff. clinging onto a strong vine  the man climbed over the cliff edge just as the tiger was about to pounce.hanging over the side of the cliff  with the hungry tiger pacing above him  the man looked down and was dismayed to see another tiger  stalking the ravine far below. just then  a tiny mouse darted out from a crack in the cliff face above him and began to gnaw at the vine.at that precise moment  the man noticed a patch of wild strawberries growing from a clump of earth near where he dangled. reaching out  he plucked one. it was plump  and perfectly ripe  warmed by the sunshine.he popped the strawberry into his mouth. it was perfectly delicious. the end.
imagine if they made a show hating on women but then got mad women didnt watch it
loving the ink
disney handed the show over to a group of people who wanted it to fail from the start. to them it was an easy paycheck and a way to slap men around and crap on something they like. this will have ripples that may end the mcu. what a waste of great characters.
at least she is honest  not bragging the message or agenda.
literally 90  of the she hulk comic fan base were men reading them so for this show to be made for the people  that have been forgotten about  makes no sense. especially when its loaded with hatred towards men based on the creator  jessica gao s  own perspectives.
how many episodes is this show  I thought it be over by now
I think the worst part is trash shows like she-hulk are actually hurting women in media. when women lead shows like this fail it make people less likely to take a chance on them in the future. companies are going to look at how negative shows like she-hulk were received and have reasons to reject future projects. toxic woke stuff like this is damaging to women s roles as characters and or creators in future media.
you guys are the freakin heroes. literally the only entertaining aspect of these shows are your reviews. the worse the show the better the review.
its showing you she-hulk not every woman on she-hulk its treated the same
the easiest way to tell if a show is great is if its critically acclaimed. meaning the majority of people have favorable reviews and there s a buzz around it kind of like shows like game of thrones or breaking bad did. if 50 50 split and the drama being. the scenes is more interesting than the show itself. then its below average especially if its not performing well with majority of your target demographic. jameela on the other hand is just childish and has a lot more growing up to do. no one should take her seriously cause its giving high school behavior.
hopefully the tweet backfires on her and nobody will employee her since she did not care for the work she was doing
I ll be honest I think that its fair thatshe doesnt care. because at the end of the day she could be the best actress ever and it would still suck because it is the screenwrite at the end of the day. like ik her tweet that youre looking at is confusing but her not caring is fair. she got paid and did what she wanted. her specifically did not hurt anyone. Imean she could have denied even doing the thing and the movie would have a different lead actress. would I have liked for her to care and advocate for less of a man hating role  absolutely. but does it really matter  I dont think so
I would love a season 2 of she-hulk and yeah I want her to use her powers to save a few more lies but its a lawyer show you know there s so many of us that love how the show played out
ive heard people talk about the mcu shows rushing the ending  and I never felt it was a huge deal. until this show  nothing has happened yet! even the      buildup     of the villains has been almost nothing  so now they are going to force it all into the last 2 episodes. actually they will probably have another nothing episode and pack the story and destruction of the villain into 24 minutes.
I wonder when it became her dream to be in a marvel property  probably in 2012 after avengers and marvel became the cool new it thing among normies.
bollywood sorta better than hollywood rn
tbf the only thing I love bout the show are the sketches made in the credits that look well drawn and colored. the rest I dont hate or love its more .meh its a show
as a man  the show was at least half decent  people are hating on it like its the next the room.. it really wasn t that bad  the finale was pretty bad though..
wonder if she ll care when her attitude stops studio s hiring her because fans dislike her because of it
so when jamil says she s been a huge mcu fan but she-hulk was made for  the people this genre forgot about   who is she talking about  clearly not herself because she just said she enjoyed the mcu  does that mean she-hulk is not for her either  and if not her  who then is the target audience it just goes to show that  its not for you sweetie  is just a vapid deflection. if it was actually good it would be  for everyone  regardless of the intended target audience.
if this is so great why does disney  not have a like   dislike on the website so you can post your opinion
Ive said this in other places  but this incident perfectly encapsulates everything wrong with the mcu after end game. she is openly and blatantly admitting that they know its shit just like the rest of the products they ve been spewing out and they dont care because they re getting paid. so what if they destroy the characters. so what if the writing makes no sense. so what if its painfully boring. they got paid and why should they care  indeed... why should they care  they did get paid. it would be bad enough that these products are staffed full of acting talent that doesnt care about the job they do but its apparent that thats the case all the way up from the writer s room  to the director  and to the set designers. these series look like shit and they re written just as badly. I cant really blame the actors for trying to get work regardless of what the jobs are. it is their professions after all. its the fact that itseems to be the same with literally everyone involved thats killing all of it.
you cant treat trans equally by picking on them like you would anyone else because its punching down  so  why is marvel disney punching down to little youtubers ok
kitty appearance!  11 46
I would like to see a scientific survey done on how people would rate it  not the number of streams that was cherry picked from one app. delusional  your reality is your perception. cant hate on getting paid  they might be secret dc comic fans...
I liked some of the episodes but for me since the wedding episode Im like uuuugh  noooo
I give her credit for admitting it.  she didn t write it  so why should she care.  and criticizing actors  which I am sure some people were doing  because they are weirdly upset about a stupid show is pointless and mean.  if you do not like she-hulk  do not watch it.  I can see in the first couple episodes people criticizing it as they sampled it and reviewers give their opinions  or if some show suddenly changed and started going bad and people who liked it are mad ...but I never got hate watching episode after episode of a show you do not like  just to rip on it.that is what the actress was saying  is she got paid and why are you watching it if you dont like it.  she hulk is hardly some beloved marvel hero.
hey  meloniemacgobom ... the actress didn t write the show  probably has 0 input on the direction or actions that the creators are taking  but she loves having a chance to act and be paid for it... look how many of us have worked for a company that we thought what they were producing or charging was terrible  but we were there for the pay check... we didn t care if the owner of the company was woke  conservative  Christian  jewish  man  woman or them!!!  we should focus our issue with the producers and not those paid to perform dialog...the show is bad  itsucks  it is painful to watch... but the way marvel works you have to watch for the easter eggs so you dont miss something...  look at all the people that didn t watch book of boba fett  when they see mandalorian 3 they will be lost on his ship  how grogo got back in the show and who is alive and dead...
of course she would say all she care about was ....
overly defensive position once again from the  celebrity   leftoid -  screw you because I was briefly on television   before show was cancelled  wow well its hard to argue with that logic.that truly absolves any criticism right  another weirdo.Im personally very happy anyway to have discovered this channel  via fnt   - thank you very much melonie!
humans as ornaments   name thatsong!
its totally possible to have a man hating woman that works. catalina in grand theft auto is a great example of that. but that requires real artists who know what they re doing. she-hulk cant be asked to be half as good. and the actress isn t helping the case with this childish behavior.
I honestly dont see why we think this is a bad thing. you guys do get that acting is an actors job right  just like doing youtube commentary is melanie s job  being a warehouse clerk is my job  and flipping burgers is some teenagers job. we all do it for the money. does that make us bad people  no. it makes us employees. she s an employee too. just because her employment is a lot more glamorous than ours doesnt make it not employment. nobody gets mad at samuel l jackson when he does a stinker of a movie do they  no. because we all know he ll take any job that you can afford to pay him to do. so why are we mad at her  in fact we need more people in hollywood like her. even she needs to be more like her. keep your personality out of it. youre there to do a job. do your job and cash your paycheck.
jamile jamile   she has as much creativity in her life and career as her parents had in naming her.  lets go with jar jar instead.
yeah  this show was made for embittered  lonely  mid-to-late career professional women to cash-in on their misandry and inability to maintain a relationship. it appeals to their childish belief that all of their problems are because men are trash  not because they have misandry and character flaws that they are failing to work through. I wish they would just cop to that before the credits or whatnot  stop pretending itshould be seen as anything more than that  and move on. that would at least be a welcome bit of honesty.
they know they got a bogus product and this is why they re attacking you guys they want the viewing public to buy defective product basically  they are pissing on the viewers and telling them its raining
keep in mind that all content creators are not equal.there s no point in actually listening to the reviews from the people who shill for these businesses. aka the access media and their affiliates.youreceive any kind of incentive from the entertainment industry  there s no point even listening to your review.
the main character is a toxic feminist and has many annoying traits that make her unrelatable and unlikeable to most people. they can possibly redeem her by making her grow out of being a monster. but they seem to really like her toxic traits.
dont try to be an  ally  to people who want to perpetually be victims. living this way is extremely freeing.
they talk about youtubers like the quartering  critical drinker  drunk3po  myself... you are completely fucking wrong here  melonie  acknowledging you  and other women like you  requires them to admit that the backlash isn t sexist.
she-hulk actress doesnt care the show sucks  why should she  she doesnt write it  get that bag.
lol true  they re just focusing on hating on the white men
a new religion with rules that can be changed like wikipedia at any moment.
Ive enjoyed all of disney s marvel series so far. some more some less. she-hulk is the first series which find tedious to watch. there s no story and characters are one dimensional caricatures. thankfully there s andor which has several interesting plot lines and well written characters.
but she hulk doesnt suck
all that matters is me. thats the message of the show  so she s perfect for the role. its a show about female entitlement  immorality and selfishness. its a show for women on the left basically  a show produced and written by bad people  consumed by bad people.
I quite like she hulk
shulk  attorney at law. Im really feeling it.
the show is incompetently written by majority of it being women who still haven t worked through their personal issues with the men in their past and haven t bettered their perspective about the world nor have they sought to develop themselves either. this entire show are the writers projecting their immaturities and projecting their misperceptions of men.the show is not successful at all. she-hulk has a 35  audience score on rotten tomatoes  4.9 out of 10 user rating on imdb and 2.1 out of 5 google audience rating. I think the actress showed an unknown out of context analytic to try to win an online argument when in reality she knows the show isn t doing good which is why she made that comment about not caring if there isn t a 2nd season.
I didn t know streaming services had ratings
cant fault her for it. in the end  she put food on the table  energy on the lamps  water on the pipes. thats literally all we need to live.
actually  to be frank  it is really not her fault that the show sucks.. she is just doing what the script says... and she indeed got paid for this gig. nothing she said is false in the tweet.
melonie  I get the point about the batman movie  but the real problem comes with the understanding of what woke idealogy is  it is deeply immoral  racist  fascist  and totalitarian in nature. it is poisonous and it kills everything it touches. until people realize this and fight it accordingly  we wont see it defeated. so  you might get a few reasonable movies with it  but the poison will spread and it will kill the product in the end.
mel.I got an idea on how the show could ve been interesting instead of the stupid hetero patriarc white annoying dude  itshould have been an ex-boyfriend of jen begging for her help since he got scammed by the elder stupid like elf in the second or third episode.instead of going on stupid cases  she uses some unlikely events to help stablish the superhuman situationnal laws.show her time off-work as a way its natural  we all hate our jobs in a terrible day and often need a drink with the squad or family.even the wedding shitty episode  by making her realising thatshe is getting more lonely but struggling to find a right love interest  not by making her use a tinder-like app but by attending bars or parties .the titania villain would be a  you stole my man  or some dumb story like the fights in mean girls.cut all the jokes by pointing out the harsh comments of reality on the 4th wall lines thatshe uses as a way to complain to real life.are they good ideas  I was going to open up a yt channel on fixing this show and also doing an overall review for some of the characters who got wasted and disrespected over the past movies or series.
lol not sure if this is a form of quite quitting or loudly begging to get fired by cancellation
honestly with the bevy of problems I have with hollywood  with disney  with the mcu  with how horrible she hulk was  with a million things I could go off on this doesnt bother me in the slightest.if the show was bad because she was the star and gave an awful performance and said she didn t care thats a different story.but a bunch of idiots got together in a room and made one of the worst shows in the history of tv and its not just bad but its a slap in the face and an f u to long time marvel fans.  this actress has nothing to do with that.  I hear content creators that ostensibly love comics and want the mcu to be great brag that they made money on how awful the show is.  what s the difference it wasn t this one supporting actresses job to write and produce this show. to know the lore and make sure it was respected. it wasn t her idea to have the awful awful last episode rendering the whole mcu a joke. she got hired to play a character she doesnt care about and no Im not mad at her for not going  please give this job to someone that cares about she hulk  one bit
I find it funny tbh that jameela jamil only became woke shall we say when she got to america and jumped on the bandwagon in the uk she had a show on radio 1 and also did the sunday chart show she also worked on a music channel called t4 and worked on another channel called e4 were she never had a problem
if they re making thatshow for all the people that action movies forgot  then should they not feel compelled to make a drama about stuffy british people during the victorian era which appeals to men it takes a special kind of arrogance to congratulate yourself for programming to women at a time when the entirety of the media incessantly and shamelessly panders to women.
not here to proselytize my Christian faith but  her tweet reminds me of proverbs 22 1  a good name is more desirable than great riches  to be esteemed is better than silver or gold.  sigh  how value systems have changed.
if I was on thatshow I wouldn t care if people liked it or not and I wouldn t complain as long as my money was clearing in my account. and fans have a right to say they like something or they dont I wouldn t care either way and it wouldn t make a statement about it because they re butt hurt its not enough to take out paid they want it to be good and sadly it ain t working
lol @ her shoving it in the face of a random twitter user.  sweet Jesus. on a show of lame performances and terrible characters  she might be the worst of them.  they just need to accept the l and let it be.  their pivot to trying to make she-hulk the rosa parks of the mcu is embarrassing. women loved the mcu pre-disney  just as much as men did.  thats why they did obscenely well with most of their movies. it wasn t all dudes.
most hollywood celebs are just about the bag! its a damn shame...

really  am Imissing something here  how was the show woke  it was funny. if you dont like it then let disney know! I enjoyed every episode! or either I am out of touch.
Im low key hoping disney and marvel ends up losing so much money that all the quality of these shows and movies end up looking like those straight to dvd knockoffs. I hope that happens soon. I d probably get disney  if that happens.
she went from the good place to this wtf
I think you are exhibiting a victimhood complex by assuming she hulk is painting you or jeremy as the villians. I think the villians are basically a metaphor for incels. I dont assume you or jeremy are involuntarily celibate
0 22 I thought you said hump right into it
we get it you have a bias. you cant watch something unless you agree with it and like it 100 . if its not birds of prey...youre gonna hate it. its a good thing that we dont just create entertainment that is catered just for you  because the world does not revolve around you. however your criticism would imply that it does. if its not for me  I just dont watch it and find something else to watch. shehulk is proving more and more that it is not a  man-hating show  like you claim. the longer the show goes on  its only getting better  more people are watching and enjoying it. people are buying your complaints. you say shehulk isn t even in the top 10 and you show it in your video. it is in the top 10. it was  1 in the whip report. on neilson  it is 9th place. meaning it has in fact  made the top 10. you are wrong. shehulk is growing and more people are jumping on to watch it. youre confused  because you hate watch it and dont watch it at all but half ass it for clout  here.it is not a man-hating show. men and women are treated equally in shehulk. we re 7 episodes in  and youre still hung up on this being a man-hating show  when it isn t. tatiana maslany is an actress. she didn t write the comic book or the show. she s on a contract  to act in shehulk. are you in a marvel project  do you go to these events  tatiana maslany is literally living the dream right now. she nailed it. yes  who cares if youre not entertained  she s an actress  she didn t make the show. there s a lot of other content out there to choose from  if you dont like shehulk.  tatiana maslany is a marvel fan. she s excited to be in one of the movies tv shows  as she should be. as anyone would be!that was a comment about herself and her achievements. what do you mean you dont know what she does  doofy  she s a celebrity because she s an upstanding actress. she acts. she made a good point  if you dont want to be misgendered in order to prevent outrage over being misgendered  you should add your pronouns...on. twitter. notice now  how youre trying to prove that this is a  go woke go broke  show...by speculating over tatiana maslany s tweet about misgendering someone  which is separate from the show and received 13.5 likes. how is that a dunk on her  it looks like 13.5k people agreed with her. maybe you should just go back to watching birds of prey...
I love she-hulk. thatshow is awesome.
if the show is crap the directors are to blame .the cast is just doing what they re told to do.
your cat is more relevant than she hulk
to be fair I wouldnt care either if it was terrible and I dont call the shots. if she was helping to write the show then yeah she should be accountable but as an actor you can only do your job acting and promoting
Im just here for daredevil
for the people  bi-the people
at least it is obvious titania said what she really thinks  she is honest. not very nice tho...  hmm
mcu might be in trouble...first time I ever thought that...wtf smh
me and her share the opinion  we both dont care about the show
that cat is huge
I dont trust her source nor sambatv. I only go by neilsen and she hulk with premiere didn t even crack the top 10 streaming originals. the 2nd ep did and hit  10
marvel comics  we dont need male fans  proceeds to loose money. marvel movies  we dont need the male fans  proceeds to loose more money see a connection
fans that has been forgotten. huh  never heard marvel comics were an interest of high-class  wine drinking  40yo single women. because thats the target demographicand honestly  at least the actress is honest about it  she s getting paid so whatever. its better than having them say these atrocious pieces are a  love letter  or that they re  long term fans . cut the bs and be upfront  we dont like the product regardless of your personal investment on it
didn t the actress agree with the fans at first  she probably just doesnt care because why should she  its not like she or anyone else has to try since itsucks so bad.
well thats the thing  the people they are attacking are not incels. they are just calling them that just like they call everyone a bigot for no reason
birds of prey is pretty dope
@todd stone  weird  because melanie said to roast her over that in the comments  when she said she prefers birds of prey. because she is at least somewhat  self-aware to realize that movie wasn t that great. but because she is a fan  of harley quinn...that is why she enjoys itso much over shehulk. she has a bias thatshe cannot let go.
@krs-1  dont we all
@todd stone  no  because when I dont like something  I dont go onto make a video trying to convince others that the show or movie sucks and insist it is something that its not. what it is  is possibly  just not for me. shehulk is in the top 10  1 rank  of all the programming on disney  that is a good thing  and proves the show is being enjoyed by viewers and the series continues.
@krs-1  do you honestly believe it deserves to be number 1
@todd stone  every show is ranked  as it deserves to be ranked. because people watch it. it earned that rank. it earned all those views.
@krs-1  I think youre part of the minority on these takes but I respect your views on them
@todd stone  I dont think im part of the minority  when again  she-hulk is ranked top 10  1 on disney  of all its programming...but cool.
its 1984. big sjster is watching you.
the   1 piece of media watched in the world consistently are commercials  doesnt make em good  doesnt mean people like em
I can see how marvel fans wouldn t like this I think its awesome I think she hulk didn t get done perfect thats for sure but I like a bunch of the stuff some of it does seem obvious like the fact thatshe s going to get attacked for her blood Imean it was obvious thing if you have power somebody who s going to want your blood no I like how she got with daredevil
she s essentially admitted thatshe thinks the show sucks too! plus  she might have got paid  but if the producers had done a much better job  she could be getting paid even more money  so she s also taking money away from herself with her stuck-up attitude!
why is mm extra pretty all of a sudden
you know she hulk is bad when iron fist is no longer the worst series. at least they had more fights and actual villains
she-hulk  stds at law
I am just watching this video coz of you !!love from india !!
offcourse they dont care  none of these agenda pushers activists care about shitting on established fanbases and established source materials because to them hate or not they got their bag and bs message out. thats why the only way to hit them is to hit them where it hurts  the bag. dont see none of their shows  movies and dont buy the merch etc either and make all their future roles not worth the investment because they got a bad rep.
like this hair better then the old one.
I feel like the marvel tv cinematic universe adds little to nothing to the mcu. think of it this way imagine if there was a she-hulk  hawkgirl  or ms. marvel live action movie. they would rather loose money or make some on tv then take a total l via the big screen.
imagine my shock
preach part 3
8 07 guilty confession I was watching your cat in the background  Im sorry. I ll subscribe to make things right.
the cat s name is coltrane  respect
number 1 in their dream land.
shes gonna get canned an then shes not gonna find any work with anyone cuz of her attitude and behavior toward the fans. the very people that can even decide if she s relevant an can dictate her career as an actress in any movie or tv series.
by the way  they had to tease daredevil to get people to watch.  they baited people into watching their trash show.
its too much comic relief for me and I haven t seen any action considering its a hulk movie
I was enjoying the latest episode until the last 8-10 mins
I think I can guess what at least one of your favorite things are
so...the lead actress doesnt care about the quality of the product which predominantly has her face on display nearly 90 percent of the time
so  not a care that they are crapping on the character of which they are making a show  not a care that the show totally sucks or that most of the actual fans of the actualcharacter of she hulk feel betrayed  only cares thatshe got to do what she wanted and thatshe got paaaaaaaaaiiiid...  seems pretty self absorbed and narcissistic. actually kind of like all of the characters in this show really.
she s a wannabe tough girl that is too damn scared to back up those words
if the app is small enough anyone can be in that top 1 on each week...just fudge the numbers
thump up for the kitty cat in the back.
it was nice she admitted her show sucks.  at least there was some honesty.show will be nothing but trash.
I dont care  ya we know
damn  who would ve thought that jamila wasn t acting in the good place and is just truly a selfish and disgusting woman...
maybe she just wants out and dont like the part right now.
honestly  this is the first thing the actress has said that I respect a bit. she s not the writer  so the show s quality isn t her issue. yes its about the money! why the hell else do you go to work  do I agree with the show s narrative  hell no! but its not like I went to work for a moving company because I like moving people s heavy stuff xd
yooo yt recommends the best looking ppl sometimes nice curls lady
I always forget how different you look withojt eyeliner. everytime I see you without them I go....who dis
why would she possibly care  one of the reasons it is tanking couldn t possibly be her. could it
dump the green screen  be yourself
she s so outta touch thatshe cant see that they turned her character into a complete joke. how sad.
funny. cute smart
I dont know who s worse  the characters  the actors or the company.
ngl I stop watching once she said thatshe know how to control being a try bc everyday women have to go through stuff and bruce was just trying to tell her once u lose control they will always see you as a monster he been through so much then her he has lost his love of his life his dad tested on him dad killed him mom then he lost his gf he was gonna married yeah and lost his bf tony only guy that didn t see him as monster but nah she had to think about her job
cat cuddlescant spell  mice  without  mic
boom
wife was quicker than me to say how awful the show was
Imiss you saying what s up my boomers  its me melonie mac. its like your phase now
who sustain the cartoon all over the years  us  the men s!!!!
I wonder how 70s feminists would react if we told them that progress would lead to media being created that you are not allowed to dislike even if the media is not entertaining or good.
I am glad you spotted the same thing I did. it was such a cheat way to boast about an achievement by posting a tracking app rating.
see  if they dont care why should I watch their show
I can picture without closing my eyes- a bad cgIversion of jeremy from the quartering duking it out and getting beat before daredevil swoops in and has to be saved before she can shut his channel shut down save the female gender half of the world and her and matt murdoch screw. season ender.
how the mighty have fallen. I liked her as tahinI from the good place
great video!!!!
she is right. heck yeah get your bag. yet that is the quiet part that you dont say out loud.
our new modern-day thespians  lawl.
I like the actress  she was good in the good place  but she isn t handling this well. no one can blame her for taking the role  it pays  and keeps her name out there.however  the fact thatshe is going ham on social media only proves that it bothers her  maybe she is still butthurt from her severe injury to her asshole during filming. casting couch injury maybe
you could not be more right  they eat each other alive!!
me personally I love the show but thats just me
the woke narrative thing is too complicated its like jumping in quicksand  you will sink
I will never in my life make any attempt to square away people s pronouns.
she should have said nothing
does anyone believe she is a comic book fan
I cant get mad at that
exactly like mark hamill. curious
she actually is that person in real life!
lol I agree  she should have kept that to herself
number one in the ratings my a s.
good video!
marvel does better with their male characters than their female characters overall except for black widow other than her dying which her life saved the half of the universe which would have met the other half would have died because plans were falling apart she gave up everything for everyone else she gave the chance to save everyone all tony did was stop the guy from getting them back in a battle to me I think black widow deserves more fan you know memory
nagging  insulting  and manipulative behavior wont get me to watch this any more than it ll make me love my ex.
I told you she was a bad role for wonder woman in league of superpets.
your video thumbnail and title is a bit unlucky  as it implies that its tatiana maslany  the lead actress  doing this...
oh  hey melonie.
I never even watched the show
Ive enjoyed the memes from the show but Ive not liked any of the clips Ive seen so far of it
seems like she s just method acting. keeps up her closeness to the character if she stays her character all day and its probably good for marking. hate viewers count too.
jameela jamils response is in such bad taste.
the power of youtube   big cinema is very worried about the youtube community .youtube is definitely seen as a threat ..
made for people this genre forgot about  so it was made solely for me then  except Im not watching it  so thatshould say something right there.
probably under contract not to say anything negative  pretty typical
they created a show with no compelling story  or no story at all really  and cant figure out why people think itsucks.
I dont look at it as a woke message. or anything political. I just wanted to watch it too c what marvel going with it. I wasn t impressed with like 3 movies but I love marvel movies n shows. go marvel
this show spreads so much negativity and hate. its insane.
to be honest they hate the fan base  if not then why not use the source material of the character.  disney did it to star wars  why not the mcu
if she doesnt care  then... she is no artist.
tv time app is inaccurate
at the end of the day she doesnt care about her legacy  if she s not forgotten she ll be remembered for attacking fans  getting her money  being less likeable than brie larson and a bad cgI arse and then when she s old nearly forgotten and lost her money and youth I gotta wonder what her thoughts will be or even if there ll be regret and tears. then will she ll care
imagine spending so much time and energy on something you dont like. smh
yup not caring about your project and not giving your all no wonder itsucks so bad
isn t that girl from the good place  lol not elinor  a... dont remember but  she would have stayed on the good place...
the show is really bad  every episode manages to shame men  at least once  but   I ... kinda  agree with her  in some aspects   she is an actress  gets payed for her role  cannot change the way the narrative goes  loves marver universe  plays a charracter from that marvel universe  maybe viewers should go for the writer of the show  and  not for the actress that plays the charracter
aye butter girl love content
this is like bragging when you are the worst player on the worst team in sports.   so what if you got paid
is she really rosanne s grand daughter
the difference  ask seinfeld and ask all other one season wonders
I didn t mind the show but marvel would benefit more from dark story telling more than central  comedy I wanna see punisher   ghost rider killing people rated r fashion. idk
she is entitled to her opinion. she will have to deal with that later. its a tweet
I like you..so I subscribed
the actress has nothing to do with the story and script. she s right  she got paid. she s just an actor  relax. the show might suck but not her fault.
based
Im sad kitty never let me pet it
the batman was woke  I dont recall that anywhere. where was it woke
wow she doesnt care about the cast the crew that will be effected when they loose their jobs when itsinks. as long as she is happy she did a crappy job at   axting .
I dnt mind what she said.people are telling her they dnt like the show cool others might and she got payed.not everything is for everyone.if people would call me im im gonna tell then I had a amazing time I got payed and hows ur life.just cause they are a random doesnt mean u can come for them
sources inside say it is getting hardly any views
she s talking about victims. thats all they ever talk about.  they  being victims  of course...
jameela jamil has no pride in her work or her show. sad thing is thatshe probably got a larger paycheck than robert downey jr. for his first iron man role which was  500k.
this show is one big troll. lmfao
I think  that they re trying to copy the joker formula by disguising their awful wine mom leftover woman show as capeshit  because that genre still has some life in it.
well Imean she not lying it money end of day
too bad jumanjI jalopy turned out to be this way.  I liked her in the good place....
disney is about to star wars the mcu yo omg ...the new avengers team is going to filled with a bunch of reys......   smh
yes its true she hulk is number one. on sights paid by disney.house of the dragon is number one on sights paid by hbo.rings of power is number 1 on sights owned by amazon.
like teen titans go.
if Im not gonna accept nagging  complaining  and insults from my ex  why would I accept it from these schmucks
everyone listen to what this person  has to say cuss she is a woman is even saying thatshe hulk is shit and the only reason that people are watching it because every ending thats when it gets good the ending watch every episode and the ending will get you to continue watching it like for example I even knew her boyfriend was bad because obviously every man in this show was evil manipulative and just downright a dog so I was not surprised when we found out that he was not as he appears to be but glad thatsomeone sees the shit cake besides me
netflix did it great with marvel.punisher. daredevil. jessica jones. luke cage. s.h.i.e.l.d. agent carter.
she s a woke tool. lol  its too bad because she s gorgeous and not a bad actress.
I guess loves that train wreck of a marvel film  while anime rains supreme doesnt have horrible cgI and wokeness dumb stuff western media wishes   butt hurt anime is doing and breaking records! sad some anime dubs are sneaking woke stuff in from some translators who some how get invovled and get a bit mad with power channels hero heI   revsaysdesu covered.Imiss when marvel   dc things were good and not so annoying Ive legit not cared of western media in a really long time mostly all things bash us guys for  female empowerment  but we shouldn t do all that and the consistent  dont watch or read my thing  we dont and boom! their thing flops! lmao Im not the biggest marvel fan in the world but still.
yeah she probably regrets thatshe could not abort a baby to star in the show.
I agree with her she hulk got paid and the shows fun
the first 50 sec is true
daredevil made it to  1. non cares about she hulk
honestly  who can really blame an actress for this attitude  lots of people more famous than her have been in bad movies for a paycheck.
in getting back to the show  I immediately saw that you nailed it.
yeah thats my opinion too  I just think making personal attacks at randoms on twitter made her look worse. she didn t need to do that  she would have maintained the high road otherwise
it would have been better to just end it at getting paid and meeting people  but I grudgingly respect someone who can double and triple down on things.
of course she did.  I called it.  she s so predictable.
what is your definition of  higher road
melonie mac... jemilka jamsammich... tooty fruity... zoop troop...
I cant blame jamel s jamil too much for her mindset. Imean the writers suck  the director sucks the producers suck and the company that made itsucks. she s an actress that can only do so much with her role  not much she can really do to make the show not suck. in all fairness you could keep everything the same and replace jameela jamil with someone like scarlett johansson or some other big name female actress and this show would still suck and it would suck just as much.
this show was so stupid and offensive to everyone itshould be buried in the desert at midnight.  as a retired lawyer  the way they stereotype lawyers made me sick to my stomach  all but daredevil.
someone calling everyone toxic makes a toxic comment  no wai...
definitely a show about nothing.
her crap acting on the show makes it painfully obvious thatshe didn t care about the show.
you are on time it happened two four years ago
isn t entertainment made to keep the masses quiet and content.. our leaders are getting way too cocky with this crap
she not going to have another show
you look great
she hulk is the first of all the marvel tv shows ever to not make it in the top 10 viewed shows list. what is this person talking about
I dont blame her tbh I blame the fucking writers and directors
wait the batman was a bit woke  how so  genuine question
Imean. I cant blame her.if I had that job  I d be able to recognize the shitshow before me and not care about it. take your paycheck  have whatever fun you can and go home.
I think this show is trying to guilt trip men more than it is showing how to play the woman victim  which it does that too
actresses  and writers of she-hulk are like   we had fun and we got paid making this show and now we are part of the marvel club so we can go to conventions and meet the real men and characters that built this franchise. and if you dont like it well to bad cuz we dont care about the consumer  shame on disney  for allowing this disrespect towards their customer! and why is disney  making a show that isn t made for 90  of its subscribers   Im I paying monthly to disney  for what woke propaganda and to see the worst show and movies ever made of all time    disney  is going to fail long term  they are competing with netflix and prime and other streaming services the are producing new content on a monthly sometimes weekly basis  disney  is limited to 4 franchises  disney  pixar  marvel and lucasfilms. marvel and star wars are their biggest money makers so they are forced to drop quantity over quality and its showing big time. thats why everything that was made before disney  existed is awesome everything that came after disney s streaming service is shit. think about it logically and you ll see that disney  is doom to fail. they ll still make money but the reputation is what going to hurt them.
I cant stand jameela but damn she s hot. I saw her tweet last night and I really wanted to bash her. I think I did. lol.
why should the actress be concerned with people liking the show  she didn t write the show. she didn t direct or produce it. whe did her job  had a great time itsounds and got paid. she s not name calling critics nor putting them down just asking how they are doing. I feel you aren t being very constructive with your criticism of this actress.
not making personal attacks at the show s critics  she can defend herself without stooping to that. but like I said in this video  I dont see her perceived mindset in general to be egregious. I just think she could have handled the discourse better than she did
true true
I gotta disagree on the new  batman  movie. I dont know what that movie was  but it wasn t a batman movie. I have walked out of 2 movies in my life and thatstinker was  2.
cool
my question is why do celebrities always  need to take the high road all the time they are people if want clap back at some random person I say let them
melonie mac has a better handle on she hulks lovable  goofball personality  and she isnt even trying to be she hulk.
its cazy to see a women hate on another actress
hmm.  weird  cause neither do I care.  so strange
aside from sone youtubers and critics no one talks about she hulk. thats how you know the show is d.o.a. I really believe that the cast and schills spouting woke nonsense is a last flailing attempt to become relevant.  unfortunately for disney and others there s so much woke crap out there its not getting any traction putting the series where it belongs... in the trash.
she got triggered and started showing her selfish true colors  she got paid she doesnt care if the show is awful. the only good things that have come from she-hulk are your videos
they have already shown this show didn t even crack the top six or so in the nielsen ratings which is the real one they also said its the first time for any kind of marvel thing to do so poorly. plus the ratings are declining a lot of people just aren t watching it anymore. I think most people watching it at this point or hate watching it like us lol the show is so bad I still feel like they re trying to do this on purpose and make it fail on purpose because you wouldn t put out some product like this associated with a billion dollar industry like the mcu  and just put out straight garbage. its almost a mockery
yes she got paid from she-hulk. just wonder how about her carreer after she-hulk.
isn t she the boring woman who is titana  anyway deadpool 3
this no care attitude is so dumb... you cantell she is all about the money...
when you take pride in a garbage show  you know your career is not going well.
if  entertainment  company s make so much crap  its not hard to get to nr 1 with crap. for me the whole marvel thing is dead for some time  had my fun with the first movies.
I refuse to watch anything woke. excuse me while I binge watch top gun 2.
okay  so what  should she care  if the director got the performance they wanted out of her  then she did the job she got hired to do. its not her fault the show is terrible. why should she feel bad about it  or even worse  why would you want to her pretend that it isn t a bad show
how was batman woke please explain
how exactly was the batman woke
well shes right. she got her cash so shes doin fineps shows just plain boring
why would she care if the show is good she didn t write it or direct it lol she just took a job   dont hate the player hate the game.
sorry I already have one you can give it to someone else
catwoman was going off on  evil white privelege  type stuff. wasn t too heavy handed tho so I got past it and loved the movie. watched it twice in theaters
the white privilege talk lol
@melonie mac go boom  Imean for real itseems like anytime a white character is played by anyone who isn t white its automatically woke.
if your passion isn t in the material. dont make the show. why was this even made
you have a very handsome kitty.... like mine better though.... im biased though.
I think she better care if this show sucks. she wont be hired for the next one. I truly loved a the good place but this show is just meh.. and she may be unemployable. oh well. no big loss I suppose.
I really hope there s no season 2 to she-hulk or Lord of the rings quite frankly every single youtuber making a video every single day about how bad the show sucks is getting very old time for a new subject something anything other than she hulk and Lord of the rings
thanos was right
if this show isn t for comic fans. or she hulk fans. or men at all.  are women watching it  do they like it  because my wife doesnt like it. she watches supernatural because the winchester brothers are hot. she watches murder mystery stuff.she said rings of power and she hulk are boring.  couldn t even get through 1 ep.
how is your life going   what an awful thing for a  star  to ask like that.  thats obviously a dig.
I am in favor of those people clapping back!!! to many people get away with saying stupid comments without being checked... I am a big guy  do you have any idea how many short  weak  scared boys have tried to step to me  knowing I couldn t lay them out and not be the villain even Jesus answer his accusers and called them out for their actions and judgments of others...if you dont want to have your feelings hurt  dont open your mouth!
should be happy with your work and not as dismissive. just saying.
you got your bag now  but your in a fickle career field so you may not get the bag next time...my life is not great  but I can get by...will your life still be great when you get passed up on your next job
number 1
well  she is right.  man-hating 4th gen feminists really didn t have a lot of movies shows aimed at them.  generally that was because its a small audience  but what the hey.
the batman is entertaining. the pattison movie where he was called batman was trash
how is this show man hating  I think this show may dislike certain male behavior like cat calling but how does it hate all men. Im a man and Im not feeling attacked whatsoever because I dont cat call
well ill never watch this actress better save her money cause I doubt anybody will ever watch whatever she tries in acts in again
no thats not what she said. she doesnt agree with you when it comes to your opinion about the show. this video title is bullshit.
ahuh.the approach to make this show is like mumble rap artists  they just make the bucks  dont care about the history of rap hip-hop and what its about. make the money and git done  frack everyone else who didnt git money.
why would she publicly talk ill about her employer  get a grip folks. actresses are people too. they are allowed to get frustrated from all the critique. move on with your life
I dont think she is capable to take a higher road... yo! her cup is full and she is proud of her selfish ignorance. werd!
youre a Christian  love cats  and is very pretty. wanna get married  also srry my pronouns aren t in my name. its clown clownself. only on tuesdays tho. every other day its tooth toothself.
a show made by women hating on man  but they re all sat there praising kevin feige. hail the master.
watch thethorias unlimitedreviews ofbatwoman   she hulk on youtube
love your content  but can you stop hitting your mic please  the niose is really irritating.
she is an actress who got paid to do a job why does she have to explain why the writers and producers have her shit to work with it
lol f
wow  great role model for young women. showing them that integrity doesnt mean shit.  feministmovement
they dont care because they knew from the start it would never get renewed  its just product for the sake of viewing so I see nothing wrong with doing a shit job for a shitshow
people really getting upset over being misgendered on twitter  talk about first world problems
the problem of woke movies is complete lack of creativity
!!people say! ! I wish actors left all dat at homewell  I totally disagree. I do love them spillin the beans. my gawd. I love gomcruises x. nicole kidmanfor 10 years...she has been...quiet on their...escapades. her and katie....go figure anyways....I saw dat bytch I love her...I do  eat a grass hopper...I hope....and...whoa...we would not have seen that years ago......
ive never heard of this woman before but she seems to think shes hot shit after one roll in a horrible show. also I bet shes about as big of a marvel fan as kevin smith was a fan of he man.
I like your cat very chunky
but if people dont like your shit no one s gonna hire you that doesnt make sense Ive never heard of her before now she s not brad pitt
hI coltrane!
you are so beautiful
they ruined any chance of titania being a good character why is she-hulk a comedy.  her stories comics are way more grittier.  how is this universe  616  it doesnt resemble it at all.  no t challa either
made for people this genre forgot   who is that exactly  women  because a lot of women are looking at this show and calling it the flaming bag of dogshit it is.
tatiana maslany cute doe... dont hate
is there a religion that wasn t man-made
she hulk actress doesnt care that the show sucks....which is precisely why the show sucks.
religion is man made too lol
10 13 how do you mis-gender a person !  if youre looking at a dude  and you address him as such  how are misgendering him !!! in my opinion  if you have a woman  using pronouns such as   he    him  or  they ...that is the true example of misgendering!
I see a little bit of feminism but over all I like the show. the last episode was fairly entertaining  if a bitsilly.
I understand its supposed to be a comedy but comedy has to be funny this is not funny
bro  well get you fired after we bond together bro larson already had a breakdown about being captain marvel still that nobody wants her to be lmao  yeah all the guys you were rude to more than half your fan base
wow.. who  are you !
did you just assume the gender of creation status of pronoun assignment by calling it manmade   Im sure it was maammade.
that actress   that bitsssh.. he ruin she hulk and she dont care about it... I hate disney even more right now.. I hope all disney future movie will sunk to oblivion...
I dont want to sound sexist  but I really dont even find her attractive. I feel like they found such a strange looking woman to portray her. its very short which is strange anyway cuz then she hopes and really tall  she s got a strange looking face  and just her whole delivery unless its just what she s trying to do for acting  her deliveries horrible she s just unlikable and all fronts. I d rather see you as she-hulk because you are far more attractive.
marvel insists upon itself. Ive always been a dc guy and even then not hung up on super heroes. but dc is just as much trash. itsaddens me that the industry is dead. but if u embrace the ppl that wont buy....
funny how your videos bash marvel and their employees on a regular basis. then ask them to take the high ground.. lmaooo
who
this will be the 4th channel to unsubsctibe. the guy took a dig at her about not getting a 2nd season and she responds with the great experience she had.God forbid the woman should be happy.but you jerks are just determined to be pissed no matter what.she didn t insult anyone.  you did that.f this
good thing she paid but how much is your dignity worth to be a part of such a cringe inducing show  this has managed to be worse than captain marvel and the terrible show with the teenage superhero. I do not even want to bother looking up what the property name is or was because hopefully it got cancelled.
every religion is man made
so many whiny crybabies hating lol
I didn t like batman.
absolutely unwatchable!
she s a terrible actress
she hulk was never number one. not even close. she provided a made up bullshit list.
this show is an ally mcbeal with superpowers wannabe.
its a sitcom based on a comic book character.   stop trying to treat any mcu show as high art.  at best is mindless entertainment.    all you are doing with your videos is getting people to watch it.   disney doesnt care why you watch just as long as they get eyes on screens.     its no different than any other big media company.     so pretty much what you are doing. how putting out videos about a show you dont like just to get views any different.   just dont watch or talk about it if dislike itso much.
I think she hulk is the worst series ever made   yep its that bad   rings of power is a God sent compared to she hulk   lol    the actress probably means number 1 worst show   lol    watching she hulk is like torture   please please end it with season one   please no season 2 please no more   I beg you   I want no more torture  lol
first  guess I wasn t first
hI to coltrane
its deeply wrong that you assume she is talking about women. you and I and your viewers know this genre of show is not one marvel studios nor perhaps any superhero content has reached in a while. a legal comedy. daredevil was more of a legal drama on netflix. this sex and the city inspired show is not one that has been commonplace with other live action superhero adaptations. those who like the show are the people she is talking about. I think its wrong and disingenuous and forcing your ur agenda by assuming she speaks for all female comic book fans assuming they ve just been forgotten until she hulk can along
she hulk is the worst marvel show ever
my pronouns are  your highness your excellence .respect my pronouns  bigot!
kitty
correct alphabet mob is not consistentbut your Bible is not consistent either.
this show is objectively bad. I have no problem with she-hulk at all. the writers are just fucking awful and should not touch another marvel project again. the hallmark channel should be hiring though...
women definitely like action just as much as men lmao u sound goofy
woke is literally slang for awake. dont be a victim of fascist propaganda.
you follow the king james Bible I bet since 90  of people do do you even know what the original older Bibles that king james didn t want to exist a human king dictated the current Bible and you trust it
