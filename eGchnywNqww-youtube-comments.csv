woke westerners  how dare you make the japanese into nothing but samuraI and ninjas! Im offended on behalf of people I dont even understand!japan    slaps roof of anime  live actions  children s shows  toothbrush boxes  public transportation art   this bad boy can fitso many ninja and samuraI in it.
true artist  game creators  movie creators  entertainment makers  etc  know how to have a genuine diverse cast without pushing diversity.
kiriko appears to be a miko  also known as a shrine maiden.  these were priestesses who tended and sometimes guarded the various shinto shrines located around japan.  they have a very large presence in anime and japanese culture in general.
the same people who rail against  cultural appropriation  are the ones who get mad when characters are stereotyped.  so which is acceptable   if an asian is portrayed as being  nerdy  or in this case a  ninja   its bad because its a stereotype.. but if they have a white guy play a ninja.. he s culturally appropriating ninjitsu.. so who is supposed to play the ninja
being woke is being in a state of perpetually offended.
overwatch  pays homage to japans fantastic culture.woke culture   and I took that personally .
I love how overwatch was woke  now getting called out by easily offended woke people. cant have stereotypes now can we  even if they re not negative stereotypes. guess they just want everyone to look generic and wear american clothes.
I bet the ones complaining dont even play overwatch.
kiriko is very cute  and I love the fox themes  the half-mask  the statues at the temple  the ghost-fox magic attack... looks like a fun addition to the cast
can we just agree that twitter woke people have terrible takes and should always be ignored  thank you!
zarya is an obvious stereotype of  mother russia   strong woman with a strong accent. it doesnt detract from her awesomeness  moreover  as a russian I am glad to be represented by her in such a big franchise.
Im totally off junk food and fast food  and Im working out regularly. thank you so much for believing in me  melonie
so  with her white top and red skirt analogue  while throwing around paper talismans... she s a shrine maiden miko in addition to being a ninja. now get this  in most japanese games where  shrine maiden   miko  is a character archetype  they re traditionally supports and healers...
I see no issue with kiriko. shes got alot of things going for her  shes cute  shes japanese  and everyone loves ninjas. the majority of players is going to love her
these people walk through life being miserable and triggered. they really do need mental help.
as a texan who is indeed a rancher cowgirl whatever you d like to call the western way of life. I love when they include those kinds of characters! and what s interesting is the  wild west  cowboys which is what that first one was kind of modeled after is interesting type of person who expiated in american history and still does to an extent. ninjas to me are similar as being something of the past that in its own still exists.
I love it when people tell me they re offended.  mostly so I cantell them that I dont care.
I love that her mom trained the shimada brothers along with kiriko. makes me want to see her mom on the battlefield with her badass katana.
solider 76 fits in with the americans because his backstory is he s essentially  captain america with a gun. he was given a serum to enhance his battle prowess. with him going dark after everyone thought he was dead gives off punisher vibes too.
stereotypes are only truly bad if they are stagnant and never grow. the point of stereotypes in storytelling is to use them as a base to build on. Im sure over the years  these characters will grow and evolve. especially within any story mode content or lore videos they produce
omg naruto has ninjas Im ofended
omg fullmetal alchemist has ninjas  Im offended....and inuyasha. double offended!
ninja scroll  how could they !
ninjas are everywhere in japan you just cant see them because they are ninjas. this is one of those rare occasions like seeing a snow leopard in their natural habitat where we can finally see footage of the illusive ninja throwing pieces of paper at people thatset them on fire. my stepdad set himself on fire once when we were at the pool  he poured lighter fluid on a ping pong ball and set it on fire with the bright idea of flinging it into the pool but instead set himself on fire and threw himself in the pool. it didn t work for him cause he wasn t a ninja.
ask a ninja needs to come back and answer some questions!
people who aren t ashamed of their history dont mind being stereo typed.
dont let them see the adventures of dr. mcninja
and to be fair  its really hard to find ninjas in anime or gaming nowadays. they re kinda rare gems to come by.
okay im gonna sound stupid but was does woke mean
@stardestroyer  the best way I can describe it is that it was once used as a word to identify people who were more socially conscious to injustices such as racism  sexism  homophobia  transphobia  etc. it was first coined within the black american community but became popularized through the internet.nowadays  right wingers use it ironically against the left to discredit attacks on them or their politics  often disingenuously. they like to say things such as  playing the race card  or  identity politics   another term they ve bastardized  or  the woke left mob  to achieve this.
I really wish this was posted every where for everyone to read all the time
@babylovespie  post it every chance you get. its the truth. pass it on.
youre right wish everyone knew this
I just didn t see how skin color is literally everything to these people
lol they re fake fans lol if they really wanna complain about kiriko  complain about how good her ult or healing or abilities in general are. its reminds me how some star wars  fans  complain about there not being enough inclusiveness in em. like yeah its galaxy far far away lol Im sure will see more aliens out there. its like if I went to space right now and traveled across the cosmos. like do you know how many native americans I d bump into ! idk lol but if I did and there s a lot of them and Im be pretty shocked  like my people can barely make a living off the reservations  I would ve never thought we d make it out of earth s orbit lol.
@wet stinky socks 2  bro the end of your comment had me dying lol
well if thats true we have too few  true  artists in our world today... or they just aren t being talked about
@redgambitt_  thank you for explaining that to me  I had no idea
no lie. studied the culture for years  been several times  speak the language. so much ninja samuraI themed media. I swear  its like cowboy stuff in 50s usa.
@earthborn alien  at most I think they are not being talked about. but I dont think searching them out and putting them in the spotlight is what we should do  some of them probably prefer the solitude and avoid the garbage drama. but they are out there.
exactly. as soon as I saw the talismans I was as like shrine maiden.
exactly  and with the fox theme she could be a miko for inari. https   en.m.wikipedia.org wikI inari_ kami
@travis asselta  yep  they even reference in her story that her grandmother worshipped the fox which is who she invokes her abilities from.
I was thinking onmyojI based on the talismans and fox theme  which isn t all that different. people saying all these characters are just ninja are kind of showing how uninformed they are of other cultures.
well  to be fair she is also a ninja. her grandmother s legacy is her miko side  her mother s is her ninja side. some of the old  some of the new.
I love her design in costume area her origin the cinematic and her abilities its not as annoying as baptiste which is amazing lol but nothing is bad about her
yeah and the hand sign is not only use by ninja  just because you only saw naruto use it doesnt mean only ninja use it  its based on mudra and is well known in japan that use in everyday from religious practice to dance  so it is more for a religious and sometimes martial artsedit  sorry for my bad english
yeah  but her  moves  are ninjutsu  or at least the naruto version of ninjutsu  which doesnt make sense for shrine maidens who would normally use talismans and glyphs to exorcise demons evil spirits. I think she is a ninja that cosplays as a miko  lol
@orion han  move in naruto is not ninja move  the real ninja is like genjI  do youreally think ninja can summon some spirit beast to fight for them  naruto is not a real ninja  they are beast summoner  or super natural being  it is a good show  but not ninja  think about what a ninja do in real  they collect info or assassination  all the work should be done in secret  so they wont use something this flashy even if they can  and kiriko summon toriI  the shrine gate which obviously religious  so she is a miko not a ninja  but the kunaI is indeed something ninja use  and if what you mean is how she moving or running  then I can see some similarities
this shrine is a refuge to those who find it.
what s worse is  after raging about cultural appropriation and stereotyping  they go hog wild and make characters with the worst stereotypes ever. ie. iceman is now gay  and they made him a flaming gay stereotype. limp wrist and all.
a gender fluid white lesbian trans I suppose
cats bro. cats. ninja cats.
never thought about it like this. crazy how hypocritical my generation has become
@monty  Imean  there are still people who wouldn t play mccree just because he was originally named after the blizzard employee who harassed women. like c mon  its a fictional character  has nothing to do with sexual harassment  yet twitter people still want him removed
raven   master raven from tekken  kimberly from sf6 bandeiras from kof leo and leeroy both use wushu and they arent chinese. no  it isnt offensive to japanese  asian ninjas . blizzard is just not creative.
bullies are victims who never stood up to their abusers to say  stop . they seek out  weaker  people  so they can continue the circle of violence and feel  powerful . perpetual victims are nothing but bullies.
well Imean have you ever stayed up too long that any social interaction pisses you off  thats pretty much how being woke is  they need to chill and maybe take a nap.
im so so offended by your comment! just because youre right doesnt mean u have to tell everyone!
Im only offended by you using the term woke to represent your fear of people who dont look like you.
@dan renewed  lmfao
the woke always eat each other alive  never smart to pander to them
stereotypes are stereotypes for a reason  people just didnt full them out of no where. stereotype jokes are also least offensive of race jokes. I have never thought of a stereotype as racist  in any way if its the truth
ehhh idk bro. I think this video was a stretch. I saw some some people talking about it but most of the talk Ive seen was about how its just kind of funny all the japanese characters are related ninjas  wasn t exactly an  sjw meltdown . also idt this lady completely understands what a stereotype is. road hog and junk arnt  australian stereotypes  they just took inspiration from an australian movie. also I dont really understand how her point was overwatch has this fleshed out world but her line for this fleshed out world is  I dont have to know who the characters go on dates with . this was a weird video for me. also dont understand how she didn t once mention the overwatch diversity calculator  thats an actually hilarious thing to point out and critisize
@coco crisp  diversity calculator
@coco crisp  Ive heard that the overwatch team were against that calculator thing.
@prime  Imean I hope to God they were  but its still something that will forever be tied to the game. people have reverse engineered the leaks of the original characters diversity chart and found where the newer ones would fall on it. its incredibly funny
overwatch was woke in the best way possible. not these companies that are making every character fit their agenda and drown out everyone else
of course they dont.  they dont spend their money on anything they complain about.  they just want their way because they want it.
they re nothing but fake fans   fake gamers  jason rose
just like people begging for diversity in comics. they dont buy the comics at all.
Imean most people dont even mention overwatch anymore lmao.
@blacklives orblackvotes  or watch the shows or movies
of course they dont and the character they are complaining about is so fun to play.
@brad miles  she really is though like Im going to start just using her all the time and I tell you its so fun taking down a diva with her too.
bro I love everything about overwatch  Imean except for baptiste lol but thats apart of the game  kiriko is an amazing character and the designs of all of the characters are amazing I love the stereotypes  why do people have to always bitch about things I dont get it
yeah they literally gave her a naruto headband with fox ears on it. the character is really fun to play too a very different style of support.
I love having her on my team while Im playing dva
in a world with twin dragon brothers  I think fox girl is pretty cool
@brad miles  its funny because blizzard said something along the lines of  we aren t going to try and make every character extremely different like in overwatch 1  and then makes all of their new characters very unique.
I cant wait to see her legendary skins in the events.even though none of us will be able to get them because they charge ridiculous amounts.
@pixelator  yeah  personally I prefer them being unique instead of just reskins of essentially the same character.
@angycaw  yea  Im still really annoyed that they removed the crate system to put in place the battle pass and store like every other game
@stardestroyer  a part of the game
thats usually the case with any woke whining about things like this in any game show movie etcetera.it pretty much never comes from any actual fans of the franchise in question.especially if its based on a book. they ve pretty much never read the source material.
all the characters are a bit over the top  they are designed that way. people on twitter are just too sensitive and look to be offended.  Im glad you enjoy zarya. Im not a fan of the over the top bodybuilder look she has but its her character and backstory. she was fun to play in ow1 if you had another good tank to work with and bubble weave.
wait till they announce she s a trans woman and holds world records  p she is the trans flag colors and so is the beam she shoots.
plus she can lift over 1000 pounds.  I think its 512 kg which I dont know what that is in pounds
@erica mcrae  is that a bad thing though
heck yes!
dude congratulations. Im still struggling with cutting out junk food from my diet. soda is quite literally the bane of my existence  yet Im still desperately clinging to it
@samwise nemo  switch to tea
getting rid of those is hard! took me a while to get  it right and be consistent. melonie has helped so many people with that.
@samwise nemo  I started getting kidney stones  associating it with extreme pain makes it easy to quit. I d recommend just not having any in the house. if its not available its easier to resist.
@samwise nemo  thank you so much  and I pray youre able to conquer your own dietary struggles. I believe in you  for what its worth
slam a gallon of water a day for a week straight. have some discipline. you can do it brah.
drinking 99  water for a long while will literally change your taste buds. so then cravings for sugar will drop. thats why I dont crave sweets anymore.
@samwise nemo  its really hard and Im currently going through the process myself. I finally got it down where I dont feel addicted to sodas and most foods. what I recommend is baby steps. literal...baby steps. start with the drinks  find things enjoyable but healthy and eventually move to water. then with food  I recommend trying plant based stuff that mimics the real thing and the move over to more healthy options. try having chicken a lot if you must have meat as its rich in protein. also make sure you try to eat only when you feel hungry. a good trick to try is to drink a lot of water when you feel hungry. if the hunger goes away  then it was only a feeling. if the hunger remains  then the hunger is real and you need to eat something.once you eventually conformed to a healthier diet  I recommend committing to some form of protein diet  especially if you plan to work out a lot. protein isn t just super good for you and your muscles and weight loss  but it also makes you feel fuller longer.I like to think food and drinks work like drugs. you need to ween yourself off it before you can develop a new healthy habit as going cold turkey always leads to bad consequences. once you nail the habit  maybe try water fasting once in a while to deny your body food. show that your body cant control you.
@samwise nemo  Im late but serious advice  switch to zevia if you like soda that much. its a good substitute. they have many different flavours. you might not end up liking it but its worth a try
thats awesome keep at it!!!!!
@black rabbit  thank you
@david low  no problem!
@samwise nemo  caffeine addiction sucks Ive had itsince I was a kid  but soda is horrible for you like other dude said try tea coffee for a natural form of it if youre having trouble cutting it entirely.
same impression I have. pretty unique for a miko who kinda looks energetic in battle due to her ninja play style.
apparently all these people never saw the inuyasha anime if they think she s a ninja just because she has kunaI which were actually a farming implement originally.
@brad miles  Im old  so I would reference silent m bius  because cyber psychic adventure.
blizzard s knowledge of japan comes exclusively from anime and hentai
@orion han  did you know there are asians working at blizzard  crazy I know
she s not even a ninja. she s a shrine maiden. her outfit is almost identical to kikyo s in the inuyasha anime.
@brad miles  you having to separate the two is just as bad as reading the complaints of the sjw in this video... lol.
@brad miles  she uses ninjitsu. she trained next to the shimadas
@fatjuggernaut  she s mostly a miko  that was what her grandmother trained her in. its where the fox spirit and  most of her abilities came from. her wall climb and kunaI is what her mom taught her. they reference it in the short with her mom not believing in the  magic fox spirit . she even says she stopped training with her mother long ago.
and a lot of the time their life is great  roof over their heads  caring parents  food on the table etc. but they have to be upset about skmething.
how do people live like that
exactly look at cassidy and ashe. cowboys and cowgirls and ranchers were a huge thing in the 1800s.the same go for samuraI  ninja and the like for japan. a good place to learn about it is a channel called gaijin goomba  I think I spelled it right  which goes over japanese culture in modern media whether its genuine from overwatch or the stealth mission in the boiling rock from avatar the last airbenderbut these kinds of people have been around for at least a century and served an important role in the time they lived. like for example I believe samuraI protected their local Lords and fought for them
kiriko looks to me to be a shrine maiden or miko. her attire as well as her healing ability throws magical ofuda. a traditional shrine talisman that you would place in your home or kept on you as a blessing. they are complaining and not even knowing what they are looking at.
I dont really care for the game itself  but I love watching overwatch s animated shorts  and kiriko s is probably one of my favorites. I think the overall design is pretty great  and the context of her fox mask is even better when you ve watched her short. man  why cant people just enjoy the fun colorful characters
I dont simp. I simply wait for her fan  art
kiriko feels like child of ahrI and d va combined  which is an honest compliment.still cant wait for cute fan art of her!!!
theres nothing wrong with stereotyping its part of human nature.
I want more melonie mac videos. feel good  for you are  in demand . enjoy your success while it lasts girl.
most characters in most fighting games are stereotypes. japanese games  anime  manga  etc feature cultural stereotype characters- ninja  samuraI  miko  shinigamI  etc. suddenly now its a problem  ppl are just looking for stuff to complain about.
Im just gonna drown them out with kiriko s theme goes that goes hard af.
I love kiriko. well done.
she s literally everything a man wants.feminists  she s problematic!
kiriko  she comes more across with a shrine maiden vibe. the variation on shrine maiden outfit  maybe  the talisman s and sprit wolf fox  she looks cool. Imain tanks so this doesnt affect my top 3 picks. I just need to know how to deal with her on the battlefield.
just like when  the simpsons  was actually funny  all the characters were common stereotypes --- and it worked!
at this point  I think blizzard cantell the perpetual victims to f-off and they would gain customers.
she s cute and looks interesting to play. I probably still wont be playing  but I hope you enjoy it. Im sad Im gonna miss your game time stream tomorrow since I have to be on a plane for work    go steelers.
I dont see how thats a bad thing. more like   why do you want this to be a bad thing
Ive never played overwatch  but Ive wanted too. so  Imay have to try it. I dont understand why it materials who the character prefers. what does that have to do with game play  I hope if you play  you have fun with kiriko. I enjoy seeing these videos. enjoy your day melonie!
kiriko is more of a miko than a ninja. and her cinematic was awesome
art is art if you change it to fit other peoples visions and not yours  it is no longer your art.
junkrat main  I like playing cute characters.me  I have questions...
kiriko is my favourite new character. I often play support because most people who play overwatch suck at protecting the team. so that is what I do. kiriko is cute and kills with head shots whilst healing the group.
tis simply the way of the online gentleman. anything less would be unacceptable.
ah  I see your a man of culture as well
rule34 already has a ton  most if it is meh quality but some is good.
haha
yeah its only when you take it out of its proper place that its a problem
I agree. it only unacceptable if you are using a stereotype in a harmful degrading matter. would you agree
you are correct she is a miko. her outfit outsie of the headband is almost an exact copy of kikyo from inuyasha who was a shrine maiden.
okay let me explain why you shouldn t play the game in as few bulletpoints as I can. 1. its woke. its played by woke crybabies. 2. it caters to terrible players which is why they nerf every character whenever people get good at them.3. blizzard forces you to play the meta because it caters to loser crybabies.
the points by that other guy aren t so much on the gameplay. tbh the game used to be pretty fun back in the day. first 2 years were solid but the prime of overwatch has passed unfortunately. overwatch 2 is gonna be free to play if you just wanna hold out for that when it launches
@gurtius maximus  1  not really true  play any quickplay game and see the banter that gets thrown around. about as far from woke as you can get.  it can make leagues look woke.   2  they dont nerf based off bad players  nerfs come from the pros in overwatch league take example junker queen  in the last tournament only tank played was her because she is new and overpowered. they after nerfed her   are you saying the pro s are bad players 3  you dont have to play the  meta  unless  your  in gm or higher. you can literally push to diamond and masters being a one trick on any character. plenty of people have done it. people have done unranked to gm on every character in a season before.none of your points are remotely true. I  d guess you dont have much experience with the game if you are making those claims.
@famishedyoshi  the points he is making aren t even true remotely.
dont listen to the two comments below you  play the game  its free now anyway  and make your own opinion.
@gurtius maximus  how is this game woke tho
@brad miles  agree with you bro
@rengoku  I guess he means because some of the characters are gay or whatever. I could care less about what they put in the characters bio s as long as they are fun to play.
hey  Im a new player  not woke at all   started playing the day after launch  got all characters unlocked  3 from competitive unlocked and 27 on the battle pass  the game is a blast and when they add the pve its gonna be a great package  I was always intimidated by the first game as I didn t t get it at launch and hate jumping in these types of games mid cycle  so this soft reset is a great starting point!
@jonathan guest  now thats great to hear
dont forget the korean is stereotyped as a gamer and the russian is a buff woman. personally I think the overwatch characters lack personality especially compared to team fortress or apex but if people like the characters  whatever
playing ow right now and as a half japanese  I love what they did.
she is so freaking cute and packs a fucking punch those kunaI hurt
idk how s that a problem. yes she s a ninja. but she s also the youngest meaning she s more fluent in english  have more knowledge in both her culture and pop culture. so all the stereotypical aspects of hanzo and genjI are almost gone having that honorable personality with bad english. you make valid points  great video! im definitely going to main kiriko
jiminy Christmas are woke people unhinged.  cant have anything nice.  btw...love the gojira kanjI tattoo.
I haven t watched the trailer  just the stuff shown in this. kiriko isn t a ninja  she s an onmyojImagician. does she use some ninja tools  yes. but using the talismans and being a support  onmyo to a t. says a lot about them that they see japanese and say ninja.
I agree kiriko looks like a cool character gives me a vibe of yuffie in final fantasy 7. makes me what to get back and play some overwatch when it was good back then. we will see in october how the squeal plays.
I would like to see how those critics would design a recognizable human character with specific traits while avoiding stereotypes and cultural inspiration.
the stereotype that always bugged me in overwatch was tracer having an accent straight out of a dick van dyke movie.over the top fake english accents like that are like nails on a chalkboard.but...she was still a fun character to play as  zen was still my main though
I really love the look of kiriko!
you had me at spirit fox.  foxes freaking rock.
had a long week this weekend I am playing through assassin s creed ezio collection on the switch and hope your doing well so far melonie and I hope you kept up with the gaming news this past week.
I never see anyone complain about her
to me kiriko is more of a shino priestess than a  ninja.
we cant have nice things because of these people
says   I like playing cute characters.  mains junkrat  oookayyy
I dont play overwatch  but looking from the aesthetics alone  yeah  she looks pretty cute. I can see how she d appeal to a lot of ppl. though  I got one question  does all characters in overwatch have gigantic hands  cause hey  if kiriko slapped someone  looks like it d be a straight-to-the-icu situation.
just subscribed  watch several of your videos. I like the way you think
the funniest part  like others have said  is that japan treats ninjas and samuraI like that. way more than we do with cowboys here in the us outside of that time of the westerner film boom
I tried playing her for the first time  Im use to being a reaper genjImain  so its pretty funky  dont understand her card attack  her teleport is interesting  haven t used her ultimate yet.
the only champion that has personality is bastion. and he doesnt even talk. he just whirs.
@jubeI yagami  the hero we all need
she s actually a miko or shrine maiden. look at her outfit  it is almost a direct copy of kikyo from inuyasha.
@brad miles  its a little bit of all three  which is entirely reasonable. miko were often trained as onmyo to banish yokaI that could threaten the shrine or the people in the surrounding areas. ninja  as the premier spies of the region  were useful to have in positions that deal with large groups of people.
@evilmandrake  Im just basing off what is in her origin short and her skins ingame.
@brad miles  like I said  youre not wrong. blizzard  at least in this regard  is still good at what they do. very few of the characters are just based on just one thing. even soldier 76  the entire joke being  generic call of duty  man has deeper influences.
agreed  she uses magic bound to paper and has an inarI familiar.
shrine maiden which is a miko. if the people complaining bothered to watch her short origin short  they go over it. she visits the shrine of the fox spirit with her grandmother who takes care of the shrine.
thank you so much
with it potentially being free to play and my skins and stuff transfer over  Im definitely hopping back in. even though Im not happy with blizzard for their leadership and culture at the company  Im on their side in this case. they did bring this upon themselves for pandering to this type of crowd. but if I were them  I wouldn t change anything about the character or the lore. at the end of the day  its never enough for them. I hope they stick to their guns on this character.
as a new zealander  this was the first time I d heard of our  mad max characters  steryotype .
I like playing cute characters  - junkrat main
the most important thing is diversity in gameplay. the 3 are all ninjas but they are complete different hanzo is a patient precise sniper  genjI is a super mobile dps   kiriko is a backline support. all are different in their own way.
as a japanese man and showing images of kiriko genjI and hanzo to my japanese parents. nobody is offended at all.anyone being butthurt for us has to just drop the act  be offended when there s a reason to be offended  not cuz of some simple shit like  oh the japanese characters are ninjas  ontop of that hanzo isn t even technically a  ninja  he s a ky d ka an archer basically  demonstrating how thought was put into this complaint
I love the fact thatsome of us will never accept changing the name of mccree
kiriko is easily taking over my choice of healer to pick lol.
I dropped ow a couple years back cuz of the massive amount of pandering they were doing. the mccree name change was the straw that broke the camels back. your enthusiasm for the game is the closest thing to fomo Ive experienced for ow
I 100  agree. honestly if you look at her backstory she s a support hero who also kicks butt. she s a combination of the spiritual training from her grandmother and her physical combat training from her mother. so she can kick butt and protect people. we even see her put a healing ofuda on the girl s grandfather after he got shot. thatsaved his life side note though he might wanna make sure that bullet isn t still in there at an emergency room as for gay characters there s only two confirmed  as of  me typing this on saturday october 15  2022   tracer and soldier 76. actually both were revealed that way outside of the game.  tracer early on in a comic showing her and her gf emily at Christmas time. and soldier 76 in a story  I think it takes place around the time of the overwatch recall .  he and ana are talking and ana mentioned jack s ex vincent and about how he should check in on him.  soldier says vincent is married now and he couldn t give his ex the kind of life he wanted. I think there s actually a picture of them in the story or he s looking at it or something  been awhile since I read it
I was a little skeptical from your title but idk shit about overwatch but me and all my friends just got into it this week we are loving the game play I love kiriko cinematic trailer and Im loving your opinions so boom new sub for you keep it up!!!!
as someone who went through miko training in my youth  I legitimately dont see how this is meant to be offensive  I legitimately love kirikos design and execution.
you would do such a good cosplay of kiriko
thank you for pulling up the facts!!!
I call her more of a shrine maiden just from the outfit  tailmans and spirit fox she has with a side of throwing knives. but thats just me. I belive I head her call the fox a kitsune too in game but I could be wrong
I always thought mccree was awesome looking. stereotypes can be great in satire or creating something really cool out of it. in the case for mccree  it makes me think of red dead redemption. a game that didn t need to exist but Im grateful it does  same for even grand theft auto since Im at it. as an american myself  I dont feel offended at all. how he is makes me wanna play him.
so what if they are built on stereotypes  kiriko taking inspiration from shrine maiden is great. and its cool that they have minI groups like shimada bros and now kiriko which perfectly fits in that noone even complains and junkrat squad  and also ree and ash
being a junkrat main is synonymous with having no friends
kiriko looks like a mix of a ninja and an omyoujI  please correct me on the spelling or the term if Im wrong  or a sorceress seeing how she uses magic and talismans. nothing wrong with mixing ideas. I dont know why  people  had to find things to complain.
2 weeks later a lot of ppl are playing this character and saying they like her. the small   of ppl that complained probably never even played the game
yeah  youre right. kiriko does have a good design
except she s not a ninja at all  she s a shrine maiden. they establish that during her origin short. they literally show her going to the fox shrine with her grandmother.
honestly  I just dont really like kirikos design cuz I just find her.....kinda boring compared to genjI and hanzo.
he ll always be mccree  only people who are associated with ow league who stream call him cassidy out of fear. even ml7 calls him mccree still half the time.
im sorry but people who got mad at the name change have no right to call people sensitive
@astolfo  who said anything sensitive.
@sir clueless  guess you haven t seen the same people as me then
@sir clueless  and I wasn t saying you called anyone sensitive
@astolfo  my bad man. its early where Im at.
why wouldn t blizzard change mcrees name when he is named after a sex offender
pretty sure she is a miko aka a shrine maiden based on her outfit being almost an exact copy of kikyo from inuyasha. also in her backstory vid they show her at the shrine being introduced to the fox spirit by her grandmother who took care of the shrine.
an onmyojI is more of a sorcerer or an exorcist  miko or shrine maidens are a bit different. I wish I could give a better example about how their different but in all honesty my knowledge is limited on the subject
finally a chick who plays this game who isn t a professional victim. its a refreshing voice from all the fake tgirl voices  and annoying children who complain about everything. I see your parents raised you right. I look forward to watching more of your content
cant wait for blizzard to release the next japanese characters  the manga artist and the drift racer.
man who ever thought woke people can get mad when every male likes this female character who acts like a ninja and there will be lot of people doing naruto reference.  specially when she dod those hand signs Imean I like her Imight use her specially if she also speaks half japanese. also do these woke people ever visit the library or talk to a japanese person about the history of ninja s and where they come from. also I hear the wolf can heal and it also looks cute I wonder if its a female wolf. also ladies Im a man writing this by the way nice to meet yha.
they always need a dragon to slay
it would have been hilarious if they got someone similar to kenichI smith in terms of character stereotype lol
likes playing cute characters  mains junkrat
the funny thing is kirikos clothing is based of shrine maidens  not a ninja. and on the overwatch fandom itsays kiriko is a shrine caretaker under occupation.
haven t played kiriko yet but just started playing meI  she s awesome. definitely the cutest character.
I cant recall the last time I heard anything about a new character getting added to overwatch. Im surprised everyone isn t excited just to have a new character.
I dont even see the  hate  about kiriko. if anything  I can just brush it off as something a person or maybe two  said was like the other japanese characters  fantasy  honor  etc.  and people read that and assumed everyone was mad about it. Imean it fits with the fellow cliche d characters. stereotypes would imply lies or indirect mockery or distaste. another reason I can brush this off as people just trying to find a reason to argue with someone not liking a character s design  which so far  most of had this song and dance. its only kiriko s turn.
honestly my biggest issue with kiriko  as someone who likes making character designs  is thatshe s.... honestly kinda boring visually  like  ow characters have this thing where they mix their place of origins aesthetics with futuristic technology for some memorable designs. to me  the way they use the aesthetics was what made the character designs.in kirikos case  it feels like they are trying really  really hard to make me notice she s japanese. like  they really dont want me to mistaken her for anything but japanese. it just feels....odd.
exactly what did they want the character to be  I notice a lot of crying about what she is but nobody has the stones to suggest something else because they know that no matter what is put forward  they eat their own and they are going to get just as wrecked for standing out.also  my question is why isn t everything ninjas  ninjas freaking rule.
they get fake offended over fictional characters that dont exist in real life
thank you! the name change thing was superficial and just dumb and mccree is freaking mccree!!!
nice video haha when the woke eat themselves too funny. also do youbhsve a video behind your tattoos  Ive always been intrigued by them since youre a nice Christian girl. reason why I find that unique is tattoos are typically connected to rebels or perhaps youre just a fan of art
melonie ! the last video I watched in your channel was your tomb raider 2 play through so long ago.glad youre still shining
dude I always wanted to play as fox yes!  think it would be cooler if kitsune mask were full mask .agree with u
she s a blast to play
she looks more like a shinto shrine maiden with the paper talismans  red and white   the fox spirit.
blizzard made their bed  now they can sleep in it
so.... youre playing satan  cool....I guess
@chris riley  so  Ive been told. really hanzo  junkrat  pharah are worst. little bastards
@d quinn  hanzo hasn t really been bad since his scatter arrow was replaced.junkrat can be annoying but he s not too hard to killpharah I ll agree with is a nuisance especially in your back line.if youreally wanna talk awful overwatch 1 bastion  torb on attack when youre on defense  and symmetra....fucking symmetra I hate her so much
@chris riley  hanzo had been glitched to where his arrowhead was scanning like it was the size of a melon. so infuriating seeing a hanzo quick shoot me barely even aiming
@d quinn  what do you mean  size of a melon
there are 3 with ow2 launch. soujurn who is a dps  junker queen who is a tank  and kiriko who is a support.
cuz then it d get boring fast
she is  people didn t watch her intro origins short which is 2 minutes long. they go to the shrine during it.
I want a muay thaI support character so I can watch the woke freak out then I can say  Im thai. this is cool. shut up
what do you think about saints row s disaster reboot  do you think if it flop it will convince embracer to put pressure on crystal dynamite to not mess up the next tomb raider game
you are a good person.
I never played overwatch but overwatch 2 came out for free and I love it I watched several overwatch origin and backstory vids my main is d va love her this game is one of the most diverse games out here  also if u dont mind ill love to play a few matches with u if u want that this
7 14 Im craving strawberry donuts
great video melonie!
why are all your japanese characters ninjas !  ninjas are fun  games are supposed to be fun. I would also root for a samuraI  yakuza  or sumo  all would be fun.
13 52 one of the most cursed things Ive ever seen
anyone who isn t race obsessed would have either never noticed  or never cared that  every japanese character is a ninja . I have a feeling there s a comedy sketch somewhere about blizzards wheel of sexuality  when it lands on straight.
I loved the  first overwatch. because of how different the game was. as a fps gamer. overwatch was unique. no bs just fun   but now everything has to have an agenda
its not just the characters that are stereotypes  its like all the maps too lmao I feel like blizzard did no research on the countries and just used popular shared thinking instead
junker queen is literally just jinx from league of legends. Im surprised they could get away with that character.
from what I remember  ninja is a job  samuraI is a caste. a samuraI can be a ninja.
if we wanna be offended for japanese ppl  we should be offended at the fact genjI hasn t been meta in 6 years due to insane nerfs
only problem I have with her design is her arms. its okay to have toned arms and small arms but hers are like animated sticks
id say kiriko looks more like a shrine maiden than a ninja but eother way she looks kickass
for the record  thatsaloon is part of a movie set  not an actual saloon.but im sure there is a saloon somewhere in ow lol
she s a ninja!  kiriko s a miko shrine maiden  though
she s another ninja! are shrine maidens just... ninjas then  cause last I checked- she was also trained as a shrine maiden.
oh  man  junkrat is where its at. melonie knows. thatsaid  definitely giving kiriko a try and not getting those online idiots get to me.
the gameplay was alright but there was alot of cringey stuff in it.
its not done spinning.  its been there for five minutes. dude creeps up and starts blowing on the wheel...
I thought overwatch only had 2 gay characters
Imean she trained with genjI and hanzo so its not wrong just not entirely right either.
Imean she s both as from her talismans and outfit and from the fact thatshe trained with genjI and hanzo as kids.
everything is coming up explodey.
I dont know if I would call their character design that organic.... didn t activision blizzard have some controversy over being related to   possibly using a diversity scale for hero creation in which characters needed to be diverse in terms of sexual orientation  ethnicity  gender identity  ability  etc
she not a ninja  she s a mystic character  more specifically a kitsune miko  her weapons are paper talismans.she may be stereotypical character  but she is not a ninjafrom 3 japanese characters  there is only one ninja and its genjI  hanzo is an archer bowman and kiriko is a miko shrine maiden
nice job mel
kiriko is the daughter of the woman who trained hanzo and genjI from lore Ive seen so thats why she s a ninja
Im glad your calling this sort of thing out.
I guess its cause of shipping that companies come out of nowhere to announce a character s sexuality. I love shipping characters no mather their sexuality  so a canonical definition makes no difference. there s no reason to specify specially in games like this with a lot of characters and a huge shipping community.
from what Ive heard of the lore  genjI  hanzo and kiriko all learnt the ways of combat from kiriko s mom back when she was still a combat trainer in the shimada clan. hence you can see some similarities in their combat  eg. all can wall climb . however thats where their similarities end. looking at their individual fight styles  the 3 characters were given developed diverse styles  depending on their experiences in the lore  rather than just  ninja  that these  woke people  claim. take hanzo who took up the leadership of the shimada clan  his fight style leans more towards that of a samuraI  who were considered noble leaders in feudal japanese culture . in game he takes more of a dps character sniping and killing everything in his sight  doesnt have to be in his sight if he ults . genjI on the other hand had managed to survive being murded by hanzo and was hiding his identity  until the events of  dragons  cinematographic vid  and develops a more stealthy approach going with a full ninja style . in game he mainly kills up close then run away as a speedy character  and is often used to kill the back line. kiriko who also learns inherits spirit abilities from her grandmother as well  develops her abilities to be more of a typical traditional japanese priestess  with her healing protection abilities  albeit also having ninja-like combat abilities as well . saying they re all just  ninja  is like looking at 3 potato dishes and calling it all just potato when it could be fries  mashed potato or potato chips crisps which is quite different from one another depending on the texture.
she s a ninja.
I do find itstrange thatsocieties weird trends using slang words which could be the exact same word like simp use it as a slang. or take another word like dupe which has nothing to do with duplicate but in their eyes its short for duplicate . or take the word wife make a slang japanese word waifu for wife even though its not even a real word for wife. or taking the word meta and completely destroy what it means which means beyond versus m.e.t.a most effective or efficient tactics available.
I feel like at this point people just make up things to be offended at just for the clout.
junker queen is and awesome character design. I want a business suitskin for her.
I feel like they tried to make itso you could vaguely guess where the characters are from at a glance by using general stereotypes. even soldier 76 is primarily red white and blue in a leather jacket with a rifle. he s essentially a color coded american action movie hero.
these same fans were offended by the velma multiverses issue
haven t seen a single soul complaining about kiriko. might have to do something with me being off twitter for the majority of this year. most players in game actually like her  including me.
getting offended about overwatch is like complaining that the pride flag doesnt have enough colors.
twitter  omg I cant believe kiriko s a ninja so she s walking stereotype ewwwwwwwme  wait until they hear about the tf2 mercenaries being literally stereotypical xd
team ninja added pronouns to their new game and I feel that also is going to bite em in the  redacted .
two words   insecurity intensifies !
she s a shrine maiden with kitsune powers  how is that anything like a ninja.
10 05 its totally possible
if I were to play devil s advocate I d argue they have some  ninja adjacent  parts of their toolkit  but youre bang on.
Imean  all three are ninjas to some degree as they all had the same training before splitting up and doing their own things. so  its not wrong just not entirely right either.
he s captain america with a gun. they used a super soldier serum on him.
exactly she is a miko whose grandmother looked after the fox shrine  she is the one who introduces kiriko to the spirit and teaches her. its all in the origin short.
I d like a handy list of things the cultists aren t offended by.I have a feeling its very  very short and therefore easy to remember.
she s a foxy shrine maiden who lives in the hills of mt. fujI with yoshimitsu and his band of merry manji. her rival is kunimitsu  that little sly  thieving kitsune. who will win yoshI s love in this vicious triangle of a predicament. find out next week on  my slice of life  seinen edition.
so is this about people who arent japanese got offended but those who are  arent offended. thats crazy
they re mad at this but they werent mad that at the fact that one of the african characters was reworked to literally chuck spears... they get mad at the weirdest things
8 25 action ichI knows the internet lol
canon ships never stopped me from shipping boys with other boys in my head  didn t harass the creators to make my ship canon either  the entitlement of people nowadays
she s a shinto ninja priestess with a fox spirit  how much more anime can you get
she s a konoichI  female ninja  and its cole cassidy
wait... so this character is actually a miko with ninjutsu talents.  why dont they call her a miko instead of ninja   cuz blizzard doesnt think westerners would understand what one was
twitter is just looking for stuff to get mad at
white dad soldier is my favorite skin. this is speaking from the standpoint of a cargo shorts and socks with my birkenstocks wearing white dad myself.
I dont get it what s wrong with having 3 japanese ninjas on the game lmaooo
I glossed over the title too fast  and thought thatsaid kirito.
also been playing iw since the start  grinded to top 500 as dva back in the day and prided myself for getting to the 16th spot in na out of all dvas. that being said in all my years Ive seen plenty complaining over the smallest things. let the girl be japanese Jesus Christ.
hImelonie I just wanted stop by sayI hope your enjoying your weekend thus far takecare melonie
I understand why the new character is a magic ninja girl  because if she were an office lady she would get squished running around in an action adventure combat game.  what else would she be
hanzo and genjI were originally one character  so thats why they re both ninja.
the kiriko trailer was quite woke imho  and they re still offended!
these people who complain have nothing going on in their life and just want to complain at something that isn t that big of a deal. they would still complain about the littlest thing on any character that came out and not even look at the lore. even though I am not a blizzard fan anymore overwatch had a good story with a diverse cast and they did not make it about their color at first. then they went woke and started pandering to the sjw s.
people will complain about everything in existence   and always will   somebody is always offended   sometimes and often by the stupidest shit   cause these kinds of people are just plain idiotic and just want to complain about something !
the list page would probably be blank  to be honest.
@max  yeah its just sad that they go looking for things to be offended by. it creeps me out because its a sign of a paranoid mind  if you ask me. paranoia stemming from an obsession with political correctness  and they stuff it into everything.
Ive called her kirito out of habit a few times myself.
a cyborg  an athlete  a soldier  maybe a scientist who made some wicked combat stimms or a power frame hidden under their clothes
@@user-fb4rw1yi6w  genjI is a cyborg  and sojourn just released is cyborg and soldier.  it would be copy copy copy.  her main point is being a magic healer.  the ninja part explains her athletics  because her tie in was her mom trained genjI and hanzo.  I think it would be more kewl for her to be a rival clan or independent agent  but we get what we get.  Im more askance at 20 plus old genjI apparently pulling around with an un related tween slash young teen girl.  playboy genjI as he is established.   yeah the optics are not great.  as it is   being a sort of shrine maiden is not the worst trope.
I wonder if kiriko can make it to the end of the year without being made into an lgbt character.
just 1 nitpick  ash is more an wild west outlaw than a cowgirl. just pointing that one out.but yeah  I agree with you on the junker queen.....a bit disappointed in her design  I thought her design would be a bit more mad max over the top  hell her epic skins are basically rare skin recolors with a very small add on or a small change to her default armor apart from the chromatic differenceas for kiriko.....at her reveal I felt her design was a lil bit cringy if cute....then I saw her short.....yeah  I love her nowalso  check out dislyte if you want to see another highly diverse videogame cast with awesome designs
44 days til  halloween
its that bad  Imean she looks fine as a character. I d need to try out her kit though
Im all about asian girls  so you know I ll love her  .  hell  dva was my favorite before now.
if you want to see the best of soldier 76 s dad skin  watch raddeken videos. guy is a hard core  spawn camping troll.
I dont mind stereotypes when they re done right. they re supposed to be a character  theme  of a sort  if you get me like its not what makes them who they are as a person  but its the culture they grew up in and are influenced by. or maybe even just something they themselves find inspirational.like  I wouldn t mind seeing a new swedish character who s styled after a viking or a carolean.those aren t offensive things. they re a badass part of my peoples  heritage that Im proud of.I imagine that japanese folks think something similair about characters styled after shinobI  samuraI and mikos.what the feminists and woke cultists usually do wrong with representation is that they slap a race  ethnicity  gender  sexuality or what have you on a character and present that character as if their entire personailty is built on that.which is dumb  because people dont work like that in the first place. it also feels forced and inorganic.not to mention that their idea of what those things are are usually confining or outright offensive to the things they re trying to represent.also  no one has the right to be offended on someone elses behalf. that  in and of itself  usually borders on offensive.
huh. I thought for sure you were going to say they were upset kiriko looks white lol
twitter is a hell hole. I honestly dig it. I dont really mind the japanese representation being samurais. its referencing the country s culture and its relevant to the universe s lore of a clan that follows traditional methods instead of firearms  which is relevant to the japanese history.most people dig the character. its just always the loud minority on twitter. some people might even joke about it but still like the character
I never noticed the japanese  Godzilla  on your arm there  noice.
I just wish kiriko was a dps with a kit that fit the short more  she is sooooo lackluster as a support
she s not even a ninja.  trained in ninjutsu... sure.  ninja   no  she s a fox priestess.
people really can not enjoy anything anymore.
why does she have an american accent  genjI and hanzo both have japanese accents when they speak in english  so why doesnt kiriko
I kinda like kiriko
the new hero is super sick!!! I really dont see how there is a issue with this... ninja s are dope as fuck. people are really reaching with this holy shit xd
tbf  I wouldn t have minded seeing someone who isn t a ninja  but thats because I want to see a beefy shogun tank character with a huge ass odachI or something  or maybe a gundam-esque omnic hero referencing japan s tech.
that person has  they he  in his twitter bio  so  its not surprising his are getting offended over something like this and let s not overlook the catboy thing in his bio too.
Imean how many people go the route to become a warrior. not a lot of people go into combat without combat abilities with the exception of mei
when they made soldier gay is when I started noticing the trend of pandering to hide their big mistakes.
she is really fun if you play her right. check out ml7 s guide for her. it goes over playstyle and I found it helpful.
first  they complained that a pose lets you see tracer s butt. then the complained that a chinese new year costume for meI doesnt make her look fat enough. then  they complained that d. va gets a cop costume. then they complained thatsigma is a white guy! now  they re mad that there s a female japanese ninja. these people are annoying!
kiriko is the only reason Im even interested in overwatch 2. she s just overwatch s take on the kitsune myth.
the terminally online woke mob are miserable. I d hate to be so angry all the time.
how many japanese characters are they gonna add though
ninja was a role of samurais  a kind of expertise cause they were not good at combat.
what s hilarious to me the most is kiriko isn t really even a ninja  she s more like a miko priestess or onmyojI who decided to take up parkour. her outfit is straight up just modernized miko gear and her whole gameplay is playing support and cleansing people like an onmyojI is meant to do  so people calling her a ninja is lowkey a little racist cause they re ignoring a very important cultural facet of japan.which  y know  not shocking from these kinds of people.
overwatch player here  unfortunately blizzard has attempted to appease to the woke for too long  kind of like h3h3  and now get cancelled often for not upholding thatstandard high enough. happens to companies and youtubers alike.
I thought hanzo was a samurai.
the only time I care about someone s preference is when the game devs change it 30 times
heh you could have come away with saying it isn t modern day contemporary and been fine.  it has cowboys and saloons  yes two things that do exist today believe it or not. though let s be fair that was a set in hollywood you were pointing at off the set of a western lol.
hanzo goes from samuraI to salary man  junk-rat main here to!here we go steelers!here we go!1-2 isn t a good start but its still early in the season!
why haven t they released the female robot featured in ashe s intro cutscene talking to mccree and I dont really care when they change mccree s name   plus the plandemic scamdemic made me despise ninjas because of the mask situation from the scamdemic though as a konuichI she s nice  so I dont have a problem with her I just no longer about anything that virtue signals the woke message.
this video was basically made for an excuse to simp on the new character
all the ethnically white characters whose designs are based off of stereotypes of their nationalities mcree and ashe- american outlaws from the old westsoldier 76- retired american special forces soldier turned vigilantetracer- spunky british girlwidowmaker- french femfatalzarya- big strong russianjunkrat and roadhog- cooky mad max themed australiansmercy- a swiss pacifist doctorreinhardt- tall  buff german knight with blonde hair and blue eyes t rbjorn- blode swedish viking dwarf with a braided beard and missing an eyebrigette- swedish shield maidenmoira- irish ginger  wouldn t count if she wasn t the only one
one thing I gotta say. what d they expect
ow2 looks great  the characters  new looks are good as well but....Im not giving blizzard my phone number so thats a pass for me.
the fact that white people get mad about this makes me wanna laugh. I saw a video of a white guy in traditional mexican clothing ask other white people what they thought  all their answer where.  its wrong  or  your appropriating a culture.  he asked people in the mexican part of town and they loved it. they found it flattering and very comforting to see that they accept them as a culture.
my problem with kiriko is thatshe sounds american
first off....yes kiriko fits into hanzo and genjis backstories....her mother and grandmother trained the yamatas sons. secondly.. kiriko is not a ninja...she is a priestess...ofcourse she would know the ninja wallrun...she grew up around the yamata clan.
someone at blizzard has been playing a lot of pocky   rocky  itseems...
yep there was a lot of cross play between the two which is funny given in media the whole portrayal of them being enemies. shinobI were just spies and scouts. they went behind enemy lines to gather intel or sabotage.
you are right  if they bothered to watch her little 2 minute origins intro they d see her grandmother took care of the fox shrine and introduced her to the spirit  teaching her the ways of a miko or shrine maiden.
@brad miles  this exactly
they did release her like a year ago. that is echo. you must not of played in years.
I really dislike how woke has become this big umbrella derogatory term. on topic  while I get why people could take offense to yet another ninja it really isnt that big of a deal. and to be honest kiriko reminded me more of a demon hunting miko like kikyo from the inuyasha franchise then a ninja.
what are they expecting -- an overworked  balding salaryman in a sebiro  a barely clothed sumo wrestler  a tsundere waifu  Ive spent a lot of time in japan  ninjas saturate the entertainment market there. the only difference is they say  shinobI .  ninja  is based on the chinese pronunciation of the kanjI and is used by foreigners
sooo....the fact that  woke  was not a mainstream word used when overwatch 1 came out. also its weird having someone talk about overwatch lore who doesnt know the lore  itshows  but then again gotta cash in on what s trending even if you have no idea of what youre talking about.
I think your thinking of symmetra as the autistic one  they added that to her lore I think. sadly due to how much blizzard shoe horned all the relationships into a game bout shooting ppl  fighting with ppl to get on payloads. I kinda dont care for overwatch anymore.
kiriko does remind me of a character from paladins though lol
Ive always found it weird when anything comes to race or culture the majority of complaints come from the people who are not that race or do not come from that culture.
are fans actually angry about this  I hope blizzard doesnt change kiriko because Im excited about her  junker queen seems woke motivated imo  but whatever.
I love junk queen. but I want ash.  original ow I liked sombra.
ow has had one horrible decision after the other  from horrible hero additions to stale metas to content drought  to woke nonsense  etc. but I believe  there is still an amazing game underneath all this shit. I only hope they stick to their guns with this one  and this can be the start of a new decision making  hopefully ow can finally become the game it was meant to be. cant wait to destroy your junkrat melonie!
I think kiriko is a monk of some sort    if you have watched some anime or read manga like inuyasha then you see what Imean.
what else should the japannese characters be  kamikaze pilots  sumo might work  quiet polite business men
Imiss the Bible verses at the end!
yep. meI thicc.
cultural appropriation  is a fancy term for gatekeeping culture  in germany we encourage other countries to adopt certain traditions as its a very prideful task for us. why cant people just be happy that their culture is appreciated and liked to the point where its added to a video game. people are so soft  just play the game.
as an american   I have 1 problem with cassidy. his hat s brim isn t long enough.I do have an issue with kiriko  that being thatshe looks like she was pulled straight outta f ckin fortnite. but maybe thats just me.
8 59 look at cyber punk edge runners  those are living proof that original inclusive characters can be made if you have the talent of writing
the only thing I can imagine a southern american complaining about with mccree and ashe is that they talk too pretty.
she s my new main
only monkeys can wall climb like that  hanzo genjI kiriko .winston is a scientific gentleman so he will never savagely climb over a wall so he is more human than the apes Imentioned above
she looks like a miko to me  not a ninja.  definitely a lot of inarI imagery
I dont see junker queen being  woke  she s just a post apocolyptic amazon type. Imean she literally uses  a crocodile dundee knife with voice lines referencing the character. bit too stereotyped to be woke.
miko aka a shrine maiden. her outfit is a modified version of their traditional garb. her other skins have some variants of it.
a japanese salaryman running around with a suit  briefcase and a slick pistol like a staplegun that fires stasis projectiles would be hilarious.
well ashe s background is a southern belle who comes from a rich family hence the robot butler who is her ult. she made the deadlock gang in her teens to spite her parents.
she is a miko  they establish that in the origin short. people on twitter are just too lazy to watch it. they see kunaI as the weapon   wall climb automatically  equals ninja in their minds even though her outfit is a modified version of traditional miko garb.
why do some people just hate traditions  I dont get it  the different traditions from all over the world make countries unique and cool
forget overwatch  look at the sheer destruction blizzard visited on wow  thank jeebus for private servers like wow-mania  which has the most blizzlike wotlk experience Ive come across yet. also the key difference between samuraI and ninjas was this  samuraI were honor bearers  where as ninjas were sin eaters that perpetrated dishonorable acts so that their masters didn t have to.
stereotypes are used because they work. and they work because people like them.those dipshits hate stereotypes not because they are bad  but because it is not them this is why they try to normalize all of those perversions and deviations  of both physical and mental variety . they want their  ideals  to be stereotypical and  most importantly  positively stereotypical. they want to be a hero of every show  every movie  every game.with new heroes coming up Imight even give overwatch another try. I hate how their net code favors fucking laggers  so it it is very hard to kill them and easy to get killed by them . but since I am healer main a kingdom for a mercy   it would be a good motivation.
why are all japonese characters ninjas someone tell that person hanzo is an archer  not to mention all 3 characters have drastically different roles in game.
cute waifu sells no brainer
hanzo s an archer. o.ogenjI is the ninja.kiriko is a shrine maiden.did they want kiriko to be a cowboy
kind of a big difference between samuraI and ninja  just saying
waitso who exactly is offended or is she making stuff up
kiriko is more of a miko instead of a ninja.. even her ultimate and skills are miko buddhism related technique except for the kunai.. her ultimate utilizes fox spirit  which originally derived from inarI  a fox deity in japan which symbolizes cunning and inteligence.. dear God  this woke people need to stop being so edgy the whole time.. not even the japanese people here felt offended whatsoever.. my colleagues here are loving kiriko so far..
how dare they make a character from a certain country be based on that country s culture!
its always non asian or non japanese people that have these issues. I bet japanese people would love these characters. especially because most japanese anime feature ninjas.
its hilarious  cause if blizzard made a samuraI who was anything other than japanese  they d scream cultural appropriation.
I thought they d be upset thatshe s voiced by a white woman. I think its cool an anime va voices her
I personally consider the lore they make for china to be the real one.
lol they can cry about it xd
still remember the time when they introduced wrecking ball  a fricking hamster in a big ball mech. so many people got offended that at the time they  still haven t added a black woman  but their next character is another male . its a fricking hamster! and the game is overall pretty diverse. stop crying.also they added sojorn now  so the crybabies should ve been calm at this point  but noooo  let s cry about kiriko being a samurai.like blizzard misrepresented my country with zarya  we are a traditional country  our men are big and strong and our women are very feminine and freaking gorgeous... Im not really feminine and Im pretty mid  but mostly its how I described it . do I cry about it  no! I even freaking play her as Im an offtank  just a tank now  main. just have fun  its just a Goddamn game  its not a big social statement!I am a bitsad they didn t give her a russian  or at least ukrainian  voice actress doe as her russian phrases sound fake asf  but its not me being offended  its my ears bleeding when I hear zarya speak russian
I honestly couldn t be bothered with anything blizzard puts out. everything is so sanitary and boring now. still loved the video mel.
I remember when sigma came out twitter shit a brick because it was a white character lol
see look more like an japanese shrine maiden  miko  than an ninja  shinobI  what is genjI role and the samuraI is hanzo
but isn t overwatch very woke  lol the irony
actually you are incorrect. there are historical records showing many samuraI were also part of ninja clans. shinobI were just a specialized troop which were scouts and spies. many samuraI also acted as shinobI at different times and vice versa. they didn t consider ninja dishonorable because their honor system mostly came from serving the daimyo  when they swore loyalty to him they were bound to follow orders and to disobey or fail in an order they d often choose sepukku.
the japanese actor who voices genjI actually plays him in overwatch and streams it if that gives you any indication. most of the overwatch league players are japaense or korean too.
you are correct if people bothered to watch her origin would of scene her going to the shrine with her grandmother. they literally talk about the fox spirit.
screw woke culture. kiriko is a breath of fresh air  even I know that and I am not even playing the game  ow veteran here  but I watch the reviews and gameplay and reactions of the general public. trust me when I say the woke ppl ain t the majority.they get upset at anything non-black or non-gay mostly  and just want characters with little to no story that look cool or resemble women-empowerment. like brah kiriko is a badass.
its funny because people like this aren t even from these cultures or never even been to japan.
variety is  the spice of life. diversity is  not what I ordered.
all of this is nonsense. my favorite characters are still belmont clan from castlevania  mega man  mega man x  link  super mario and most of all samus aran. know why  I know near nothing about her beyond she s a woman of action and only a few words. she s bad ass  suit aside  its her not talking about her feelings and just taking care of the task at hand  which is gameplay
you say junkrat main  my worst enemy haha
I think youre missing the point of the criticism... its not about how they re just using stereotypes. what they are saying  is that blizard took one character idea and is rehashing it on all of the three characters they made for that nationality. its as though japan has nothing more to offer than ninjas. that ain t sjw. thats just lack of ideas.
the reason diversity works in overwatch is because its an original concept. there are no other versions to compare it to. take something like the rings of power and the little mermaid and there is plenty of material to compare it to and then it becomes forced diversity. the latter usually gets the most backlash from the communities  which apparently makes everyone racist even though far less of these people usually have a problem with the former  which is at least as diverse if not more.
junkrat!
the last straw for me was when they retroactively made soldier 76  an established character for at least three years who was clearly modeled after clint eastwood  at least in part   gay.  76 was my favorite character.  not claiming he was my best character  I was more of a support player   but his personality  lore and appearance wise.  haven t played or cared about overwatch since.  I suspect we re getting more of the same woke crap from the sequel.
these are people who live to be offended
omg the entire aesthetic surrounding her home is a town based off a village in naruto. a dojo in the middle of the map. reeeeeeee blizzard being bigots by making the new hero a ninja reeeeeee. I love and hate it at the same time lol
honestly  Im just annoyed that kiriko has an american accent when  to my knowledge  she lives in japan
this aged we ll all the same people are simping over her
all of the charavters are stereotyped just look at junkrat hes the most australian character ever
great now I have new youtuber crush that will slowly crush my heart
Im a junk rat guy myself. also  play support as moira. and yes  macree  will always be macree. Im not impressed with ow2. I dont like the 5 v 5  I dont like the moira rework  I dont like the sombra rework. only good rework was bation  for the p ssies  but I doubt it will make a big difference.
you should go on some other shows to talk about wokeism and feminism in gaming. tim pool  the quartering  amala ekpunobI at prageru  brett cooper  the comment section  at the daily wire  sydney watson  savana hernandez  or Christy mayer of simpcast are all good options.
she s like moira
wait  you dont remember them hyping up the diversity in their games for woke points  you might have somehow avoided it  but they have been doing thatsince the start.  I agree with you that the complaints are stupid though.
ofc they are
shinto priestess to be exact
@jubeI yagami  shrine maiden or miko actually. her outfit is a modified version of a traditional garb they would wear. look at kikyo in inuyasha  her outfit is almost identical.
junker queen literally has crocodile dundee lines about her knife.
Ive already been on chrissie mayer  as well as simpcast multiple times
only thing in common with moira is her teleport cleanses her just as moira s fade does if you have a debuff on you.
blizzard deserves what it gets  never pander to the woke crowd nothing is enough.
blizzard get what they deserve  thats the audience they decided to simp for  let them have it.
cute ninja fox girl is a win.
at this point let s be honest people dunking on blizzard aren t doing it for a fair reason but mostly because they are still bitter at what blizzard has done in the past.Imean do not get me wrong  I can understand the anger of these people and I can see why they are dunking on blizzard  blizzard has earn the mistrust and hate from the fans for a reason.but we need to be fair here  kirito is not a offensive character and her being in the game wont hurt the game that much  people need to learn where to draw the line and not go over board with the hate other wise the company they used to love would never get better.there should always be support for the good things  not the bad. a lot of people need to step down from the game and do some self reflection because it is wrong to hate something that isn t deserving of it.
never played the game...not a clue what your saying lol but yes she look cute
hanzo - archergenjI - cyborg ninjakiriko - shrine maiden fox
samuraI and ninjas arent even close to the same thing. one is a fighter  the other is basically a rogue.this toon is based off a shrine maiden.
hanzo is a ghost. haha
what  overwatch 2 doesnt have a redhead in all her freckled glory  with an alternative skim that makes her black with space buns  so weird...
10 25 exactly
mmm I cant speak for everybody but me personally feel like it wasn t a creative design choice as far as making her another ninja especially with the fact that it looks like she s a shrine maiden or something. but Im not complaining about it though she s adorable .
a lot of the times stereotypes are a good way to represent a culture  if done right of course. look at lucio  my man got the perfect amount of futebol  samba  happyness and struggle in it  I dont know one brazilian that looks at him and gets ofended  including me  I am brazilian   all of us love that happy boy  but here it come the white middle class american get ofended for us or for the japonese people  thank you for defending us from the representation of the good parts of our culture  what would we do without you white man!
here we go here we go these people again
if there s one thing I never found bad where the character designs. most of the characters are really well designed.  I feels like tracer is great example of a fun lovable cheerful up beating brit character who happens to be lesbian done right.  im serioulsy liking kiriko s design. while I dont like overwatch 2. I can certainly appreciate the good amount of characters coming from this.  still annoyed by their so called   soldier 76 is gay  tweet. thats not how you do a gay character especially when he wasn t even one in the begining. also  not to mention  kirikos design is giving me sakura from street fighter vibes
remember when blizzard changed tracers  design  because too many wokesters were finding her to be too attractive for kids...
for me  I dont care thatshe s a stereotype. I care thatshe s repetitive. blizzard could have taken from any legendary  mythological  or historical context  but instead just made another ninja. even if they went with a katana wielding samuraI to offset genjI s swordstyle  that would have been fine. but  instead  she s another ninja with a shrine maiden motif. like you said. for america  they have two cowboys and a cyborg burger dad. australia  3 mad max characters. germany  two walking tanks...are you seeing the problem here  america has more going for it in different styles  but by adding in a joke. its formulaic  and this addition with kiriko is more formulaic than the rest. she s  yet another  anime stereotype coming from japan. she s a naruto character.she may play well  but...who cares  she s another plain faced  made cute but totally badass   ninja  character. as someone who didn t play the game for cuteness  and is actually getting very sick of how  evwything must be adowable in gaming  trend thats happening right now  its like the burning you get when eating something hypersweet.now  I dont play overwatch anymore. it got boring to me  as more of a narrative minded gamer. but  I can see why some people would be annoyed at the inclusion of yet another formula caricature. then again  anyone who still buys blizzard products is activly funding sexual abuse  workplace abuse  and union busting  so  really  there are bigger issues than another  sugoI  girl in media.
overwatch overwatch 2 has the most diverse cast of characters its how you do diversity right
it is a pretty game to watch.  but not my type of game to play.  the art style uses neoteny to make cuteness.
fun fact. warner bros had plans to remove speedy gonzales but mexicans protested itsaying they loved the character. stereotypes are not inherently bad. it can just be character identity. the problem is when the stereotype has racist undertones. this is not a problem in overwatch at all.
3 07 one ninja. two ninja. three ninja. its not ninjas. as someone who identifies as a ninja  Im offended by the person who wrote that tweet!
honestly im still pissed at all the crap they have done  specially in gameI really hope this game flop blizzard die  and sell their ipsand a decent company pick up overwatch ow team and make overwatch great again
she is a miko  her outfit is a modified version of their traditional garb. in her origin short they go over the fox shrine which her grandmother took care of.
they changed her victory pose her design was the same I remember that  controversy
they changed her pose  not design. in that case I do think the new pose fit her personality more  but either way the offended people were being stupid lol
she s not a ninja  she s a shrine maiden also known as a miko. her origin short even shows her going to the shrine to meet the spirit then being taught by her grandmother. your complaining about something that is not even true man.
few things1. mccree is now cole cassidy. bit of a downgrade  honestly.2. with things currently going on in the world  Im surprised people aren t calling for the removal revision of zarya
man...nerd  geek  gaming culture  whatever genre you fit into  all of it! its no longer fun anymore. since this intersectional feminist and marxist ideology infiltrated it  many people are looking for something to complain about or be offended by. I feel for you overwatch players  specifically the ones who have been there since day one.
she look like ninja  shrine maiden
she s not really a ninja imo more a chosen embodiment of kitsune. a mythical Goddess. what s wrong with this or ninja anyway
what  australia isn t exactly like a mad max movie  my day has been ruined.
overwatch always pandered to the woke I have to disagree  they removed a pose for tracer when the woke cried that it was   over-sexualized  that the pose had her backside showing  then again the woke cried when they released a skin for meI which made her a bit more skinnier in a chinese dress and blizzard complied... blizzard is woke personified and they pander to the woke while suckling to the chinese for money and having bad management
Im more offended that role queue is still a thing tbh...
melonie thoughts on cyberpunk edge runners its really good anime on netflix
let s not pretend that cultures and diversity does not exist.  it is what makes the world beautiful and fun to live in.  the problem with trying to please everyone is that you end up pleasing no one.  I want more ninjas to be honest lol.  enough to form a team of 5!
ninja  more like crinja
I enjoy the emily and tracer dynamic  but I feel like making soldier gay just didn t make sense for his character. he was clearly never written to be gay so it just seems awkward in its current state.
I just think its funny blizard apears to think all japanese people can climb walls and all black people are hyper mobile
I was born in texas and I dont have a problem with mcree I love playing him and ash but people are sensitive nothing is wrong with the people or the game
technically  hollywood s western portion of the map is supposed to be film decorations  not an actual western village. its hollywood.
two things one blizzard best not get bend down and give into these sensitive a s peopletwo I want to download twitch just to sh t on people so they can complain more and I can get a good laugh
listen  I like the overwatch cast and all  but they didn t organically create diversity for them  they did it deliberately.it didn t feel forced  but we should acknowledge the choices they made with certain of the characters.was it bad  no  Im not saying that.
hanzo   samuraigenjI   shinobikiriko   shinto priestess
she s a fun spirited asian that learned asl why are people upset. I choose my mains by how cute they are so stop crying lol
I dont really have a problem with her design in general  I personally hate ninjas!
just to point it out  they linked there twitch on the buttom.there only doing that to get views
if you dont want role queue just go to open queue. role queue was one of the healthiest things ever done for the game. it was terrible not having enough people in correct roles and you d get steam rolled if the other team played a comp that works.
@brad miles  hard disagree for quick play. competitive sure  but ppl would just all queue to play faster and then you d get tanks that weren t tanking or supports that would just play moira for kills and not actually heal.also you couldn t get any achievement progress in open queue for the last game. idk for ow2 since it barely works rn
@soundwavespectre  in ow1 open queue had its own sr separate from role queue comp. competitive at the lower ranks is rough for people knowing what they are doing. bronze thru mid plat is a crap shoot but once you hit diamond people tend to know what they are doing and queue for what they can play well.
@brad miles  again I said quick play homie.
@soundwavespectre  Imisread. you mentioned both are different points.
haven t seen it yet  but gonna watch soon!
it was an organic choice imo. they wanted a global cast of characters set in an entire grand scale universe  so a diverse cast fits with that. they weren t diverse for no reason other than woke points like forced diversity does
kiriko   shrine maiden aka miko  her outfit is a slightly altered version of their traditional garb. also in her origin short they go over the shrine and how she got her powers.
saying they are all ninjas in and of itself is very reductive and toxic. genjI is the only one who looks like a ninja. hanzo is more of a samuraI  and an archer which isn t stereotypical at all. kirko is a shrine maiden not a ninja. they are literally showing their own ignorance while trying to virtue signal. and virtually all japanese people dont want these clowns being offended on their behalf in the first place. they should have learned that after ghost of tsushima and all of twitters shit takes on anime.
overwatch has been my favorite game since inception. the lore is really interesting and I love how you can get in and get out when I dont have a lot of time for gaming. saying that they have destroyed the game by making part 2 by making it 5v5 and basing the gameplay off pros and streamer suggestions. dps que times were bad enough but now all off tanks will switch to dps bx no one will want to solo tank. I could go in for hours but bottom line overwatch is done and so am I and all my friends who play it.
junker queen...  when I saw it I thought it was mad maggie from apex...
if they dont make her a ninja what would be the alternative. a female sumo body positivity right . woman have to be accepted with all their flaws. while when have to pass a high requirement and ridiculed for something they have zero control over    ..2022 equality. japanese lore is great all my tattoos are japanese lore related. samuraI ninja dragons unImasks koI fish geisha even their ancient architecture. is all amazing  all the way down to their level of honor the world hasn t seen since
exactly because blizzard kept currying the woke trend  they attract thatsame pool of people who nitpicks about random stuff
I would say the people making those comments are racist  because she fits more as a shrine maiden trained in combat then a ninja. her outfit and powers  hell even her personality is like that of a benevolent priest with a young flair. do these people just assume that any japanese character who uses kunaI and martial arts is a ninja  thats super racist.
Im asian  I dont feel offended but I do feel that its too stereotypical. Imean brothers are good but they cant all be ninjas  there s samuraI  ronin  shinobu. you could choose so much more but exactly why are all they ninjas  I get that ninjas are very very popular but there is already two  you could atleast be diverse about it. and if you pull out the card that  if your not this that  you cannot speak on the matter  then there s no reason at all for you to say that at all. I personally think they should be more diverse with their asian characters if there s more than 2. I feel like the only reason she s defending it is because of her design tho
I like how woke people think everyone on this world own them somenthing
I honestly dont think sexual orientation or who is hooking up with who  should be in a game where a vast majority of their players is under the legal age of consent. its a game and should always be about the game and story  also the only problem I have with kiriko is how all of her abilities seem to be taken from other characters and how she is locked behind the battle pass  and immortality  but other than thatshe looks fun to play.
wait if soldier is gay does that mean that reaper is pharah s dad  ..looooore!!!!!
they aren t fans. they are haters. they are filled with hate for everything that isn t  woke
Im more into the gameplay and the character background is more of an afterthought. but I dont want characters that are created to make sense to the white person s pov. also gender race swapping in ow cant even exist. it is a medium that is presently being created with no  source material  to pull it back. honestly if kiriko was a japanese-born white hispanic black girl I d be cool with that too.
we have a cybernetic ninja who was betrayed by his brother maimed and augmented met a metal monk and learned self love bitch japan has make an entire genre around this so adding a shrine maiden guardian with mythical fox powers is completely in line with japanese tradition and media of badass characters hell kiriko isn t even a unique character concept japan has a line up of badass shrine maidens in their media
what s the problem   ninjas are awesome.  would they prefer a businesswoman in a slim suitsmashing people with a briefcase   a host of an incredibly cheesy gameshow carrying around an absurdly-sized inflatable hammer   how about a sumo wrestler with a diaper and a manbun   honestly the people complaining are showing their own racism when they assume that all ninja are the same.  clearly she s a very different kind than genjI or hanzo.
wait hold up wait a minute what about when they made snake eyes was into a asian
I think youre misconstruing that tweet as someone being mad about  woke . I think what they mean by that tweet was more that its pretty uncreative of blizz to release a new japanese character and make it just another ninja. feels a bit redundant.and even if you want to argue  but they wanted to expand genjI and hanzo s lore  that doesnt mean she has to be a ninja.like this is literally the first time Ive heard of this character  and I could already tell you how it could be improved and still fit what they want to do with her.ex  instead of another ninja  make her a priestess  like a japanese shrine maiden. she clearly has some of that already with how her outfit has elements of the type of outfit a shrine maiden would wear. and she also uses paper seals which are used by shrine maidens. and I dont think that would be too hard to tie into genjI hanzo s lore. shrine maidens are also a pretty popular archetype stereotype that people enjoy.this just feels like they started to make a shrine maiden but then some higher up said  thats not  cool  enough  give her some kunaI and make her a ninja . or they just lack creativity and dont know what else to do for a japanese character other than just ninjas.the character isn t bad by any means. she is cute. it just feels kind of lazy to make another japanese character just another ninja. similar to how ashe is pretty much just fem mccree.
the biggest stereotype is arguably zarya. during the cold war  the soviets let their female olympic participants use steroids. from there  the us propaganda in media depicted all russian females as hairy manly short-haired dudes. zarya is legit a russian female false stereotype from the 90s.funny thing is  russian slavic women are the most attractive in the whole world.
overwatch is full of steriotypes lol!! like  the korean is a pro gamer  the brazilian is a musician who loves soccer the russian is a  fking weightlifter  the german is a crusader ... the only problem I see is they repeat a lot some nationalities and and just forgot some others   but its coming some more new characters
overwatch is lacking finnish representation in the form of an always drunk character who rarely speaks.
blizzard how come your only korean character is a gamer
she s not even a ninja  she s a miko aka shrine maiden  they establish that in her origin short.
@brad miles  yeah  like I said  a ninja.
@namelessminion veinreaver  not unless youre calling a shinto priestess a ninja
that a pretty fair way of looking at it
yeah thats how I was looking at it. I felt the decision wasn t creative on their part but Im not complaining thatshe s another ninja. ima still play her
except she s not a ninja  she s a shrine maiden also known as a miko. its established in her origin short. people on twitter are just to lazy to watch it. to them wall climb or kunaI   must be a ninja. they actually used traditional japanese culture for the character and people complain.
overwatch has made their characters stereotypical representations of the countries they are from.  your examples of the american and aussie characters are spot on  so people need to chill on that.  a lot of people love that their country is represented in a global video game.  also  kiriko on a personal level is a lot deeper than that  as are most people.but to your other point about having gay characters or autistic characters  I do think representation matters.  people all over need to have those sorts of characters they relate to.  I have watched so many videos on reactions to things like miles morales being selected the next spiderman  and even the most recent event of the little mermaid being black where it has made people cry.  we forget that a huge portion of main stream superheroes and characters that we love are predominately white.so I do not inherently think having representation is too far  woke   but I do agree it needs to be part of the character s personality.  if it is revealed in a way that is forced  I believe that is too  woke  imo.
I know you will never read this comment  but me being gay it means a lot to me knowing a character is gay. in mainstream media all you see is white couples and straight couples. you say you like characters based on cuteness which is cool. but to be apart of such a small minority and seeing someone you can relate to in a game or movie makes you feel really good! I hope you change you views on that one part and understand what I am saying! overwatch is very good at diversifying their cast and with diversity comes with some sterotypes. and you can replace the word gay with any other small minority  age  race  sexuality.
love your hair
pandering to the woke crowdoh we sure do love buzzwords.nobody is offended over kiriko. asking questions isn t a problem.  imagine turning a question into a whole video.
yeah overwatch characters are full of backstory
blizzard trying to please the woke only to be bitched at by the woke. why do you do these things  blizzard. they scream the loudest  but they aren t the majority.
would they rather the asian female characters be bad drivers  ninjas are cool.
they absoultely pandered to the woke crowd what are you talking about  they shrunk a bait and retroactively made someone gay just for inclusion
they are all stereotype types but thats what makes them universally identifiable.  she is a ninja cause naruto is popular with the kids.  this is a business not your political agenda.
people are cazy they say you cant make characters unless you are that race gender sexuality absolutely stupidity
woke overwatch fans  sounds so rare. first you have to find someone that likes overwatch 2 enough to be a fan of it and then that person needs to be woke on top.
yes  the woke fans are right. they should design normal people to fight people with literal superpowers. would be wayy more realistic that way tbh.
waitso its wrong that they make a japanese character inspired by a popular aspect of japanese culture  but we need more diversity at the same time  uh ok how tf does this make any damn sense
I hate the word woke. I d probably be described as so  but gaming wise... no like if people want to see awful stereotypes play smite. they wont say a thing because smite isn t as popular as overwatch. there s a literal version of a currently worshipped God being a dj. my main issue is accents in smite because the celtic pantheon in general makes my ears bleed. but such is life as an irish person like....
new overwatch girl is cute
americans seem to be the majority when it comes to being offended about other people s cultures.
overwatch  releases playable hamster character in a hamster ball that doubles as a wrecking ballow fans  where s our gay junker queen!me  umm... what other game has a hamster from the moon as a playable character  that uses a hamster ball has his weapon  none. how is this not diverse enough for you  also sigma is the first white male character to be release after ana  sombra  moira  doom  bap  orisa  brig  ash  and hamond and they still complained about him being white and male. complaining about stupid things like this is what people do
what s most offensive is buying a battle pass just to unlock characters
Im asian  I dont feel offended but I do feel that its too stereotypical. Imean brothers are good but they cant all be ninjas  there s samuraI  ronin  shinobu. you could choose so much more but exactly why are all they ninjas  I get that ninjas are very very popular but there is already two  you could atleast be diverse about it. and if you pull out the card that  if your not this that  you cannot speak on the matter  then there s no reason at all for you to say that at all. I personally think they should be more diverse with their asian characters if there s more than 2. I feel like the only reason she s defending it is because of her design tho.
no shot there s woke gamers  thats clown  behavior
if you watch the video you will see I addressed this. none of that was the case during overwatch s alpha days
also I like the backstories. I didn t think tracer being gay was a reach to be fair and thought that backstory was nice. although its blizz so...
you dont have to buy the pass to unlock her  its free you just need to hit 50 on the pass to unlock her unless you buy the premium pass. if you dont unlock her in this bp then next pass you can get her thru completing a challenge. maybe look into the details before whining about something thats not even an issue
kiriko is another underwhelming character with a lack luster design.
words are extremely important. the word  Christian   mean s  Christ-like . nowhere  at any time  in anyway  did God  or Jesus state   accept sin  or  accept sinners   or   this sin is a-ok to get along with  because its not really that bad . what God said was  this sin or thatsin  is an abomination before me. what Jesus said  when his father separated    sent him down to show his love for his creation  by offering the forgiveness of sins   go  and sin no more . not-  hey  this or thats a-ok now  just be sure to give the  forgive me  shout out! . yeah  didn t happen. this absolute lie that a person who considers themselves to be  Christ-like   can just  accept people  things  actions sins  because   love   is leading people further   further from God. we are to forgive others  if they seriously   fully repent  from their hearts  and turn from those ways. then you can  accept them  back into the fold. Christians are no better than any other human being. because the names been corrupted. utterly  completely  intentionally. this was all planned out  long ago  in order to destroy the church- forever removing it   God  from our nation  forever. that is what they re doing. this has been programmed into tv shows  games  books  movies  commercials  everything  since the late 70s  early 80s.Im not posting this because I want  likes . I could give a crap about those. youlube hides them from me anyway. and many times  my posts. dont care- one day  they will  however. Im no Christian  although I used to be. Im not here preaching to jacks  t. I too  am a gamer. no better  and probably worse  than all of you. I had God once- then he left  something thats never supposed to happen. but did. no idea why. couldn t find out why  so maybe Im not supposed to know why. thats life. what I do  is give the truth- truth is undeniable  unchangeable  beyond fact. truth  just is. you cant change it. oh  many try  every damn day- they create new  truths ... except they re not- they re bulls  t. now  y all take wtf you wanna take from this. I told you  its just truth  it doesnt change  nor can it be changed. and it is not from me- Im giving you what God said  in every version. dont like  I dont care. take it up with God  not me. Im just relaying truth. period. people hate the truth. because  as I said  truth doesnt change. that  pisses people off  because it interferes with their fun  what they   believe . and truth   proves what they believe  is a lie. because it just is. hate the truth all you like. matters nothing to me. but for some  these words will hit home with a power never before known. and not one ounce of it  is because of me. all I did  was relate known truth  to whoever has the balls to read  but more important  attempt to comprehend  the words posted here. they are who God is seeking a relationship with. sadly  I apparently fall short. but none have to. not one- if you truly comprehend  truth. later. got a game waiting. only time I ll ever post this. delete it if you wish- its your page. insult all you wish  I ll not be back to response to idiocy- Ive no need. as I said  none of this is my stuff- its God s.Ive got my own problems  as listed above. I just wonder if God will ever help me to learn what happened that day  so many years ago. maybe not. his world  Im only stuck on it atm.
they he  is really the end of the argument  change my mind.
I have to laugh at how the person saying blizzard is racist by making them ninja are being more racist and culturally insensitive then they are accusing blizzard.kiriko is based on a miko or shrine maiden. it requires a lifetime of dedication from learning cleansing to mastering the kagura dance.hanzo is a samuraI which have a very different code of ethics and morals compared to a ninja.its the equivalent of calling a priest from rome a pizza chef just because they re italian. its amazingly ignorant
she s adorable and she kinda looks like you. lol
if people want to complain about  stereotyping  characters....if you want to choose characters from the us  then what else are you going to put for a fps games besides people with guns   that is cowboys and soldier types!  what else are you going to use for a fighting game for americans....some hillbilly   I guess you d have to pull out some stereotyping there.  japan has samaria and ninjas.  what else are you going to use to  represent  japan....someone running around shooting anime characters at people.  all games  to a point  if they have fanciful characters from regions of the world  then there is going to be some  stereotyping  because you are going to put what most people possibly know that region of the world for.  stop picking every little thing apart and crying about it.
mccree isn t gay  tracer and soldier are
woke people who dont even play the game are offended by kirikothere.. I fixed it
no one is complaining. this is bait for something that isn t happening.
I dont know the difference  then you dont have the credibility to talk about it
u forgot reaper isnt he muricantoo
I realize when you said autistic I think your talking about wattson from apex.and they pander so damn hard its crazy
why is she a ninja  because ninjas are cool!
fans
so do you think symetra fits the indian stereotype
isn t it the point of a game like this is to embrace stereotypes of all kinds  I dont even play overwatch and I cantell that much!
4 skin bundles in ow2 is the price of a aaa game at the moment.... four. wtf
I got overwatch characters on my sims 4 game
boom!
no hanzo and genjI are brothers they come from the same ninja clan so he is a ninja but man the new ninja kinda makes me want to play the game
we are told to love our neighbor whether they are Christian or not. I wish everyone would be saved  but thats not life. for me to only interact with other Christians is not biblical
@melonie mac go boom  I fully agree. and nowhere did I say that you should. what I did say was  we are not to accept the actions of others  when they go directly against the word of God. if you only interact with other Christians  how in the world are we supposed to change hearts   minds with our own actions  we are to lead by example  in the hopes that those who ve chosen to sin against God  may one day change their ways  and accept the word of God as the way  the truth    the life.one thing to understand here- I know these people  those doing what you see to our country today. I was one of them.  recruited    for lack of a better term   by them  to be one of those who would   work my way up  into a position of power . I was a singer  and had a type of  memory  gift as well- but I was a disaster. a  hippy  of that age. a runaway  a stoner  a drop-out.  for all intents and purposes  exactly the type of person they could mold to their advantage. they laid out in front of me  their plans to do exactly what we see today  in america. it terrified me- because I wasn t really a  hippy   although none would believe that- I was a country boy  fighting a bad home-life  and ...  in search of something . but I love our country-   this  they did not count on. Ive spent the past 40   years trying to warn about all we see today- none would listen. not even ask a question. what I know is vast. the help I could have provided  invaluable. none cared. nor care today  tbh- although they use what Ive sent them- see  they missed  all of this  because they refused to listen to what I was telling them- asking nothing in return. this has always stunned me. shocked the living hell outta me  actually. but still I try. they intentionally set out to force  Christians   to accept things they d never  ever have accepted  even 10 years ago. they have been wildly successful. they ve almost removed God from america. your own words are proof of such. there is no accepting things God has called an abomination before his eyes. that is not why we are here  to make them feel comfortable  to fit in. what God has told us to do  is to lead by such good example  as to put conviction upon their hearts  that they would change their ways  and save them from eternal damnation. that  conviction   would lead them to Jesus  and Jesus would take it from there. by making them feel accepted  to feel   normal   harms them. how canthey ever turn from what God said is evil in his sight  if we are capitulating to their sin  understand  that is the battle. and right now  they ve got people of God  being convicted in their hearts  to change their ways  take them down the path of evil  with them. of course they feel better. they are no longer on that path alone. this new evil  not only uses our founders   framers incredibly brilliant constitution in their favor  they use it against  us. these people who are telling you that you must accept their  lifestyle choice   care nothing about your salvation  only about forcing you  to accept what they do  as  normal . how can God love you  bless you  you who are calling yourself a  Christian   calling yourself  Christ-like   when youre accepting that  which God himself called an  abomination  to his eyes  this is not to say we must treat them any differently that anyone else. those are not what my words are saying. governments can grant the very same  to each   every person- regardless. that is their choice. and we are to love each   every person. absolutely. but how is it  love   if you know a person is sinning directly against the word of God  their own actions damning them  if we  accept  what they re doing as normal  knowing already what God has said about it  if you truly love someone  wouldn t you want to save them from such a fate  even though that is not our job  but God s  because we can save no one  but we can love them  by not accepting what they re doing  but by leading by example  and sharing with them what God actually says  the Bible then tells us  if they refuse to listen  we are to shake the dust off our feet  and leave these people to their sin  least they begin to drag us down with them. which is a gradual  and unseen evil  in and of itself. because  if these people truly loved us  as well  wouldn t they understand our belief  and accept our decisions and path we choose to follow  many of them abhor these words  because they cause  conviction  in their souls. its why they hate actual Christians.  Christ-like  human beings  who love  yet lead by example  and the word of God. but this is an incredibly hard thing to do. especially in this day and age  because they will destroy you if you say words such as these. and Im not even a Christian  as I said before. although I used to be. I dont know why God placed me in that position  so many decades ago. why I learned all I did  if it wasn t to warn america of what was coming- and it has cost me everything. Im not here to tell you to be a  better  anything. Im just giving you truth  what you do with it  is entirely up to you. these people destroying america today- put us in this horrific positions of impossible choices  intentionally. they ve been programming people for decades. and the effect is insane. I could show you all these things  but they d be better in the hands of people already in power  and with protection. but they refuse to listen. their egos and narcissism is great indeed. and they re too busy getting rich of what I sent them now- acting as if they  knew all along   what was going on.if this were true  why didn t they even try to stop any of it  I told them about it  showed them in advance what was coming. yet  they stopped nothing. the missed  all of this- thats why we are  where we are. that is how we got to where we are today. all of this  is connected. there is so much  I fully understand its hard to take in- and Im not asking you to accept this  only to consider it. I studied the word of God for many years. I both understand   comprehend what was taught. I cannot deny truth  because truth cannot be denied. its unchangeable. it just is. so I can speak about his word  even though Im no Christian. God left. I cant tell you why. they say thats  impossible . but remember  truth  cannot be denied. I only know I was once saved  the change was intense  undeniable  unbelievable. I had a thirst for the word of God  unlike anything Ive ever experienced in my lifetime. then one day  as I was rebuilding my world  one more time  it was ripped asunder once again. and that great void that was once utterly and completely filled in the center of me  was again  ripped open  and empty. Ive no idea what Imay have done  or how. like truth  it just was. and everything was taken from me. Ive rebuilt many times since. sought answers that dont exist  because churches and pastors claim they dont exist  because what I say is   impossible . except its not. so  Im no saint. just another lost sinner  who knows the word of God  fully. who fights against an evil I knew was coming  and have been damn near killed  for trying to spread. with the advent of the internet  I began trying even harder  to show people  by making  predictions  on the next actions of these filth killing our country- except they re not predictions  of course. 40  years of studying  learning  watching them- plus my past knowledge. this is why I have a 98.8  accuracy rate  telling people what they ll do next. they ve manipulated the church into accepting their evil- because people are terrified of being destroyed by them- but its not just that- its years of programming  easily provable  and once seen  can never be unseen. Ive said these things a million times  to many others. youre one of the few who ve ever responded  and in the same manner. I understand how you feel. to comprehend what Im telling you  puts you in a position where you must make a choice- something none of us enjoy doing  when its a massive one  one that will make changes in our lives  we dont really wish to make. but youre a good kid. youre open to most things. that can be dangerous  like someone saying   be open-minded! . that was their first manipulation tool. sure  have an open mind  but have a guarded  open mind. you will never hear them say that  why  you know why. common sense will carry you through. that too  is truth. take from my words  what you need. toss anything you feel untrue. but always test  before you toss. remember  I ask for nothing. I never have. Im not here to convince  cajole  force  or gain a single thing. you decide your life. no one else. then you lead by the very best example possible. but never  ever  accept someone else s sin  as normality  if youre truly love God. you walk with him. they must accept you- you walk in the light. they do not. the word of God is truth- it never changes- you should know this. and therefore  it  above all else  you know in both your heart  and your soul  you cantrust  absolutely. sorry this is so long. I hope youre able to make it through. I wont be doing this again  have no worries. thats not who I am. I gave you the truth. the rest is up to you. but I have no issue with responding  should you ask. what I offer to all  where I post. take care.
nope  symmetra was made autistic in the comic
@melonie mac go boom  o shit did even know thank you how you linkin kiriko
100  ninjas are fuckin bad ass
she s a miko aka shrine madien not a ninja. her powers to cleanse come from that. her ult is her invoking the fox spirit of the shrine.
@brad miles   kiriko is a ninja healer who is aided by her kitsune spirit. she canthrow protection suzu to her allies  or kunaI against her enemies.  taken from her wikI page
@ninjawolf1372  well her outfit and own origin short indicate she is based on a miko not a ninja.
@ninjawolf1372  guess you didn t bother to scroll past the top of the wikI  also from her wikI  kiriko was raised by her grandmother and mother in kanezaka. 9  her grandmother taught her about taking care of the fox shrine  traditions and the importance of community. 11  a highly spiritual woman  her grandmother s spiritual beliefs strongly influenced kiriko  and shaped her fighting style. 1  her grandmother taught her the ways of healing  and how to summon the fox spirit. 2  kiriko and the fox spirit bonded. 12    her grandmother is clearly a miko which is where most of the kirko s skills come from. it is from her mother she learned the kunaI and wall climb.
@brad miles  however she does look after a shine. she maybe part ninja part shine maiden
did they pick you yet
mey is bay all day every day
this is your sign and your opportunity to grow out of this childish shit  and begin adulthood.
I dont have a problem with it
press x to doubt
you lost me at junkrat main
what do these weirdos want   overwatch should double down and add a geisha.
why is the only german character a knight thats kinda stereotypical and offensive waaah waaah waaaah
all the americans have guns in overwatch  Im not bitching.
ninja s are badass...I dont see the issue
dunno why these people are upset she s so far down the battle pass most of them will never see her much less play her.
people likes to be offended just to be offended. bin so for years. than theres the failoures and contraversies blizzard has made over the years which seems theyve never learned from which also fuels the popularity of the hate towards blizzard as a whole. but you know what they say. bad pr is always good pr.
they dont care  buy nor play any of these games
woke people dont play overwatch. they complain on twitter all day while drinking starbucks in their safe spaces
ehh since blizzard has constantly pandered to these weirdos they will continue to pander to them so say goodbye to this design...  also rip blizzard.
although the worst part about kiriko is she just looks like a white e girl dressed up in japanese type garb. instead of looking actually asian.
lol.  the woke turtles dismissed everything else.  obviously  they never played overwatch.
these are fake fans   fake gamers
attention seekers  thats all they are and why they complain.
maybe these people want a black japanese xd bruh imagine hahahahaha
she can unlock her next season thru a challenge  you get her for free if you owned ow1  and its not hard to get to rank 50 on the battlepass. with all the launch issues just playing a couple hours last night I got to rank 12 thru fulfilling challenges.
@brad miles  thats good to hear  hope you are enjoying the game. Im gonna pass on this one since they apparently want my phone number tied to an account  and Im not giving my phone number to a company like blizz.
@vohr techs  yeah I had sms protection on my account for years now so not really worried about it personally at this point.
I think making soldier gay is okay  same thing with tracer but  making everyone like that is the opposite of diversity.
sad that there s no more Bible verse in your videos. well  it is what it is.
youtubers  this sucks  dont buy it!!!! only plays ow for viewscommenters  this sucks I wont buy it has never played ow before anyway.me  meImei!!! yes time to make human popsicles!commenters  she cant freeze with her gun anymore noob!me  d ng zh ! b x  z u!
I blame naruto... everything japanese   this is a ninja... she throws card things and has a spirit fox.... those are ninja things cause naruto!!!
how is that 3 ninja  only genjI a ninja for me  hanzo do look like a samuraI to me  and kiriko look like a miko something like a shrine maiden  to me  just because she use kunaI dont make she ninja  and no  hand sign is not only for ninja  just because naruto use hand sign didn t mean only ninja use it  hand sign is based on mudra  this is use from religious practice to dance and even some martial art as well.
yeah  like why is every scottish or irish character ginger.  moira in ow and horizon in apex
completely agree. this awesome cast of characters came about completely organically. these woke idiots complain about problems that dont even exist. its so annoying.
lmfao  idc  only to bring it up... you dont wanna get labeled  a bigot by a group of people who hate themselves   their race  and hate you
Im so Goddamn fucken sick of people getting offended by everything
we just wanna have good entertainment back  the question is when do we get rid of the woke cultists finally.
you ever gonna get back to reading scripture  or...
ha! twitter. people are too soft these days.
the only character thats gay is tracer
overwatch 2 is out next month  I stopped playing overwatch in 2020   have no interest in the sequel.
woke is the result of terrible parenting. parents should never spoil their kids. stop rewarding your kids for bad behavior. stop relying on the ipad to raise your kids and put them rugrats to work. now go clean the yard
and I am offended theres not more animal people! too many damn humans we need more hybrids!
should have picked mercy
I dont see any evidence that its the fans that are offended. also did you seriously make a video of this as if it was news after one example of someone being offended
all 3 of the new ow2 characters are female and junkerqueen is probably a lesbian considering how she looks.twitter still  reeeeeeeeeeeeee
yikes found a pick me girl while trying to look up the kiriko bow song yuck
for my more Christian centered topics  absolutely
I cant play mercy to save my life. the only supports I like really are moira and zenyatta haha
@melonie mac go boom  lol - no shade -I was referencing the song
its never enough for them
its time to stop listening to the woke.
remember here your talking to kids. im not saying adults are not playing the game what im saying is most people playing are pretty much kids  and will argue with you for anything you say.
three new characters are women. the are individual and strong and what  nope.
I as an american am totaly offended by the cowboys in this game...how dare!
mcree and soldier76 are gay Jesus blizzard. the pandering is real.
.
she s a pretty awful hero
this is the reason why I will not be pandering to wokies as a webcomic artist. I ll add a diverse amount of characters because no one character is the same realistically. but identity politics have no place in a post apocalypse action horror story. Im more focused on writing about survival. grotesque supernatural  entities do not care   weather ur a demI boy   a lesbian or a  strong independent woman. so making that the main vocal point in a horror story  is just foolishness. Im sick of seeing all of this content written on america that dosen t provide actual good source material in writing other than bolstering advocacy. and Imost especially hate when people tell  u u should be doing it.
seriously.. white westerners need to stop being offended for another race.. I am black myself... and I am pretty sure the japanese feel the same.. we can be offended for ourselves just fine..
I dont know why everyone is so woke mad about overwatch  anyway it is just a video game and woke people are just overreacting bout the video game which I think it is a great video game to play which I have never played at all and so I cant really say too much about it bout it and so I just wanted to say that if woke people have a problem with this video game that I think that they need to find something else to do and mind their dang business and leave this great video game alone  ok melonie. anyway I just wanted to say and make a comment about this topic of this video and I just wanted to tell you that to have a wonderful and great blessed evening at home and have a good night too melonie. also have a great blessed weekend too melonie.
the stupidity of the comment is based on the fact that not every japanese character is a ninja! hanzo is basically a kyoduka  a master archer. this commenter is the one stereotypically racist trying to be woke and inclusive! oops!
Im so offended  white socks and sandals are a typical german stereotyp!
nobody cares about overwatch their harmful stereotypes.  besides  no one plays anyone besides reyna anyway. thats valorant. ...makes my point about no one caring about overwatch  doesnt it   valoreyna is what s played these days after blizzard fucked itself with all the trans pandering  blizz cheung pooch-screwing  and china kowtowing.
do you know jeremy from the quartering   you do the same click baity nothing burger stories that he does. its like youre his female twin.
I just wish irish and scottish people werent always ginger.  its a tiny percentage of the population.
who cares that their ninjas  just looks like a fun game  Imean who the fuck cares really   except for the asylum dodgers. says it all really.
oh wait  arent you the terf woman that was sexist against tomb raider  why are you still here  I stand with humanity  get out.
who fuckin cares lol
a lot of the male player base love the waifus tho haha
what a compliment  thank you
