I want lizzo to be the next batman. if they re gunna go woke  I want it to be unintentionally funny.
we want a movie version of the animated justice league show.
the day wouldn t be complete without a daily melonie mac video.
imagine an entertainment company that gave fans what the fans want. instead of what the company  thinks the message should be. well done video again.
mel mel I really think when it comes to telling a story  they need to remember who got them were they are. theres a lot of big corpos investing in these smaller things so they get to say how to lead the  herd  of people.
100  agreed with you  give fans what they want  its that easy
this is not hard1  bring everybody back from zack snyder s justice league  including martian manhunter 2  have darkseid kill everyone off3  reboot with flashpoint  keep what you want  who you want 4  build back up to the rematch right    above all else  take your freaking time!
batman has always been in my top 2 fav heroes. and I actually enjoyed black adam. sorry for taking so long in responding. I just got back to my house a little while ago. I love the outfit  a very cute tomboyish look. but lets face it you could make a potato sack into a cute outfit. I really hope youre doing well. I figure its to let to post this where you ll see this  but Im writing anyways. love ya mel  keep being the amazing woman you are.
spot on as usual.  there s this decades long library of stories that have appealed to so many fans  and such diverse fans  but instead they continue to aim for a smaller and smaller target audience that has no interest in what they re offering.  and  at the same time  they insult fans by thinking that they ll spend money on product because they are fans and therefore brain damaged.  who needs this behavior from people who want our money and  when they dont get it  demand that it be given to them otherwise the fans are  insert negative classification here !  hopefully zaslov can kick out the actual morons and get people who want to appeal to their audience.  james gunn looks like he may be a good start.
watching batman begins  in imax. that was the defining superhero cinema moment for me. I d never took batman seriously and always thought of the character as a silly joke but when I saw that film I became hooked on the character that bale and nolan created and felt a strong connection to it.  a direct to streaming service just wouldn t compare to that event.
alright new video. always good to see you melonie. I wont get to watch for about 4 more hours  take care melonie
this revitalization of dc can start with an incredible superman film.
I see nothing difficult about undoing past bad decisions.  you just ignore what has come before and just go in whatever new direction you want.  make the future stories well-written  respectful of traditional comic book canon  and consistent.  there doesnt have to be a flashpoint to change directions.
yes batman is the best. I was called batman in real life  for protecting people and cybersecurity  aspect. but putting movies back to the big screen  it would make people go out more and be more social. I think somethings need to stay original  and or go back to the original formula  so that way everything can go back to how it was.
biggest problem with the snyderverse was studio execs taking control of the editing room.
hey melonie what s your opinion on the whole should superman or batman keep their trunks or update their suits
you should definitely do the verse of the day again!!! that was soooooo awesome to see especially in the gamer community!
ive stepped into a movie theater like.. twice since they all opened up. I absolutely loved going but the amount of people who ignore theater etiquette such as using their phone which is distracting  the loud chatter among themselves  walking in late causing more noise and annoyance. or those sneaking into a theater and still doing all above. its annoying. I honestly dont mind till a movie hits a streaming platform so I can be comfortable and enjoy it myself
just appease the fans that are actually fans
new video!! hope youre having a great day melonie! youre looking wonderful today
that would be funny
Im all for this  dc should go out with a crash.
only if the main antagonist is condiment man.
@a shot of whiskey  I dont know if that could make it past the ratings board as a r rated movie lol
I just looked up the name on google
they should literally credit the villain as  straight white male . screw it  let s go full woke and not even give white people names anymore.
@a shot of whiskey  he d probably be lizzo s sidekick in real life.
dont give them ideas! bat-lizzo
all it takes is 1 fan to say a woke idea. just 1.dc executives   fans  we listened to all of you. we heard your cries. due to high demand  you get lizzo as batman!
that would be way too long
yes exactly admittedly I think rebooting everything is a bit too much of a cop out at this point
thank you
truth
Imean  youre not wrong.
facts!! we love mel s content on here and her takes on the gaming and entertainment industry!
@frank marte jr  Im here for all that and her stance for God.
accurate
@otterloopb  same
melonie macaroni
I would protest
lollol
@a shot of whiskey  main antagonist is responsibility
oh no  its batman!  lizzo hungry!!! nomnomnom!!!
@dark highwayman  please dc do this.
zaslav has stated there is no reboot.the trinity is back just as he wanted anf will be the focus for 10 years.
lol no snyderverse is dead. bury it.
so justice league apokalips war
@blacklives orblackvotes  instead of just moving forward  its still gonna be confusing no matter how good the new movies are. make one last snyderverse killing everybody. hard r! marvel didn t have the balls to do that. then move forward however you want   the future films would be in a better spot for it.
@blacklives orblackvotes  snyderverse is not dead  its just in comatose because snyder have contract with netflix. snyder still promised darkseid war and infinite crisis
didn t zavlav said they want copy marvel  which means its gonna be another mediocre product like previous regime did. I said this again and again  they should continue to end snyderverse. thats where it got profits  none of dceu movie got profits post aquaman.snyder only need to direct 2 jl movie and he will end it  before he come back. they need to do batman vs deathstroke  cyborg and green lantern corps.
I was 12 and got to see it in imax  I loved nolan s trilogy  warts and all  most of them are in the dark knight rises if Im honest . I liked matt reeves batman  but it was a little uneven  had some dumb shit in it  batman just killed a bunch of people on the highway and we re never gonna bring it up  thatseems like a valid reason for people to not like him when he s crashing trucks on the highway  or  why does riddler have an incel army  though an incel being the villain was a lot better handled in the batman than in most films nolan s trilogy  particularly the first two films  are superhero films at their zenith. at this point  I dont want dc to do a universe  you know what I want  a 50 million dollar thriller starring the question. I just want well written characters and a well told stories. unfortunately  or fortunately depending on your perspective  zaslav wants to push all the major players  which is fine  but there are so many under the radar characters that would be cool if done right.
you obviously never watch batman the animated shows. that version is what fans called the perfect culmination of who bruce wayne and batman is.its has everything that you want from comic. although the animation looks kinda childish but it have adult stuff in it. because of this animation success  they did same with superman the animated shows. then they continued this with justice league animated shows. this 3 shows is what fans called the perfect dc animated shows
@bobo boy  I did watch it. I thought it was ok for a cartoon. but it wasn t my batman. nolans batman is my favourite batman. ok
@john smith  riddler isn t really an incel nothing about his character says he hates women or lacks sex. sure he is the stereotypical to some extent lonely insane man who obsesses over society but literally so was joker from 2019 to an extent. and that fits riddler s character he is an ego maniac who believes everyone is below him and either owes him something or should be praising him.
@bobo boy  the animation is the best childish is not how I describe that.
Im driving home from thanksgiving holiday thats why it will be several hours
thank you so much
problem is every director want to copy Christopher reeve movie and not comic.
what I want as a fan is heroes actually being heroes. in marvel my favorite hero is spiderman because he helps people in need rather than others that tend to be more focused on saving the world or bigger  those storylines can be fun from time to time  but that kind of thing is almost all we get now when I want to see people being saved on a smaller scale.
it will be hard to find a new batman voice for a new animated series. kevin conroy was irreplaceable. it will be hard to find another voice actor that is as great as kevin was
for as long as the eyes were on the money and on the audience many decisions can be split in two
we ve seen dc cancel a number of things recently. seems like mostly woke garbage  too. I really liked black adam  tbh. not a great movie  but it was fun. hopefully we ll see more of a focus on fun.
yay! another dc fan. some of my favorite comics. still waiting for the  real  swamp thing movie. run by   alan moore   stephen bissette.
adding to the ezra miller   amber heard situation you had the old warner brothers executives that was basically sabotaging their product with the woke ideologies.I agree let s superheroes be superheroes again and not just superhero movies movies in general we want to be entertained not be bombarded with woke politics and messages.   hopefully zaslav can course correct and give the fans what they want. I wouldn t say a connected universe is a copying of marvel if they re truly adapting from comic books thats how comic books are  these superheroes are supposed to interact with each other.
I just want a batman as amazing as the nolan films and just as much fun as some of the animated series  episodes  such as  harley s holiday.  the animation in that episode... ugh  so good!
I just want a steel movie starring terry crews
black adam is better than anything on phase four
I just wanna see john stewart  wally west  plastic man  nightwing  and kyle rayner on screen
hImelonie I hope your belatedthanksgiving with your family wasterrific as u all wanted.
I really think they need to have people who are competent in world building and maybe focus more on the trinity over the jlaI would much rather have more focus on superman than hoping the next batman or ww would bring the crowds
avod stands for advertising-based video on demand... I looked it up thought it might help others  so they might not have to look it up for context...lol... thank you for the content! your outtake on black adam is exactly what I felt about black adam lmfao  the story was awful!!!! and I guess our expectations to be entertained are so low now that even though it was a bad story I still felt like the movie was good for a while then I watched jurassic park   and though it was not that black adam was a good movie it is just that movies are so bad now that a mediocre movie is good today... movies I feel have regressed in the past 10 years and I think honestly movies 20 yrs ago are just better...kinda sad really...
hey  melonie. I posted this somewhere else but I thought I d share it again here   also  I would ve posted this in your latest video but I didn t see the option.  youre not alone in this fight  melonie. God  and many others  are with you.
I think black adam is an awesome movie.
the one thing thats always plagued dc films is the fact that the corporate head honchos have way too much control over the damn franchise  this is very evident with the problems ben affleck had with them that led to  creative conflicts  - and why he ultimately gave up on his batman film because of them.
what we need is the dcau in theaters... with theater quality!
thank you for calling out the hundreds of streaming services!I gave up cable satellite several years ago for netflix... but then also disney ... but then also hbo max... but then also funimation... but then also amazon prime video paramount ...we re not back up above  100 a month yet  not yet............
I am a big moon knight fan  anyways  thanks as always for your insight.
ezra fell out
spiderman despite his power  he still considered as city level heroes. while on dc side  only batman is city level heroes. others is world level heroes and universe  superman  green lantern
@bobo boy  yet batman has done nearly everything the other jl members have done.
zaslav is cancelling the shit.he wants the central trinity and flash with aquaman.
I thought  the batman  was quite good
@scott aaker  its good but its barebone good. its failed to portray why batman is fans favourite heroes
hes too old a younger actor would be better honestly
there s wont be steel movie. the issues came from team up movie. perfect introduction for steel is superman vs metallo. superman cant fight metallo because of kryptonite so this is where steel is needed
my kiddo playing t ball was more entertaining
I dont know black adam was kinda trash to me that action was a bit fire tho but at the end with the cgI shit ruined it even more
I enjoyed black adam. I want to edit it myself where I cut out the beginning  the useless cringe child and the ending.basically  cut 30 minutes from it and it d be pretty solid.
idk about that
like it was so enjoyable compared to the others also I watched black panther wakanda forever and that was also very entertaining
black adam was a flop.
thats not saying anything. y all cant be that desperate.
the rock is a brand not an actor lol.
please ! melonie is sucker for dc. black adam is not better than shang-chI  and the legend of the ten rings.
not saying much. I heard that movie was mediocre.
@homomagii  lulz! of course.
black adam was highly  mid . it was nothing good at all and it was quite a ways from no way home. but I do appreciate they didn t do the woke.
@bouta tak3 an l  black adam was mediocre and forgettable
@philI the gamer  absolutely  but I d take black adam over love and thunder any day. just today  I decided to give it a rewatch and immediately contemplated how I possibly had the willpower to push through and watch that movie the first time in theaters. words cannot describe how bad it was. at the same time though  black adam is nowhere near as popular as shazam. it was stupid for dc to listen to the rock just because he was an a- lister
@martin diaz   good one
thank you so much  that means a lot  my last video got demonetized so thats why is must not have worked there
@melonie mac go boom  sorry to hear your last video got demonetized. thats awful.
moon knight is a pathetic batman knock off.I accept no substitutes.
@dcmastermind first  opinions are awesome  thank you for yours
@dcmastermind first  moon knight is awesome though and I am mostly a batman fan the man is kind of insane kills criminals and wants them to see him he doesnt do stealth lol. also batman was based off of a few characters himself such as the shadow.
@dcmastermind first  not the movie dude. the dang comic.
@dcmastermind first  year zero its more like year one  year zero is the poor new 52 version of year one.
@dcmastermind first  yes because its his second year that means its year zero. do you know how many year two batman stories there are  arkham origins  year two. batman telltale  and if I am not wrong batman earth one was based on his second year as well. its clearly taking from year one as well because of the setting focus on falcone and the crime families and catwoman plot. as well as based on long halloween which similarly has a bigger focus on falcone and selina being his daughter potentially. as well as the drug trafficking if am not wrong. earth one comes into play with bruce s mother being an arkham instead of a kane. as well as the riddler plotline. yeah think of me as you want totally I am not a batman fan because your petty technicality of the year two setting lol.
@dcmastermind first  go chill out and get over yourself lol.
@chandler burse  matt reeves based the movie on year zero and long halloween which is obvious.the new 52 canon was excellent
@dcmastermind first  I dont care. but year one is clearly there too. literally I just looked up  is the batman based on year one  and the first result was a wikipedia page for year one with reeves stating it was indeed an inspiration for it. just stop. maybe year zero did base it. but clearly year one was involved too and earth one I know that for a fact as well because there is literal plotlines taken from that comic. and new 52 is okay. I hate how young everyone is yet they have the same history let characters age for once.
oh yea  my favorite part of the day....keep up the good work miss mac
not wanting to buy a company that is doing well makes sense from a business standpoint. let s say its not doing well and the shares are  10.00 each. I think I know how to fix that business so that the shares will be valued at  20-30 each. and with that large of a company  he s going to rake it in.
restorethesnyderverse
keep it up  mel !!
yep  a 12 film contract for henry cavill  renewable in 2028
Ive said this before and I ll say it again  dc just needs to make a superman vs the elite movie. but these producers probably see themselves as the elite rather than superman.
the other news I heard was they will be connected to video games unlike what marvel is doing.channel  mbgvideo  upcoming ps5 remake makes big change  God of war ragnarok wins goty award  forspoken   more  nov 28  2022 chapter  2 06 - james gunn confirms that future dc games will be connected to the new dceu.
they had zack snyder in the dceu making things happen with the writers and others I recommend they continue d that line up except for birds of prey and ww84. released the ayer cut and the future movies set after zs justice league. no reboot
I think initially dc wasn t copying marvels format with the jl movie then trying to do solo films after but it was just handled poorly. I think now starting over with the soft reboot of dceu is the right way to go this way it doesnt erase everything from before. personally  I feel mcu is played out and their last film didn t do well at the box office. I liked black adam much better personally. if marvel puts our crap critics still love it where they hate everything dc except batman. so their bias dont help  mcu does seem more woke so not surprised lollove your style with the baseball cap you look like a 21 jump street character from the 80s or early 90s melonie.in a good way
no. I firmly believe we as fans need to give up on corporations entirely. they do not respect these stories they are adapting and they do not have our best interests in mind. fans need to start making what we want instead of expecting these people to do it for us. they never will. they dont care.
canthey just give the fans what we want already   I think that answer is going to end up being  no.
upbeat  uplifting superman movie. american really needs some truth  justice  and the american way. the nolan movies were great but darn we really need some uplifting entertainment with all the crazy woke nihilism in the culture.
if you already have amber heard takes in aquaman iI then just add a johnny depp cameo to surprise everyone.
to be honest I reaiiy iiked snyder s mos and bvs  I wouid have ioved a sequeI of superman which mantained atmosphere and feeI of those two  not sure it wiiI ever happen though since they want to reboot it  I know some may say its not reaI superman  its a bit different  its too dark  but phiiosophicaiiy I reaiiy iike that take  it expiored things and themes that are not super common in superman s mythos iike what it means to be a God whiie growing as a human  and what it means to be an aiI powerfuI pureiy good iawfuI chracter in this day and age  which is absoiuteiy fascinating to me
phase 4 did have some hits   misses !
it would be very  very clever for dc to rebuild now and giving the fans what they want. because now the window is open to take over from disney  gaining the market shares that disney will now lose from month to month. in the end dc will be better and stronger if they now play their cards right.
keeping customers on hbo max is simple  just add all the old looney tunes cartoons and the batman animated series.
make snyder-verse happen.
its so annoying that hollywood is physically incapable to make a movie about a villain
a couple days ago I found out this gorgeous woman is in her 30 s. bro Im amazed.
thank you so much!
I follow snyderverse since early 2016. the truth is deeper than that. it goes as far as man of steel pre-production. nolan laid everything for snyder to do. nolan s superman is actually realistic takes on superhero among human. wb actually dislike nolan decision because they want blockbuster director. I still remember there s old article said nolan interview 11 director but 8 of them want to copy Christopher reeve version again while 2 refuse that offer. snyder is the last person and snyder s vision is similar to what nolan want.snyder said in supernova  sidney  wb execs want clark kent grew up in chicago which snyder against so he told nolan and nolan purchased land to grew crops. that land is kent s farm that we saw in man of steel  bvs and zsjlafter nolan no longer involved with dc  snyder were left alone to fight wb execs. snyder said in one of the interview. he propose superman sequel  at the end of movie. kryptonite arrived in wayne manor and suddenly all wb execs want batman in sequel. they even bring out old batman vs superman script from 2003 for snyder to direct. snyder said he cant do anything. so what he did is combining his ideas from superman sequel into batman v superman script.jay oliva who did man of steel screenplay also said snyder actually want to direct 5 superman movie but wb are the one enforcing him to includes other heroes just to fight avengers  this happened after haters said snyder ruined dceu with bvs. did yourealize from man of steel to zsjl  there s superman in each movies  only 2 movies were left thatsnyder want to direct.
@boboboy8189 there was also supposed to be a nic cage superman actually years ago but didn t work out. nolan s vision similar to snyder is too dark for superman  I can see how that didn t work out  honestly. snyder we all know has a certain  darker visual style. nolan s style is more grounded which I think is one of the few issues with his batman  the movies are solid overall but compared to the other batmans kind of weak tbh. way back between cage s superman concept and returns  they wanted tom welling but he had to turn it down due to scheduling conflicts with smallville at the time  so thats why they got routh. henry ironically also auditioned for returns  so had welling not been busy with sv he would have donned the costume  which fans still want but if he does it ll have to be an older kingdom come kind of superman or future version from his universe.nolan is already a blockbuster director though so I  think there s more to it than that. snyder was the bigger name at the time but now nolan has made a name for himself as well. nolan had finished his trilogy there was going to be a 4th in the works but bale and nolan just felt it was time to finish it.nolan has issues with wb for his other reasons now however  so I doubt he ll ever come back unless the new wb regime work with him.yeah there was a lot snyder had planned that wb fought him on  jl was a mess due to him having to leave with whedon sadly we all know how that turned out. bvs the directors cut which is snyder s cut was better than the theatrical but wb forced him to put that one due to time.similar to snydercut  but the fans wanted it and got it and was much better than joshtice league cut. snyder had a 2 to 3 part jl plan of movies laid out but sadly didn t go anywhere due to old wb fighting him on it  he had more superman too planned.with the new wb though hopefully we can get something more besides their soft reboot planned  they can easily just keep cavill in future snyder movies if they wanted to just say  snyder verse  a different universe like pattinson s batman on earth 2 separated from the main dceu now since dc did do the multiversal concept before  mcu afterall.
problem is they owned those ip  so far the only success fanmade movie is street fighter assassin s fist. that because of capcom  japanese game studios allowed that.
they cant even give comic accurate the suicide squad and black adam.
plus general zod was portrayed so well in that movie very underrated
@amuraby hernandez  yes  one can see his point of view  his motifs  he s a soidier  breed  born and trained his whoie iife to be a soidier and to do anything in its power to defend and ensure the survivaI of its own pianet and peopie  at the same time one can see how it ciashes with kaI  which was raised on earth  as a civiiian  a simpie country boy  who vaiues freedom and justice and how kaI is forced into fight and be vioient and ruthiess by a ruthiess enemy  whom he s forced to kiiI and happens to be his iast tie to its own home  origin and the iast one of his kind beside himseif
david zavlav want to copy marvel formula. so I dont think he will go to that route. its sad because dc live action is known to be more mature than marvel but now its digressing into kiddie stuff. its all started with josstice league then followed by aquaman later by shazam and ww84. no wonder none of dceu movie since aquaman are profitable
if you believe giving fans what they want  black adam wont be flop.
we only subscribe to one streaming service at a time. no exceptions. it is a matter of principle!
in the 90s dc had an issue with popularity selling comics. I think they should have the same response now and give us the death of superman! I dont particularly like the dc lines but thatstory arc I loved and collected all the comics and still have them today. if you want to see if people care about your character threaten the deletion of them. with henry cavill playing the character they may stand a chance to salvage something.
just want some good red hood content. a boy a can dream.
as much as I wish dc would go the route that marvel did with wokeness  dc recently went full woke with the titans live-action tv series on hbo max unfortunately.
she looks so astonishing with her curly hair... I came here so see her video but I cant concentrate d
we just wanted the big blue boyscout. just give us two hours of cavill being the nice guy. steal some diniverse scripts if you have to!
dc has a lot of great characters. in the hands of a semi-competent writer  could be a cash cow for decades.
I actually liked black adam
I thought  the batman  was okay. my major problem with it was that zoe kravitz started going off about how  male gaze  and the skintight catsuit are evils of the world. I also though it was too long.  I never saw  black adam  bc I thought they were trying to hard to bait viewers into seeing it w  the cavill cameo. I also knew next to nothing about the character
take your time  plan a 5 year cycle. the problem started when they tried to catch up to marvel
while I d love it if we could get the return of the old dcau  batman tas  superman tas  justice league justice league unlimited  and maybe a flash and or green lantern cartoon to go along with it  I dont trust dc to do right by it and it just wouldn t be the same without kevin conroy. I would like a proper nightwing game though
peacemaker is fire thats all I ll say
they new to slowly it to the justice league work on building the characters up first and do end credits for some evil coming closer to earth like about darkseid that lead s to the characters having to come and join force to stop him
as long as the activists have even the smallest amount of influence the content will be the message
if you do the math  zack snyder s justice league would have made  3.3b in the box office  yet they want to abandon his movies.
I remember when people chose between netflix or hulu. then they realized they could see even more content  while still being way cheaper than cable  if they just got both. then we had went full circle to where people are actually paying more for all of these separate streaming services than they would be if they just got the standard cable package. now  people just subscribe to a single service while their favorite series on thatservice is ongoing  then unsubscribe to put that money into a different streaming service that is running their next favorite  or currently ongoing  series.I do not know the answer to this current problem  but if I was in a position of power to make such a decision  I have multiple avenues I would explore. the first of which would be a youtube like feature where everything is hosted on one streaming service  but none of it was made by thatstreaming service. you could pay for a subscription to thatspecific series  and only pay while you want access to thatseries. this would make the average viewer pay far less than cable  while connecting them to a much greater array of television  all under one login  while keeping them able to pick and choice what they want to pay for  thus allowing the consumer to decide what shows are seen as profitable to the hollywood execs  bringing it full circle to the good old days when the consumer s opinion actually mattered.
it is always best to buy a company when it is in a downward spiral  it costs less    .
restorethesnyderverseffs
hopefully  we will see a return to studios actually making content the fans want instead of forcing ideology on them. watching the recent flops coming out of disney  strange worlds and lightyear  and seeing the lower than expected returns from the new mcu wakanda movie and pretty much the rest of the mcu really shows you that they care more for using beloved franchises to trojan horse the activism ideology  than good story telling that the fan base appreciates and will pay for. doctor strange s cameo in the new scarlett witch movie really disappointed me in particular... it is a good example of the recent effort to sideline and make fun of male main characters in their own stories so that we can have the strong female character shoved in our face at every opportunity. it is much  much more evident in the new star trek properties  and dont even get me started on halo.
I think its a little to late for me. Im over hollywood  over sports  over it! I bought a harley  so I ll be on the road.
its already did in bvs.
they did and itsucked.
based based based!!!!!!
@melonie mac go boom  thanks
a red hood and the outlaws animated series or movie would be dope
@walrusjaas  exactly
@walrusjaas  I was thinking more like a red hood hbo hbo max live action show done right just like the netflix daredevil.
if you want red hood  dc need to rebooted. for example they need to start from scratch  not doing old superman or batman like they did now.my version of dceu is create 5 solo movies first for each heroes- first superman movie  introduce jimmy olsen and lois lane - villain is parasite - second superman movie introduce steel - villain is metallo- third superman movie introduce martian manhunter - villain is lobo or monghul - fourth superman movie introduce supergirl - villain is brainiac- fifth superman movie introduce super son  jonathan kent  - villain is mr myxztplyx - first batman movie  introduce alfred  robin  dick grayson . at the end of movie he became nightwing - second batman movie introduce batgirl- third batman movie  introduce robin  jason todd   at the end of movie he died- fourth batman movie  introduce red robin  tim drake   at the end of movie he retired- fifth batman movie  introduce robin  damian wayne
jason doesnt even exist yet lol. apparently bvs robin was dick and I dont know how to feel about them killing the literal prodigal son of batman off  without any scene either.
@bobo boy  please keep demon boy out of dceu. batman has enough sons in the comic as is. let s cull them a bit.
@bobo boy  also none of your superman movies had luthor as a villain  thats kind of odd.
@chandler burse  I heard. thats a shame
fkn a!   superman being superman  no evil superman  no  the public hates fears has a problem with him .  thats more a batman thing these days.  one good film is the foothold the character needs now cavill is back.
@markleafs  I disagree though. without consequence  superman is very boring character. what makes superman felt more superheroes is consequences. without consequences  you basically make children movies
@bobo boy  you can have a good guy superman with conseqeuences lol.
they all left hollywood. only incompetent activist or b movie writers left
Imiss the justice league cartoon so much. I feel terrible for kids today with the trash entertainment they get. we were so spoiled with good cartoons. now Im remembering how green lantern made me cry as a kid in the jsa episode. speaking of  if hollywood is so about diversity and inclusion  where s my john stewart green lantern
have you seen doom patrol   just as good.
piracy is always the answer. dont give greedy companies your money.
the problem with dc is they use their two top superheroes too often  batman and superman. they have a collection of other great characters with great abilities and stories about them but they prefer too much to depend on their two top tier heroes to rely on.
if jim lee is still running dc comics then its no surprise that the comics have gone woke. I am a big fan of his wildstorm comic when he was with image and his art style. but  he was pushing the envelope back then. gen13  created by j. scott campbell  had the first lesbian hero  rainmaker  I had seen. Im sure they existed before then but its where I had seen it first. so  Im not surprised at where dc has gone. the modern culture producers seem to corrupt whatever they touch. I hope it changes direction
fans want to see dc  injustice into a movie trilogy.
I have an idea. go back to broadcast tv for most series  in which viewers influence advertisers which influence executives and producers  of content and commercials . cable to show recent after they ve had theatrical runs  as well as vintage movies. and dvd bluray so one can purchase and own movies and series they like. surprise surprise  warner throws their catalog on a streaming service and no one buys anything. w hy should they  where s the marketing  go into a video store  ditto book store  and you see tons of available titles  some of which might interest a customer. boy have we gone down the wrong road
look  if there s a one percent chance..
not saying there isntnsome comics and g novels of batman  x-men I dont love  but Im long done. the best american comic is the og tmnt run imo. Ive been buying indie comics the last few years and manga. I d like to get into heavy metal and other mobius french books. raz rfist says italy has good books too.if you never read them  the 1984 through the 80s tmnt comics  worth your time.
to me the biggest problem with dc is that they decided at some point their character s core concepts were boring just bc marvel came along and changed superheroes a bit.  they started trying to make their heroes more like marvel  giving them flaws  making them morally gray at times  making them  relatable   more realistic and they ruined the hero worship power fantasy of it.
big screen makes the experience larger than it is.
youre very smart  beautiful n great woman keep up the amazing work melonie mac!
I have faith in gunn.nobody knows the comics and characters like him!
I dont think dwayne johnson would have gone for a woke movie or that they change the characters to much. I think he knows doing those things are bad for a movie. itseems like he had quite a bit to say  when it came to the movie.
there is too many streaming services right now.  Im not an advocate of corporate mergers but either someone needs to bow out or someone needs to step up and create a shit ton of new content
I think that what dc should do  and they re kinda already doing  is scrap the idea of having their own linear cinematic franchise like marvel s done in favor of creating stand-alone stories while using actors who best fit the roles across them. like viola as amanda waller. henry as superman. margot as harley. john as peacemaker. zach as captain marvel. dwayne as black adam. gal as wonder woman. jaI as captain boomerang. this would allow them to create whatever story the director wants without worrying about it having to tie into a  greater  picture. kinda like they ve done with the suicide squad and what they do with their animated films. thats what I think would allow dc to step out of the shadow of marvel and even take the lead in superhero films.
reeve s the batman was so because it was very unlike anything marvel has done. a batman detective movie  finally.and yes  the comics have been hijacked for some time my dear.
let tim burton make the next justice league  he never missed with batman.
@0 07  batman  amazing      p   frank castle is the best xd   honest question. what version of comic book characters do you like more and did the version you like most help you appreciate the other versions     I never liked the punisher  but then I saw  thomas janes  punisher movie and now the punisher is my fav comicbook character not related to a movie series  like aliens or star wars.
before the video even starts Im saying at least half of us want them to copy marvel  the built it up right and everything felt right going in infinity war and end game  but dc was like  no we cant copy marvel so let s throw out this trainwreck then go back to the solos and build em up
what they need to do is actually create a dc universe that ties episodic and movie content into one universe. what happens in these shows relate to each other an affect the universe as a whole. a couple of rules  1. use the original looks of the character  including skin tone. the heroes we know have yet to be represented from the pages onto the screen because they keep making unnecessary swaps and alterations. you can find actors that both look like the character and can act as that character. the  best actor for the job  has both qualities  so do it right  or dont bother.2. no multiversal bs  thats what made crisis on infinite earths necessary due to continuity issues and the like . multiversal stories are just cop-outs for the inability to write content that gels with the rest of the content around it. read some comics  collaborate with other writers for the films and shows  have loremasters that keep things straight  and you ll be set. 3. slow down the content. having a bajillion movies and shows all coming out at once is overload. people need time to digest and process what they ve seen  so give them that time. if what you make is actually good  it will last long enough for new content to get the time it needs to be good. 4. stop hiring activist hacks and people who aren t fans of the characters and dc universe in general. we ve tried that  and the content sucks. if they dont care about the character  they wont give them the care they need.
rebuild of dcegelion...
20 years ago hbo was on top with the sopranos and the wire. I remember it well.its a joke now  but an excellent library of films. thing is  I buy laserdisc  dvd  mostly blu-ray and 4k ultra blu-ray. I dont need thr streams.
disagree  unlike marvel. superman and batman is father of every superhero today. if youread superman and batman comic  you no longer need to read 90  of other superheroes.
I think jim lee is still dc chief
disagree  if you create mary sue superman. its gonna be 2 dimensional character. its already happened with theater s cut of superman 2. if youread comic  you will know superman just like human have emotion and he very weak with his emotion. that why batman knew how to manipulate them. while batman is reversed superman are refuse to follow his emotion and the result is he is very predictable
seriously  tell me which comic the suicide squad used as adaptation. the only thing he did is costume accurate but the lore and story is far from it
@bobo boy  it was based on no comic.starro the conqueror was justice leagues first villian but the movie was still awesome.you have zero argument
problem with black adam movie is the script and plot.black adam in lore supposed to search and kill shazam. instead we got amanda waller used superman to fight black adam. what the heck is that....another thing is villain in this movie is very poor  its like watching generic tv shows where villain came and dies.
problem is zavlav already said they gonna use marvel  template
he gonna do killing spree again. remember tim burton did batman killing while smiling
frank castle is a deranged man who has some serious issues awesome but honestly on par if not worse than batman s own mentally issues. thomas jane was good  but his movie was still out of touch with the actual comics. his voice is perfect for frank though.
you think producer know all of this  you obviously didn t know what happened last time when snyder want to create 5 superman movie but ended with justice league. they forced him to do justice league to fight marvel s avengers. even with that pressure  for me as snyderverse fans. snyder still nailed it.
I prefer the snyder cut of justice league personally.
I agree the last 4 dc films we got were better then all of phase 4 of the mcu or m she u lol
I ll tolerate a movie with woke elements if the storytelling is spot on  the artwork is amazing  and the characters are likable and dislikable in a likable sense. as compared to a movie with bad all of the above  but the woke elements are jut shoved in your face. even movies not woke that have terrible everything is a slap in the face.
the crazy part is this is prime time for dc with marvel loosing quality in movie
I dont want to buy a company that is doing well. that is actually standard business practice. you dont buy a house that is already fixed up. you buy a  fixer upper   then fix it up to sell it for more profit than it was worth when you bought it. the same is true for businesses. you dont buy a business at its peak. you buy it when you see its potential  but it is not living up to that potential  so you can buy it for cheaper than it is worth under right management  then give it the right management to turn far more profit than the company could have done under the management before you.
finally found aomeone who sits like me lol. people call it weird but meh. its comfy.
well melonie I got batman 1989 as a paperboy any thoughts
I agree with tarantino and scorsese about the state of the film industry and like them wishing for the day when comic book films are no longer trendy. if anything I would love see the film industry go back to putting out sane films instead of the endless rash of comic book films.overall its quite a shame something pioneered by tim burton is getting way out of hand.
I would never be a scent.at your service my queen.lol
things are so awful. its time to rewatch rocky.
its still amazing to me that  give the fans what they want  is such a dirty concept for movie makers. fans want to see superman save the day. people want to see him struggle against a non-super powered genius and fall in love with lois and her indomitable spirit. fans want to see batman fight crime and save people. people want to see him use his intellect and resources to solve crimes the police are struggling with. fans want to see wonder woman be a force of olden justice. a warrior with the blessings of the Gods. and  yes  I would like wonder woman to have the weaknesses she has from those blessings because  otherwise  she s way too powerful.we want to see these things done well on the big screen. we want to pay to see it. what s so wrong with that
gal gadot is the ben affleck of wonder women.
I would like to see dc try again with a justice league dark movie. gullimero del torro was supposed to p put one together but then dc canceled it and turned the remains into the disaster of a film that the first suicide squad movie was about. that is why there were street level characters fighting against a magical belly dancer played by a victoria secret model with no acting ability at all.
I had to come back because I forgot to like the video.
black adam didn t appeal to the old school fans because they changed the characters so much they were unrecognizable. hollywood will never respect the source material  so comic book fans wont turn out.
dc has the three best superheroes of all time.  if they cant totally blow marvel away  they re pathetic  especially when marvel has become so poor.  dc has potential  the first wonder woman film was great.  they just need to focus on solid writing and ditch amber heard and ezra miller.
recast the flash first
how do you mess it up   you ask  simple. instead of focusing on the majority of the fans they are doing exactly what the political arena is doing - putting vocal unaffiliated minority on a pedestal  dubbing them  fans  and playing to what that majority currently claims to want  which changes daily  mind you . no shock when a project is finally completed you ve alienated the original actual fanbase and only cater to the handful of loudmouths that no longer will appreciate whatever you do and try to undermine it on every corner. thats how you mess it up.
they re overthinking it. either continue the snyder story or do a soft reboot.just tell the fans what youre doing and layout a 5 movie plan and stick with it. its not that hard.they have the actors already and they just keep delaying.
who would have thought that a few years later marvel movies would be the symbol of cinema garbage while dc gave us genuinely good super hero movies
pioneered  I thought richard donner did superman 1 first  donner are the one that change hollywood about comic book movie. before that  none of comic book movie are successful. what tim burton did is create darker superhero adaptation on live screen but the one that make better than tim burton is alex proyas s the crow
Christopher reeves superman was technically the one who started superhero films but if anything I think raimI s spider-man is actually the first superhero film to make them trendy and realize the potential in them.
@chandler burse   and youre wrong. superhero films started with zorro in 1920 however Im not talking about that. in the case of tim burton he completely changed the game and nature of comic book films with batman 89 and its sequel by making them mainstream. dick tracy bending from this.
@bobo boy  zorro  1920  was the first ever comic book film.
@gloria thomas  I am pretty sure raimI spider-man has been credited with the establishment of popular superhero films and their continued production but whatever.
classic
@mala  its one of the few films that makes me feel optimistic.
@Im a friend of sarah connor  yeah  of course. when I am down  I always imagine rocky running up the steps and that triumphal music accompaning thatscene. such an hartfelt  raw  emotional and motivating movie.
life is in general awful lol.probably always was.
nope  guillermo del toro send jl dark script in 2012 but they never called him again. later in 2016  wb announced jl dark movie director is doug liman  edge of tomorrow . in 2017  its reported that doug liman has schedule conflict. after diane nelson took over wb  she s scrapped everything from snyderverse and geoff john plans
@bobo boy  well david saslav is the guy now in charge of wb. the guy that canceled the batgirl movie is in charge.
@bobo boy  I am not snyder fan. I hate him. he ruined dc.
@big guy617  zavlav is not our saviour either. trust me  every movie after this will be flop like black adam did. gunn never use source material in all of his comic book movie adaptations. he just make them wearing costume accurate but everything else including lore is not. I said this again  dc copying marvel is wasting time and money. dc should be its own thing. they already have template from btas  stas and jlas but sadly they abandonthis in the name of modern audiences. we all know the flash will be flop  china will save aquaman 2 again and ww3 will be another jenkins s lynda carter diana again.I still dont understand  the only way to rid snyder s fans is to end his movie with jl part 2 and 3. by why you insist to fight with them when you should let them to ended it
@bobo boy  at least gunn wants to talk to the fans and hear their ideas. marvel is calling the fans trolls.
dwayne s ego actually ruined black adam lore. seriously  why on earth black adam refuse to search for shazam  but instead they make superman works for amanda waller to fight black adam. what the heck is that
Im good with my nolan batman trilogy. they are my favourite comic book films and no other comes close to them. I cant stand anything from the mcu. I d like to see another cavill superman film too.
james gun has got this.
they just might give what the fans want once this woke phase is over. shouldn t last more than a couple more years before the woke cancel themselves. lol
marbles66 years old not counting the 2tynes the were going to be cancelled d.c.106 yearsand stan lee and nimshooter and bobkane and steve ditko all saud  when I looked into making a character.I often looked atsuper manbatmanwonder womanbatcavejustice league....for inspiration. marbles has a ways to go before they go toe to toe with the...kingun..quoteyeah  marbles has had some awrsome jeyears. granted. but  if any of you can watch wakanda forevermsmarblesdrstrange multiversecaptain marblesmshulksafe spacexmen red xmen greenthe hellfure gala !I d go on but  there is no room left
been hearing that james gunn has a plan for this  and will introduce it over the next few days. and apparently the games will be canon as well.can we just have more michael keaton as batman
give us definitive batman and superman. a proper take on the characters. not grounded. that only limits them to elseworlds stories like the batman or joker.
what the hell is that outro
a big part of the problem has been the snyder fans. they re the very vocal minority  that kept insisting that dc kept churning out these half baked projects. they cant be told the majority of these films are objectively awful. its fandom at its worst...
no more universes. I dont want any more universes. just give me a good film with superman in it.
hey warner brothers.  you own dc  which has superman  wonder woman and batman  plus other potentially appealing characters.  how about you give us movies  comics and tv shows that actually feature all these characters  instead of someone s idea of what a  modern  batman wonder woman superman should be
it feels good to know I am not the only person who is conservative and does not like these woke stuff going on in our society
zaslav   I dont want to buy a company thats really well run  because if its ruined they ll blame me.  if itsucks already  I can blame it on that.  mwuahahaha
dc s like a guy who doesnt know how to please a woman  but brings her home with no warning anyway so he can waste her time fumbling around.
melonie  canthey just give the fans what we want already warner  fans have no clue what they want.fan  are you serious  you believe that to be true warner  you cant handle the truth! the  truth  is you will watch what we make and you will like it. if you dont then we will stop making any dc crap for you. we will just release whatever cheap crappy movie we need to hold onto the rights. so have nothing and be happy.
when did we last have a thrilling story and iconic moments in a dc movie  was it  dark knight rises  ...   the next would probably be the first wonder woman movie  which was flawed  but it at least had iconic imagery with gadot in her costume. story is the biggest weakness in dc movies. tell a compelling story first.
if dc and marvel would stick with the original comic book stories in the movies and not add anything that is woke then the world would be great
the batman director thought he made a superman movie. the batman should have died at least 8 times in that film.
actually  I think dc is in a better place then marvel. even  with everything going on. if I was dc  I would test the waters with lesser known heroes and get to work on the cinematic universe. and try to pull it back to a more 90s version of heroes .they most likely know  batman  superman   supergirl and wonder woman are good bets in dc universe. so  space out those movies in between the lesser known heroes.something like  superman  then cyborg   then wonder woman   then zatanna   then batman   then john constantine   then super girl   follow up by lobo   before returning to superman again.
d-she universe
bring back the art to hollywood! stop pushing politics! comics always incorporated what was going in the world in their stories. marvel was one company very famous for this. back then though  they actually put heart into the stories. it was less about politics and more about the story. stan lee served in the army during wwii. thats where the inspiration for captain america came from. and fun fact  marvel wasn t even called marvel when cap made his comic book debut. the company was called timely comics.
yeah. do you like dark knight rises too
@mala  yes. I love that film.
@allennium falcon   ok.
but nolan failed at batman hand to hand combat
@bobo boy  no  the fight scenes were good and based on real fighting techniques instead of flashy acrobatics which wouldn t work in a real streetfight and consume far too much energy if youre going to be doing this stuff all night. Ive trained in muay thaI and mixed martial arts for over 25 years so I know what Im watching. plus many actual martial artists such as buster reeves developed those fight scenes and nolan listened to their advice.
@allennium falcon   admittedly bale s batman does appear to be a bit clunky with the suit when he fights. probably a special effects issue.
he s no kevin feige ! but good luck to mr.gunn @dc.
tell that to the suicide squad. only costume is accurate evening else is including the lore is pretty bad
as long as people want Christopher reeve version  you wont get a real adaptation of superman
all movies are elseworld stories let s be fair. the mcu is literally its own earth in the multiverse and its taken stories from ultimate marvel as well as 616. in fact its much closer to ultimate marvel if anything. the batman is based on long halloween and year one which arguably at one point were canon but at the same time are argued now to not be due to new 52 and such. its also based on earth one which is an elseworlds and I love it.
@bobo boy  reeves is basically the closest we ever got to the boyscout in the sky who cares and saves people and isn t always so edgy cmon lol.superman is usually as happy go lucky as reeves portrayed him admittedly yeah there is serious moments but reeves had them too.
Im one of those fans. they already have plan but they scrapped it. did you know the last time dceu movies were having profits is aquaman. after that  its flop and flop because they refuse to do what snyderverse fans want. another thing is snyderverse actually makes dc distinguished from marvel counterpart but sadly zavlav want to copy marvel...
its wont be good because everybody has different interpretation of what superman should be
dc didn t do live action  wb is
@bobo boy  Im aware of that. I was talking about the on-screen branding  not the studio.
problem is there s thing called runtime. do you know why sin city and 300 works  because its only graphic novel that focus on one story and it has real ending. while superhero movie is not  whatever ending in superhero comic is not a real ending. this raising a issues with film maker were though every movie have real ending if not thats bad writing.even japanese comic has problem with runtime  so they change it to fit the runtime. problem is when you change things inside the script  it will affecting the entire script. rurounI kenshin is considered the best live action manga but its still plagued with this issues. even james cameron alita battle angel which he adapt from 80 chapter of manga cramped into 2 hours movie suffers with this.
please supergirl shouldn t be dcu because any superhero that has same power set is bad writing
@bobo boy  Imean I guess batman and green arrow are culprits there. richness is the same power lol.
I only halfway agree with you. super girl her own character. and if hollywood cant see that. then youre totally right.but  if they can write her a good story with maybe a cameo from superman. it might be better then you think. but  this comes down to writers and not selling the characters short. and Ive seen that before.
the woke stuff is not the only problem. the problem in the first place was doing controversial story decisions that never payed off like superman killing zod and batman killing a bunch of nameless henchmen in bvs oh yeah doing batman vs superman as the second fucking movie was a big mistake and then they genius idea of killing off superman in that movie to jump start a justice league movie that ended doing so bad it needed a recut that never even existed. also there s the idiots thatseem to have a mindset of  giving the fans what they want  what do the so called  fans  want  there s no saving the dc film universe just let it die already  I swear to God. if zaslav  gunn  and safran want to pursue this lost cause then they got their paycheck. Im done with dc  no matter who s in charge they ll never from past mistakes and they ll keep repeating the same mistakes or create new ones. dc is dead  the dream is dead. Im moving on.
I prefer the dark knight series over the batman
Im worrying less about dc movies now since they got james gunn as head. I think they re in good hands
was black adam good
the batman was the best comic book movie all year.

gooooooooooo melanie!
damn this girl is too pretty.
love you  3
we still hadn t got s proper superman batman movie
avod - advanced video on demand
to bad dc cant use the injustice storyline
dc has a golden opportunity to steal super hero fans from marvels broken universe. after endgame everything else has been literally endgame lmao for marvel
they definitely shouldn t copy marvel now with how they are currently lol
please reach out if something is going on with you. you seem like your suffering from body image  and I just want you to know if something is really going on please reach out to someone. you and anna seem like your dealing with something  and I notice it.
I actually prefer dc movies. just because they are not afraid to try new things  and make more versatile and grounded movies like joker or new batman movie. not really  fan of all that copy   paste marvel movies.
the cw has ruined a lot of good dc characters. zaslav needs to be set loosealso  jl dark apocalypse war was better than the mcu s infinity war and endgame.
they aren t thatserious about rebuilding. they still blackwashed hawkman. if whitewashing is unacceptable  then so is blackwashing
I wish I wasn t orthadox and know tattoos are a sin she s cute
I really dont care if amber heard plays mera but for the sake of the work environment she might need to be recast.as for ezra miller  Im sure they could have found a much better slender white guy. I dont understand why marvel and dc keeps serving this doodoo.by the way  recast black panther t challa like yesterday.
depend on what you said is good.if you want non woke superhero movie. yes if you want a great writing and story. no
according to snyder haters. the truth is we already got it in animation
thats what justice league part 2 were planned to be. but we all know self proclaimed superman fans hate it because its not superman
zavlav already announced they gonna copy marvel. no wonder they hates snyder because snyder is the only director that brave enough saying dc should be its own thing.
tattoo is sin. for me its looks like someone has skin disease
batman is cool but superman is my favourite dc character. henry cavill  man of steel iI 2023 or I riot.
yeah maybe they need to stop having website news headline saying  shazam 2 is making history being the first superhero movie that doesnt have a supervillain from the comics!  super stupid and nonsensical.
dc better not go the way of the dodo.marvel being a dumpster fire right now is a ripe opportunity.
dc def isn t copying marvel lol
I hate how much miller has sullied the image of the flash
its really not that hard  they just dont want to do it.
dc should have copied marvel. not in tone but in the making of a cinematic universe. iron man came out in 2008 and you could see what marvel was up to at the end of that movie. man of steel came out in 2013  so they had 5 years to plan.
the tv model is dead. none of them are gonna end up being cost effective. too expensive...they will all fail in the end.
marvel was more the woke franchise. so it makes sense disney did well with them and not espn. dc is the brawn hero not tiny gay man hero theme.  d batman was the only brain hero of the universe and he was strongly red pilled or at least libertarian.
ive said it before and I will say it again  there is no need to give a movie a political agenda. good movies are good movies without trying to be woke and in todays world the movies that do try and force an agenda dont get watched and plummet in the ratings so its proven not to be the way to go  go back to source material and stop re-writing source material to cater to the woke movement
you say cable
comment for tomb raider
removing amber heard is not enough.  I will only watch aquaman 2 if they give her role to depp.
I think losing 3 billion   got there attention ... hopefully
you got the expression wrong its nerd s wanna see beautiful people in tights beating the h    out of bad guys nerds called that poetry
the only reason marvel us still so popular is because of hype.every movie in phase 4 has been overhyped trash.itstill sells though.
what the hell does  woke  mean
yea they need to get rid of the woke bull before they become successful again.
comics are now propaganda  not stories.
truth is Im not going stop watching a good movie franchise just because one actor went rogue  thats a bit childish.also the so called woke side of dc and marvel thats not what bothered me the most  what bothers me is how saturated the superhero genre has become  its so repetitive and overdone  kind of a really burned steak that you order and you have to send it back to the kitchen as its inedible. this is my plea to wb and disney take a break from the superhero genre  all you are doing is playing a broken record over and over again.
Im old
@melonie mac go boom  Im older tho.
the batman movie sucked! black adam was pretty decent  I cant wait until constantine 2 comes out. hopefully they do a batfleck constantine cross over. really they need a stand alone batman movie with ben affleck.
hey prettiest melonie  so yes dc should make their own way because  the new marvel sucks too much woke arguments and less creativity.
the crap will always come from mcu and their fangirls they cant make masterpiece art cinema like joker  batman and zack snyder s justice league
stop getting british guys to play american superheroes
black adam was better than that boring the batman
maybe its a good idea to copy marvel
I am sorry mel  marvel   dc  and dc always seemed to lag behind marvel on all accounts.  not just the movies.dc just sucks.dont get me wrong  I like batman and superman  but all in all  the marvel characters  have a more memorable roster of characters.
1st
I disliked this  I kinda loved black adam.
the batman is weak...
what do you mean stop copying marvel   thats such a moronic statement I just came to type this message and leave.  didnt even watch the vid.  if they were  copying marvel  they would of came out with all the single movies first and not just throw justice league in everyones face without knowing much about the characters..  if you want to go with copying.  dc comics came out before marvel....  dc came out in 1934 while marvel came out in 1939...
dc is dying  nobody cares about their characters. its all about batman and thats it. dc fans keeps telling people that dc is better than marvel but when you see the amount of money they make in their movies. itsays otherwise. dc is dying slowly  even adding new management aint gonna fix it. they will be known to be  copycats  because of the marvel success. whatever they do good they will always be compared to marvel. dc will shine but in the shadow of marvel. if I were warner bros. I would just burn dc and move on. nobody cares about their characters at all. nobody is hyped for their movies.
dc will be better because james gun is here so we have hope
advertising based video on demand. basically... hbo advertisers pay for space while viewers pay for content
dc  marvel  disney  all dead properties.  time to go back to keystone comics and 3 cent gum.
