I cant tell you how important it is to see a fellow believer engaged in this theater of the culture war  video games  media  etc.  as Christians we re supposed to be salt and light in every corner of our society  but its always felt lacking in this area. with games and the like being a major avenue of escapism  especially for young men  its vitally important there s folks that can share the truth and hope of God s word to them  so you got a very unique and important ministry sister! ps. have fun in the lands between  I need to upgrade before really enjoying elden ring  lol.
elden ring is the best game Ive ever played in my life  Im completely addicted to it lol and honestly what I love is that the difficulty is not an arbitrary option in the menu detached to the experience  but you can find difficulty within systems and content in different builds  summons and so on. the integration of the difficulty in the design is what makes this game unique and absolutely a masterpiece. wish it played at more than 60fps tho lol
fully agree with you on the trend of boring  monotonous  cinematic  aaa games.
Im so glad you are encouraging us to draw near to God!  those Bible verses are lovely.also Im even more excited to play elden ring after you pointed out that it has the og tomb raider games  sense of solitude and isolation.  yes  please!
Im 80 hours in and its getting so damn hard but still probably my favorite game Ive ever played.
from software doesnt need to cater to the mainstream. they already have a loyal following with  dark souls  and  bloodborne . they know what their audience wants. a challenging yet beautiful open world with places to explore that will challenge them.
this is my favorite game in many  many years. I love the respect the devs show us by not treating us like children who need handholding.ea  this is the sense of pride and accomplishment you spoke of.
in a way it kind of sucks getting older watching everything we love be belittled down for the participation trophy generation. I dont know if you ever played super ghouls and ghosts back on thatsnes back in the day but the people nowadays would lose their damn minds trying to play that game
3 22 thats one of my biggest peeves about most modern western game development. a lot of western games feel way too automated and take away control from the player. I understand there s a lot of good in making the game feel less clumsy  but when its something like a platformer  these things take away depth from the gameplay and in turn make it less fun.
as a fellow tr fan  I personally enjoy that you eventually circle back to it with a lot of points you are making about the gaming industry. love me some  real  og badass lara. I definitely miss the isolation  exploration  and sense of wonder. ironically  I think crystal dynamics actually does some of the tombs really well. I wish we had more of that and the set pieces were of a more grand scale and for goodness sake  bring back some color and globe trotting. I could go on  but I ll stop here... conversely  Im glad elden ring stuck to their guns and its paying dividends for them. love your commentary and how you always include scripture at the end of your videos.
I can relate to a lot of what you said in the Bible commentary. before 2016  I had been more involved with my church  helping a men s group I was with in doing annual fund raisers  like an ice cream booth at the fair  and the fall sprinkler blowout - things that help the community and give back to the church. unfortunately  my then new job got in the way  and I found it hard to balance between the two. at first  I wanted to be thatsuper Christian that can do it all  but I came to realize I cant. so  for now  I focus on work  and I wait to see what happens as the covid restrictions are lifted. not to mention  shifting to mornings might be the change job-wise needed to start getting back into a few things. but  for now  just making it to sunday worship would be a great start. anyways  thank you for the verses  and am enjoying your take on modern gaming.
I just found your channel this week through simpcast  which I found through either friday night tights or slightly offensive  but you have quickly become my favorite because youre Christian  and you seem strong and passionate in whatever you do. you feel very relatable to me  being a single 34 year old Christian into games and anime and blah blah blah and finding myself surrounded in these fandoms by people who hate my Christianity. Im happy to have found someone else striving to be light in that darkness too   thatsaid  I really appreciate your mindset about challenge and fun in games  how the best games have those two work in sweet harmony  and especially that you mark the cutoff for that golden era of those kind of games at ps2. I think basically once autosave and checkpoints came into play  it was all downhill as far as developers babying the playerpersonally I rarely play anything past dreamcast these days  other than new retro games or remakes of old games on switch lol but I like watching others play modern games for some reasonalso Im very happy that you ve been enjoying your time in the Bible this year. if you started in genesis  surely you ll be in leviticus or numbers by this month lol hang in there!! you may know this  but statistically those are where most people will drop out of their Bible reading plan.in my experience  it helps to make extra effort to look for Jesus in those books. for example  leviticus shows how much it means that Christ fulfilled the whole law for us  and also how far we all are from ever approaching God s perfection. especially considering how many of God s dietary and sanitary laws to the hebrews were very  very far ahead of their time  showing that God s wisdom is way ahead of man s despite all his efforts. and numbers is very much an outline for the rest of the story of israel  which ultimately represents each Christian s walk with God  ups and downs  moments of victory and moments of defeat by our own undoing  and the grace of God present through it all  guiding them through the wilderness as the spirit also guides us today.God bless you  and thank you for your content. looking forward to seeing more of you!
your speech at the end was very poignant for me. itstepped on my toes in the way that they needed to be stepped on. I have been lacking in my quiet time with God  and I guess he used you to remind me of what  and who  Ive been denying. thank you so much.
I love your take on the tomb raider thing. I always thought there was something wrong with the newer ones  but I forgot just how much the older games expected you to just figure things out. I love the channel  keep it up!
great line...  I could just watch a movie if I wanted to! 1000  games of 2000 might not have had graphics but gameplay and story blows anything today out of the water
heya  extremely glad to find a youtuber with rational views that values the merits and mechanics of games over the social political views  and tops off every video with a Bible discussion! youre a diamond in the rough and I cant wait to see more of your content
I remember playing tomb raider iiI when I was a little kid  I barely made it and I only finished it because of hours and hours playing it  it wasn t easy by any stretch of the imagination  but I was having a lot of fun playing it  and once I finished it  it was such an achievement  I will probably never forget it  and same goes for dark souls 1  even though I was an adult when I played it. I cant wait to play elden ring.
I feel like miyazakI is the gordon ramsey of game developers. when you enter his kitchen  you cant even make a piece of toast without burning it - but when you leave  you are a masterclass chef. cue miyazakI in the background yelling  its raaaaaaaw!
love your channel! all the devs dunking on elden ring are just jealous.  this game is a masterpiece imo.  I cant put it down!
us old fans feel like we ve been left in the dust .thats how us og ac fans feel about assassin s creed.  youre not alone there.
wouldnt the Christian God be pissed if you play a fantasy about slaying a God
why on earth you need more than 60 fps  most games are fine with 30 fps  but ok  I can understand 60 in first-person games and some third-person
love the witcher 3 name you got there haha
there is a place for cinematic games  but itshouldn t be the default.
p.s. you are officially my favorite youtuber.  someone who talks about tomb raider with passion and God with love   yes  doubly please!
dang  a religious youtuber  thats nice.glad you found her dude
@dimitrI warchief  isn t melonie mac such a treasure   and its dudette  but thanks  man!
modern gamedesign made a  mmo  out of fallout! talking about kicking the basic game feel out of the window.
how the hell is damn hard when people are daily uploading new broken abusive op spell or technique destroying bosses   or even using the sleep arrows are you just leveling hp and stamina
it is hard  if you not expose some mechanics  I play a katana build and at one point it gets brutal.why are you judging anyway whats hard or not for someone just because you look up some builds on the net   doesnt mean others do it.
@hermit card  why would anyone want to ruin a gaming experience by going op from the get go and not have any fun  I can see abusing things after a 1st playthrough  but the first is hella lame. Im currently doing a strength  dex build and not using any summons.
@musicfilmhead90  thats true
@dixiedevil  chill bro  no need to insult.
@dixiedevil  I get you  but come on be the bigger man.
@musicfilmhead90  so  youre complaining the game is so damn hard  and then refusing the tons of op builds  then why complain its damn hard  praise it! the moral of the story is that elden rings provides different paths that modify the difficulty. hell  I even agree with you to the point Imight use daggers and no horse.
@hermit card I never complained it was too hard. youre talking to the wrong guy. difficult  yes  but I enjoy the challenge.
@musicfilmhead90  Ive been doing a dex  faith build with dual katanas for my first playthrough but I started putting points in int due to a certain katana. I ll do the busted op stuff in another playthrough.
and despite being a casual player and being frustrated with the mechanics  I bought all except for elden ring. at least not yet. bought triangle strategy since I am outside more now. just goes to show that even if I only finished all titles once  except ds1  only  their committment to their fanbase was what I respected the most making me contribute. even played ds1 on the switch buying that game twice.
I absolutely love the souls formula  and do want to see more of it from from  but I would like to see them try their hand at something entirely differentI dont know what I d like to see  I d just like to see them have a crack at it
this is my favorite game since I picked up and played hollow knight during the pandemic...
yeah  it feels better dont itI dont play it yet but dragons crien gave me that feelingfighting the ancient dragondying a lot and beating it as the sorcress
agreed!
lmao I said this few days ago to my company in new world about this whole subject. cause Im taking a break from pvp in new world cause of pvp in elden ring
damn dawg  you down bad huh
thatstory about your family into elden ring was so cool. that reminded me of when my parents were really into me playing onimusha 2 when I got my first playstation 2 back in the day. I love the games that are like movies!
I definitely enjoy the isolation and independent lara from the originals. I also enjoy story and dialogue too. I think they both have their place and both are enjoyable for different reasons. I think underworld did a better balance cuz she would only talk to zip and alistor between the gameplay vs chatting the entire level which got really annoying in legend.
I always aim to have as easy of a time with a game that I can if the options are there  but if I know what Im getting into with a certain game  I only have myself to blame. suffice to say ive had a good time with elden ring so far when I rented it..I wont buy it until its cheap though because games like that I dont stick with for extremely long periods of time. God bless sister.
ahh yes  this is why I love the doom community. if id software came in with an easy walking simulator now a days.. they d be shredded.
never fold or apologize to the mob!
I love how open you are with your Christianity. I too have been trying to read the Bible more. keep up the great work. my day is a bit more brighter when I see your videos.
new drinking game! take a shot every time mel says   and all that kind of stuff.    anyway  Ive been a fan of fromsoftware games since king s field.  their games have always been unforgiving  yet very entertaining. when you finish a fromsoft game  you have a great sense of achievement and bragging rights with your friends. their ux and gameplay has always been a little clunky  but thats part of the charm.  the fans accept the bad with the good and absolutely love them for it.
my 13 year old nephew got to play it at my house. when he walked out of the tutorial  he thought it was amazing! he loves botw  and he thought this was a bigger  better looking botw.he beelined it to the tree sentinel to steal his horse. he was pissed in the first little dungeon
have you noticed that there are a lot of japanese developers that just dont give a rip about what the narrative and they develop games they want to play  naokI yoshida  yoshi-p  said something about this in an interview with asmongold  making the comment about activision blizzard s wow developers asking  do they even play their games  its awfully telling that developers in the west dont really care about these kinds of things. ea  activision blizzard  etc. are all  more concerned about how much cash the bring in  and itshows. they dont care about the story or gameplay.
elden ring for me is challenging but I know thats me not the game  Im an ol  fart of 60    but I accept the challenge and elden ring is friggin awesome! its taken me a while to get the memory retention on the controls and Ive spent my first 30hrs running around the first area  limgrave  using it as a tutorial and accumulating runes and levels. last night was the first time I challenged my first boss in the cave... and after a few attempts I conquered tsoab. I know he s the first boss youreally come across  there s a learning curve and world understanding. I love this game!! its a beautiful experience  its so well designed and crafted!I believe elden ring has used extremely clever methods of teaching within a game  wonderful mechanics and the whole thing is crafted to perfection. this open world game has put most if not all the others to shame. this is an amazing world!
hImelonie its great getting see you doing what you been wanting to do.getting out your thoughts  opionsalong with adding wonderful scripture reading Gods words.takecare melonie
hey mel  binge watching your content and glad you have your own channel. will you do a room tour setup one day  thanks
oh aloy was most definitely not nerfed  ran credits the other night and I cantell ya thatshe s still a bad ass and is even a bit prettier in a way. her abs are still there with other outfits throughout the game  you will love the story because its kind blowing  I just think people should be happy that we re getting banger games one after the other and each one is for a different gaming community  I suck at soulsbourne games and I enjoy a more story driven game. this year so far has been amazing for gamers
easy mode before  high hp  high stamina  high defense armor  summon players.easy mode in elden  high hp  high fp  high int  summon players and spam abusive broken op spells.
so I usually try to keep to one comment per video  but you said something that resonated with me hard-core  because Ive been saying it for years. the modern feminist movement  or as I like to call it  femenazism is absolutely doing more harm to women than good. making men weaker in order to make women  stronger  prevents the woman from realizing their true potential. look at all the women that affected history  florence nightingale  betsy ross  harriet tubman  abigail adams  just to name a few...
gameplay combat mechanics wise they havent  but character creator wise they have. which in this perticular game isnt such an issue due to the almost constant wearing of a helmet. never the less the game is fatastic  and really gives me that old school gaming vibe back  before gaming went mainstream and submitted to its whims.
I believe that the game play and the story should go hand and hand and complements each other that help build the overal l exp. also to make the game next level good is when they have good replay ability.
thanks for playing this melonie  really wanted to see how you play
is it exhausting always having the right opinion  you are awesome mel
in these dark times  or colorful times I should say as we re living in clown world  it makes me so happy to see this kind of justice prevail. developers that are everything wrong with modern aaa games  being extremely petty because an actual video game like elden ring is finding massive success and critical acclaim  and completely overshadowing their 15 hour movie games  with 3 hours of that being walk and talk nonsense disguised as gameplay.
kings field  damn  thats a game I would love they remake and update.
@hermit card  I know  right!  always been a sucker for the dungeon-crawlers.
its the same reason why manga is outselling western comics.
@seki09  facts! I dont read manga  but I have watched some anime that are based on manga  and the storytelling is fantastic!maybe I should read more manga
played through horizon aswell  loved it  playing elden ring now and its so different  it takes you back to how games used to be and when I look back at horizon I realize they could have learned a bit from this game to get more out of that world. horizon should take a step away from assassins creed and a step closer to its own identity. minor things  great start of this year for sure
@straken swe  fyI there s a setting that lets you explore without the clutter.
was it the beard
elden ring the fake rpg that misses the point of what an rpg is supposed to be. kind of like new world.
despite the woke stuff and hand-holding they fit into horizon forbidden west  its still an excellent game.  I loved the first one  and this one is even more expansive.  already feels like 3 to 4 times as big  with more puzzles.  Im a more casual gamer  though  and know that elden ring wasn t meant for me.  neither are a lot of other genres  but Im glad they exist to get other people into the games I like.
elden ring being a proper  difficult game is the reason why I finally decided to buy a soulsborne game for the first time. my time playing and completing gow 2018 pretty much also made the decision of choosing elden ring over horizon forbidden west as I want something that doesnt come off as an interactive cinematic like a bunch of modern sony exclusives have become. also  the fans of the soulsborne games are very convincing in marketing the game for fromsoft.not afraid to say I suck at games  but I found the hand holding like the quest markers to actually be immersion breaking. seriously  hard to take searching for supposedly  lost items  to truly be lost when you have a bunch of markers marking the locations of where to find them. that was an issue I had with gow 2018 favors.random comment  thanks for the Bible verses in the end. with the way the last couple of years had been  I appreciate this alot.
game difficulty is a thing I vacillate on. I like a good challenge in a game where the gameplay itself is the point  but Im typically a lot bigger fan of story-driven games. and when it comes to story-focused games  I usually feel they should be just challenging enough to be engaging without getting in the way of the experience. for me  the gameplay is secondary and should facilitate the story rather than hinder it. unfortunately  I dont think many games strike the right balance.
anyone who stands up to the woke mob or any other mob gets respect from me. those that give in and attempt to appease it lose respect. I dont know what the generation breakdown of the subscribers are but I would assume most are millennials  or around 25-35. Im gen x and we are about 45-60 now. we have seen it all. when we were kids pong came out. then came donkey kong  still maybe the hardest game of all time  and pac man. games today may look better but are they more challenging  Ive never known anyone get to the kill screen on dk.
oh wow  I thought she was 25 and married!  so youre saying there s a chance!  and I hope there is not any of that 1 in a million talk. haha a woman of faith with common sense and down to earth. what s not to like!
dang  melonie spittin Christian wisdom. didn t think the road would lead here but glad it did. this was super refreshing. glad I found your content again.
on the relationship note  it is important to say that effort isn t always what you think it is. check out  the five love languages  book. it is Christian focused  but basically everyone  loves  and receives differently. so when you give  effort  in a relationship friendship you have to realize the way the other person is able to receive it. the five love languages  words of affirmation  quality time  receiving gifts  acts of service  and physical touch.
youre so refreshing to listen to...God bless you melonie
as much as I want to see you playing elden ringI kinda want to your dad play it more
everyone has their own choice of genre games. and I  ve a dead hard fan of a good  heavy rpg. and its a plus when its a open world. I love world building  and discovering the world that im in and having meaningful interactions.  and its just sucks that most games now  just have bare bone rpg elements just so the deve can add it to the checklist.
how come elden ring got so difficult   shows off entire catalog of from software games over the past few years
what s funny is that all the people complaining about a lack of easy mode or  accessibility  fail to realize elden ring is the most accessible fromsoft game to date. you have so much at your disposal to make the game easier on yourself if you want  or you cantry and brute force your way through a boss if that tickles your fancy.  all these people really want is a participation trophy. they wanna be able to say they beat a fromsoft game without actually putting in the time and effort to do so.
personally  I think its aloy s hairstyle that makes her face really wide. kind of wish they d given us the ability to change that like we can facepaints. and yes for the amount of acrobatics she does  her arms and abs do not look built very much!  just a slight tone...  but I guess a kassandra type body may have been too big    idk.
its always a plus to see a very  attactive woman that is also a Bible person as well. it just give me more of a want to binge all the videos
I had the exact same feelings about far cry 6. I liked fc5  but with fc6 I collected all of the weapons and gear and unlocked all the bases around the map  but I lost interest when I played the main quest. I have never played a game where every single character is completely and utterly unlikeable. it is a good looking game and the gameplay is fun  but the story and characters seemed like the game was written by 13 year olds. also the main villain was a celebrity and he looked like it  and it ruined the effect of taking him seriously. you should do a video about why celebrities in video games suck.
day 8 of commenting on your videos until g-fuel sponsors me.omg I cant wait to watch you play elden ring. game is freakin  dopeeeee. my only advice is dont let friends ruin it for you. Ive been playing with friends who already have 90  hours in it already when Im only 24 hours in and they keep telling me where to go or what traps and monsters to avoid. dont do that its so much better when you have that feeling of exploration yourself.but I def hate the alory changes. they like bulked her up when she s running 20 miles a day haha.
melanie mac and elden ring content is a purrrfect combo!!
I said it before to a friend who also loves classic tomb raider    I said that it would be incredible for fromsoftware to make a tomb raider game. I think the platforming is only from software would need help with  but I think level design and exploration in dark souls reminded me so much of classic tomb raider
I love the difficulty it really keeps my mind working after long day of work it really makes me forget the earlier part of the day
from software had the best ninja game series ever  tenchu ayame was an awesome female character  with a snarky attitude that was just so fun. granted the series kinda lost its footing at 4 when they tried to jump on the motion control first person view bandwagon of the wiI era. but tenchu 1 to time of the assassin were great games with great gameplay mechanics. I wonder if the button code cheats work on other games  they had one that unlocked everything  another that replenished health  etc.
its damn near impossible to find a single game that ticks all your personal boxes perfectly  and a very special thing when a game even gets close to that for you.
people like you should just enjoy and watch a full gameplay through.
its definitely from s  most easiest to cheese  game to date. you can use the terrain to your advantage on many of the bosses  but this requires critical thinking and game journos aren t great at that
yup. I suck  and Ive beaten almost every fromsoft game. ranged builds  npc and player summons  etc. are how you do  easy mode . there isn t an option in a menu  you have to be resourceful and use all of the tools at your disposal  maybe a little level grinding  to give yourself a leg up.
@12ealdeal  yep. I rolled a samuraI first and got my ass whooped. I rerolled mage and used the terrain to my advantage. this takes away the fun though. haha
didn t she also have a beard
@patrick henry  kassandra  I dont think so !
love your Bible verses reminds me of another Christian over 40 years ago on of all places cnn they had a celebrity chef graham kerr the galloping gourmet who did short segments of recipies and he insisted on a Bible verse at the end of each just like you keep up the good work
Ive subscribed. I value your perspective. keep on doing your thing
spitting straight facts. love to see it!
you talking about challenging older games and your love for them brings back memories of tenchu. a different strong pair of characters in rikimaru and ayame!!you can say Ive been mac d as your memories of older games makes me think that youre so sick  like sent home from school!!
I am a big fan of divinity original sin. it by no means holds your hand  requiring the player to explore both the world and dialog options. it is that deep involvement yields a truly rewarding game experience. good game design should provide  basic  instruction on hw to play  but should never hold your hand from beginning to end. often  game designers  will create shallow systems meant to create the illusion of accomplishment. I call it fast food gaming.
speaking of aciI  the only reason I didn t beat the main game in less than a day is because I collected everything and completed every side quest before hitting up the main missions.
Im making my eldin ring character look like lara croft.  I wish you the best of luck with that lol. if you figure it out  would you please post how you did it
from software is the best game developer in the industry. from the dark souls franchise to bloodborne  sekiro and now elden ring. not a single miss in the bunch. I hope they never change up their recipe.
found you a couple days ago  love the content. didn t know you were into elden ring  where can I catch the stream
souls games are definitely not supposed to be easy I feel games that are hard like these are a lost art I remember Lords of magic being a struggle but so worth actually earning that victory and learning the game with every failure.
from software always make great games. I remember being a part of a clan on chromehiunds in xb360  that was awesome.
I actually did the same in elden ring  only I tried to get my character as close to erdwin from dq3 11
elden ring got me hyped for gaming again.
my  easy mode  for elden ring would be my grinding. at least some effort is being put in to overcome a problem even though it may not be as head on.
the soulsbornering franchise will always be a pinnacle in my gaming library for obvious reasons.
elden ring beat botw2 for most anticipated game. in my opinion it deserved to win.from software puts other game companies to shame.they build their games for the fans  not journalists.journalists should have no influence on how games turn out.
Im getting zero dawn the complete version in a about a week just waiting on it to be delivered from amazon.  marc the cyborg proves there s a easy way to get a very powerful sword early in the game  and farm levels to be able to use it within 90 minutes of starting the game which can make the game very fun.  awesome yellow outfit and 2 verses of day very cool    Imet my wife 10 years ago mar 7th 2012 when I was 40 so it ll happen when it happens.
I remember the good old days of games with no difficulty settings  when you hit the wall you either git gud  go back and grind to brute force your way through  or find a guide  as for accessibility these days I find myself needing a good pc port after a work accident left my left thumb kinda useless  Ive been told for elden ring the pc controls need a remap and some learning but are very useable
happy international women s day  mel! ... keep representin !... youre doin  it right...
none of my dreams in life have worked out the way I wanted... I cant say that I enjoy that  but it taught me humility and stoicism.  thru pain I have learned to comfort suffering men.  seneca
thing is that is any rpg. this is not.
hello melanie  have you played gravity rush 1 and 2 games  those are amazing games with a cute female protagonist made from studios from japan which I recommend. gravity rush 2 is such a unique game and my personal favorite ps4 game if you want to play something a bit more different than many of the aaa games.
my favorite games are the ones that will slap you around with no discrimination. overcoming challenges are a major reason why I game.
I dont know man. when they said they made aloy look more masculine because she looked too feminine before and like she d cry when she broke a nail...thereby claiming feminity equals weakness...I was out. people who talk and think like that dont deserve my money.
the early development of video games were always about the developer making games they would like to play.  normies at the time didn t play them and thought they were not cool.  dynamic game play is always first  graphics  sound  cinematics  and even story are all tools to support game play.  I haven t bought a aaa game since anno 1800 most of the stuff I play has a track record of game play excellence.  and it is amazing how fun indie games can be if you have steam etc and are patient enough to look for them.
guerrilla games had such a good thing going for them they made some great games and now this one guy has to throw shade and ubisoft has to join in. they just needs to appreciate what the create and what they have earned and stay in their lane not worry about what the other guy is doing and start throwing shade. Im embrassed for them.
you can make elden ring into a great workout routine  for example every time I die I do 10 push-ups. sadly my skill level is game journalist  so my arms are pretty jacked now.
even the trailers for games nowadays are 90-100  cutscenes.
difficulty is what gives meaning  -- this is an axiom of life that few young people today embrace.
Im more of a ninja gaiden player  but I also have enjoyed nioh ii. Ive been into overcoming the game mechanics since gunvalkyrie. that game didn t allow me to cheat. it was great.
I personally dont play these games too hard for me and I like the cinematic movie types with stories but this is a good thing though.
now you made me look forward to a tomb raider with the mechanics of og souls game. no big cutscenes. no rpg mechanics. just 1 big ass tomb with interconnecting areas everywhere.
I think even souls games could have something approaching a  not-as-hard  difficulty without having any negative impact for anyone who wants the full challenge. I dont see where the problem is. just make it a choice that you have to make when you start the game  and that you cant change  and that has some consequences  e.g. some trophies achievements not being obtainable  some cool in-game gear not being obtainable  and possibly even some areas of the game and or some bosses not being available. but for some reason  a lot of people react super-sensitive to this topic  as if this was a religious issue  and Im sure I ll have the pitchforks coming for me now...
if it is story based then I dont mind it being easy but the higher the climb the more rewarding the view.
taking the time to sit down  read  and enjoy our time on earth is so important. Ive had a difficult year s  as well but Im living my best life.
I seriously love this game
I cant wait to play this game.  I just need money...and a computer that will handle it.the  accessibility  factor has killed games.  I get the most satisfaction out of beating a game that I had to work hard on and work through.  not every form of media has to be for everyone.
maybe I should start playing this game to see how good it is go boom
oh man  a souls like tomb raider would be so sick
I beat elden ring about 12 hours ago  great game
thanks for the Bible read at the end. its much appreciated mel!
expect early rpg video games are based on d d game play where leveling  story  and stats meant something.now just fallow daark souls because who cares about story and leveling.
difficulty in an rpg should be based on leveling not if you learned how to dodge.elden ring dark souls etc want to be rpgs then leveling understanding how to level and story are the most important parts.the git gud is the dumbest thing I have ever heard from fake rpg fans.
@evacody124  if you had ever bothered to play elden ring  you d know that you can absolutely just level your character up to make combat easier  even trivializing bosses.
they are also usually too hard for me too  all the souls games  but I think I ll buy this one at some point.there s lots of guides on youtube to begin and get stuff without fighting anyone  and get enough within 2 hours to feel strong for the rest of the game. its always at the beginning that its too hard.
elden rewards the resourceful if the typical melee combat to difficult on its own. can go mage spam to death everything  hit and run with horse  use bleed freeze weapons  spam ranged items or arrows - run repeat. also the use of spirits are real useful to for the solo offline player. and you can always invite a random or friend to coop with to help you through the battles. that all said honestly Ive really been only into japanese games since its one of the few high developed games that aren t sjw infected as western ones seem to be. hard to play any western games and I not want to face palm or roll my eyes at things I see that are clearly sjw decisions. just takes me out of the games world. the world of elden rings and all fromsoft games have characters of many types and it just feels like everything fits together in a believable cohesive world. other games nowadays always feel like modern politics and drama are seeped into their design and itsucks.
appreciate the scriptures  as usual. those are good points.
member having to talk to friends irl about game puzzle s Imiss the 90s
I felt the same way about video games back when I pre-ordered skyrim and got it on 11 11 2011 and yeah its still a game I really liked but I also always wonder why they made it the way they did. you almost have to have mods to enjoy it. long story short I quit playing games after that and started learning game development  now I can make games the way I want them to be  make my own game content and so on. thats how we defeat the system.
I believe I heard the dev of tomb raider state that they were focusing on a younger lara  and allowing us to experece her growing into  this badass sexy killing machine. being a writer myself I  love backstory being apart of the growth. I want to understand why she is the way she is and what caused her to be this way.  now with saying this. im totally against making any good woke. for the simple facts the wokers aren t going to play the game make likely and giving into the wokies demands  just water down the game they suck. and resulting in shit market numbers.
I literally bought horizon and slogged through it until I got my hands on elden ring. haven t touched the horizon since
hidetaka miyazakI is gonna make what he wants to make regardless of what people think. if he didn t go against mainstream we wouldn t have demon s souls much less the rest of the fromsoft franchises. the reason is playstation wanted an oblivion clone and miyazakI decided to make what he wanted in secret instead and thats how we got demon s souls.
I love the game so much.
elden ring has many flaws but for some reason most of them are overlooked and the game is still enjoyed I think thatspeaks volumes
I agree   I dont  like everything  it gives games more variety . I haven t played any dark souls   I tried demon souls s3 couldn t get into it didn t bother with the dark souls through lack of time  but I loved the onimusha games ps2  which are quite hard  and platinumed nioh and bloodborne so I will get them eventually. complaining about no easy mode when there are guides.  give me a break.
21 45 it has reached at least one person. time-stamping in case I revisit this in the future  and need that reminder again. Im glad things are going well for you.
finished revelation today!starting genesis tomorrow!keep it up mel!
I like hearing your takes on the Bible... Im not that into souls like games though...
to be honest  I never could get into the souls games. not because they are too hard. they are all very formulaic. I d rather have another tenchu. sekiro was supposed to be tenchu but then they were saying   ah fuck it were doing the same thing with minor gameplay changes and call itsekiro . and elden ring is just a culmination of all predecessors with an open world.but I do have to say that I like the dark fantasy theme. I definitely could have more of that.I think you are really cool melonie. I totally would hang out with you  play games or hit the gym.
I feel stronger now.
going by your description  nu lara sounds like solid snake in the jungle  as opposed to classic lara  who was samus aran in boy shorts.
Ive got the original tomb raider trilogy on psn just ready to go. Ive only played the first game back when it was new  pc port actually . it was one of the games my friend used to show off his playstation but he never really let me play it.
as someone thatsucked badly at the original tomb raider game and hasn t really played much of the souls series and sucked at games that were like it like nioh  I think a souls like tomb raider game would actually be awesome.  from what Ive seen of various summaries and lets-plays of said game  tomb raider had some elements that would be very worthy of a souls like title.  she venture s into far-off  veritably mysterious landscapes  fought powerful otherworldly beings that could have easily killed her in short order like souls bosses.some interesting interesting rpg mechanics can be explored in the type of setting with the types of weapons she can acquire.  it would be interesting if the ammunition diversity of the shotgun could be explored  I rarely see games explore that beyond having one or two other ammunition types like incendiary rounds or slugs.  there s freaking grenade rounds for them. and some people make their own loads like loading for each shell  which gameplay wise can open up opportunities for either usage in certain puzzles or having specialized effects on enemies or heightened effectiveness toward enemies that might be invulnerable to conventional weaponry.  something like that along with some weapon customization or gunsmithing to change the way the gun works in the game.some interesting plot points of either the main or side variety could be lara being transported to some mysterious alien world or realm of existance  or be affected by some sort of pseudo-vampirism or lycanthropy  or something that is slowly changing corrupting her body mind in some way that could offer up some gameplay abilities   somewhat like samus in metroid prime 2  echoes and kind of in metroid  dread.  hope the devs of tomb raider or some indie studio interested in making a tr title like this  have a similar idea along with not including the anti-everything politics that the mainstream media force-feeding everyone
while Im glad they dont gimp their own gameplay  their publisher still made them bend the knee with body type a   b because words with meaning are terrifying  male   female .
yet ubisoft failed to mention that a great many players couldn t progres in the story for an entire month  because the lady youre supposed to talk to decided to date a dirt nap infront of her troops. ubisoft is in a steep decline lately  and Ive pretty much given up on them.
I d like to know what these flaws are  people keep speaking of them and yet Ive not seen anyone mention what they are. they only bring us stuff like the game design thats inherent to the soulsborne style of game. of pc performance issues  of which Ive only had one that was related to the game bugging out
it needs more performance optimization.  other than that I havent found any flaws that break the experience for me! I love it!
yeah I was disappointed in that too..  they also go out of their way to make the armor in the game gender neutral.  there are very few armor sets that make the female character look feminine.
I just excited you can actually jump in a fromsoftware souls-style game. this feels just like with world of warcraft beta came out and you could finally jump in an mmorpg!!
its very reflective of the society we live in. everyone wants instant gratification and isn t prepared to work for towards something.
Im curious melonie  how many marriage proposals do you average per video lol
morning mel!  I wonder what kind of build she will go for
not everything has to be for everyone thats how it is  how it was and always will be   hopefully
hey mel I just want to tell you that I have read the overview ratings of the elden ring video game and I thought that it would be a great video game to buy and to play video game with yourself or with your family or friends and so I just want to tell you that I recommend you and everyone else to go out and buy the game and play this video game and enjoy the game too  ok mel. anyway I just want to tell you that I do hope you enjoy my thoughts and my comments on each of your topics of your videos on your new youtube channel  ok mel. anyway hope you have a wonderful and great blessed day and evening at home with your pets mel.
its japanese culture to apologise and be humble.
I kinda  wish they d fold a bit  Im tired of dying. dying a lot. Im starting to dream  you died .
hey the south park games have been good though I guess they might just be a publisher on those games. I thought bryce I think was fun granted I haven t played the original tomb raider games but I was also coming over from 007 so that made sense to me thatshe would have her own in house rnd for some of her gadgets.
aaa game devs looking for affirmation of their weak design choices.I remember playing games where I had to draw my own maps  keep my own notes  figure out puzzles with a pen and paper and a lot of thought. it was all doable and so rewarding when I finished the game. I dont need my hand held as long as the game is well designed. in most modern games I prefer to turn off the uI and immerse myself in the game and my character.
I sort of agree that the tweets were a bit much but youtube drama pile on over it has been even more cringe imo.  if I give a gracious interpretation of the first tweet its kind of cute and subtle criticism mixed in has a fair bit of truth to it.   p  the second comment just comes across as a frustrated player though it is a fair issue everyone was dinging them fore at launch.  the third comment was where I started thinking thinking  okay come on this a bit much  but at this point it was just kind of becoming a game playing off the previous comments.  none of these devs actually indicated their distain or jealously for elden ring s success and likely weren t really making statements intended to be analyzed by the world.
this doesnt surprise me. no one wants to have to work for anything. people are too comfortable nowadays and when something difficult comes their way they panic
oh sweet - I need to see this game - Ive got people asking me to play this
they built their entire reputation off making hard games  if they had an easy mode slider they would not have been able to build the reputation they thrive on  it would just be like any other publisher at that point
you should title your lara croft elden ring play through as the real tomb rider on twitch
society is trying to no longer teaching critical thinking  nor are people rewarded for achievement. we now live in a participation trophy era. people are not trained to think  nor are they willing to work hard for a reward. they want to be entertained with little to no effort.
melonie  me again. I need prayer from you and your group of praye warriors. I am going through a trying time. temptation is knocking  so hard. I know temptation is not  sin. but giving into it is.  thank you all.
I got my ass kicked in elden ring a lot last night and it was glorious.
throwing shade on someone s success is never a good look. and because Im such a stickler for  character   its insurance against me ever buying another title from them.  edit  and I bet they re all playing er right now.
are you going to try and recreate lars croft in elden ring
having a dedicated jump button is nice. no more having to sprint jump
what was the last action rpg you played not name skyrim or witcher  me it was grim dawn. rpg fans are fine with working towards something.  what we dont want is platforming game with no story and no hits about puzzles or anything. elden rings like the souls games are marketed as action rpgs. they are not. action rpgs dont have dodge and block. I can just see people like you and mel play grim dawn or path of exile and get mad at not being able to dodge the boss. like in dark souls.
@evacody124  Ive been playing rpg s for years pal  from the original baldurs gate  bard s tale  neverwinter nights and icewind dale through to the modern games  like bg3  dos2  da series and others.  fo4 does not feel like an rpg.
my original playthrough of the original demon souls  I died multiple times to the very first goon  as I hadn t played an arpg like itsince ocarina of time lol.finally beating the game was such a rush after being so brutalized.
it was ok till Imet malekith.he wiped the floor with me.
I love the og tomb raider games  very challenging   I agree as well that the older ps consoles were a lot more fun than todays aaa games
having been involved with game development in the past  my take is that aaa devs think they solved  game making  to the point that the only things that change are bigger worlds and better graphics  but the guts are still the same. just look at ubisoft games  they literally feel like they come from an assembly line.  treat all your players like  tards  is one of the rules  because they want to expand the playerbase to an unrealistic level   accessibility  is just a convenient excuse.louder devs on twitter are extremely clickish and ego driven too so when this janky game from an  outsider  comes out and steals the spotlight I wasn t surprised to see so much salt.
fromsoftware is the way.1- establish a stone identity.2- recognize your true fans and audience.3- love them  please them  they are more than your customers.4- do not sacrifice your personality and fans to go mainstream.5- let the loser devs go rrrrrreeeeee  enjoy the salt.
I wish games like dark souls and x-com had difficulty options  cheat codes  stuff I love from classic doom and halo...but if they dont  they dont  and its probably not a game for me because my skills have not improved in like  30  years. if anything  less challenging games are more challenging for me now. xd
so do not fear  for I am with you  do not be dismayed  for I am your God. I will strengthen you and help you  I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.  isaiah 41 10. this is the stuff that gets me through it. we cultivate out soul through our works to glorify him. stay the course my friends. we will win in the end.
metroid dread is a must play melonie it gives u that old metroid feeling the throw your controller feeling
I d rather watch someone play elden ring  or its sister games  then actually play one. its the dodge parry riposte mechanic of fighting  but thats just me.
so I have been looking for inspiration to pick the next game to play and stream. just finished watch dogs. I think Imight pop in tomb raider. I own rise of and shadow of on xbox one. originally purchased for my wife  she enjoyed them but never streamed them.
ha!  as a old  very casual gamer  fps   I love the old games that had God mode cheats for single play.   never really good but liked playing.
glad you also know the Lord. we need more Christian women to heal stand for what s right.
its nice to hear a female perspective on gaming that is not pushing an agenda  but rather truth and logic with a level head. thank you for your videos keep them coming
these game developers jealous of elden ring s success sound like the writers who are jealous of brandon sanderson s successful kickstarter campaign   26 million for four books as of this writing . instead of trying to figure out why elden ring is so successful with fans or why sanderson is able to get more than 100 000 people to buy in to his secret book release  they d rather throw shade. its easier to be jealous than it is to up your game!
almost 25k subs. push  baby! push!! celebrate for 25k!!
I laugh at players complaining about game difficulty  then start every new game on beginner lol
bit late to the party but maybe fromsoftware should make the next tomb raider game
okay I know I need to read my Bible more often that where I struggle hard nice to hear Im not the only 35 year old that is single.
dang! openly talking about Jesus and admitting to being Christian! brave. keep being open and firm in your belief. pray often.
both type of games should exist hard and easyI like games like mass effect and witcher  games where u can make ur own story and multible ending  witcher I play in normal mode
these days usually if theres a harder difficulty  I choose that from the get go because normal is just so  friggin  easy  in most games. then I run into games like nier automata and doom and fuck myself over by selecting the hardest difficulty. lulreason I like games like dark souls is because of the difficulty. it feels much more rewarding playing it. I do like chill games  and I do like taking it easy at times  but not everything works well as a chill game. I wont bother with some games because they make me go like  whats the point  Im just clicking through it with no skill required. might as well just make the game into a movie. I wont watch it  but it would make it even easier for the player  and less of a bother.I haven t gotten around to horizon zero dawn yet  but  they took away her abs   isn t she like a super active character  ffs... hate stuff like that. gimme my sexy fit action heroes  they re more believable than the regular joe action heroes. if the character is gonna be running around  doing all kinds of athletic feats  fighting people  and battling creatures  I like it better if they look like it too.I seem to like asian dev companies better. they dont seem to pay much attention to twitter idiots. at least thats what it feels like. I dont know Im not on twitter. and I dont mean everyone on twitter is an idiot ofc  Im talking about the mobs getting upset over every little thing. xd
if a game is going to be marketed as a specific genre then there something a heavy focus on those things. and devs need to quit trying to have as more genre mixes. because it then ends up with being a luke warm game that really doesnt leave an  lasting impression. these remind me of action movies that have very little story development and just keep the non stop action to going so the viewer doesnt realize that the movie is very shall.
thats the way of all the old and dead developers... old bungie  old blizzard  old rare  etc.r.i.p. old rare.
for those who want a easy dark souls game  just play code vein  Im pretty bad at souls games and I beaten that game so its a good title for souls beginners
I would play a fromsoft tombraider.
great  great game. its tearing my asshole asunder  but a great game.
dear melonie. its not called  easy mode ... you can use  game journalist mode  in stead
ubisoft is weird af. their employees seem to have more opinions than congress.
its not a from soft game if its not punishing
God s plan
I would love to play elden ring but Im afraid it would piss me off worse then what madden and nba 2k does
some people like playing challenging games because they like to challenged
admittedly Im not much of a gamer because Im totally blind. however I am extremely observant. and the one thing that I have observed it is that if you want a game to have any kind of longevity you need to consider the idea that its not going to be for everybody. are there very easy games that people can play  absolutely. but let s face it  games like dark souls  elden ring  and demon souls are very difficult for a very specific reason. they re  not trying to appeal to a wide general audience. they re trying to appeal to a very specific market. I am a musician  I play guitar. not every single musician is going to be able to play the guitar. I wouldn t want or expect every single musician to want to play the guitar. that would just be boring.
the people complaining about the lack of easy modes probably have glass cases full of participation trophies.
35!!! no way seriously you appear way younger!!
my most anticipated games this year is legend of zelda breath of the wild 2 and hollow knight 2 silksong.
I stopped playing assassin s creed because they got so easy they re boring.  ac1 and 2 were so fun.  fighting was complicated  the puzzles were pretty hard.  ac3 and newer are just boring.  I dont make it to the end before Im like meh.  edit   like you said later in the video.
what youre talking about today  melonie  reminds me of something.  so many people feel abandoned by God  or that God is up there in heaven and he doesnt participate directly within our lives or creation.  they say  oh I pray and I pray  and I read the scripture  and I go to church  and Im in a state of grace  and I seek rest in God  but... nothing .  similarly  I remember when I was in the military there was a battle buddy of mine who said how he wishes for the God of the old testament  whom was omnipresent  seemingly  with a big booming voice from the sky  or a pillar of smoke by day and of fire by night  or in the walls of water when he parted the red sea  etc.  and thats when it dawned on me   the reason why people feel so abandoned by God is because they have either built up such a big expectation  or no expectation at all  of him that when he does present himself  when he does answer  when he does bless you with grace in response to your prayer  that they fail to see it due to some preconceived notion in their mind of God.  it reminds me of that verse where isiah was waiting for God   there was an earthquake  a fire  a great wind  but God was in none of these  rather he was in the small  still voice following them.  Im indeed of the firm conviction that God is always there  for those who draw near to him  and that he always answers our prayers.  however  the manner in which he draws near to us  how he answers our prayers  we have to let go of our own expectations  our preconceived notions  aka  vanity   to see them  we need to silence our hearts  our minds  draw away from all the noise of daily life  and there we will hear him in thatsmall  still voice.  or  to put it another way  I think it was einstein thatsaid  coincidence is God taking direct participation in our life  but doing so anonymously .  indeed  it is in the hidden that God reveals himself.  we must never forget how much we are loved by God  even if we refuse to love him.  he loves us  regardless  as we are created  all of us  in his image  good and holy.  and we know that by reflecting upon our own very nature.  so in those times of spiritual drought  as it were  where we dont want to read our Bible  etc.  we need to be all the more active in our faith  recalling the lesson of job  otherwise  yes  we will know when God draws away from us as we draw away from him.  pax melonie!  another great video!
theres actually a lotta similarities between souls games n classic tomb raider. souls would be right up ur alley imo.
I will buy the game
I hope the souls games just get even less forgiving as we keep going. Ive found elden ring to be much easier than other souls games  maybe thats just me.
boomer stand up ohhhh I just realized Im old now lol
100  on board with this  I want a game in my game not press button to win crap like assassin s creed is probably the worst where just hold down button to climb anything and just follow the minImap....   the funny thing is that you point out the ps2 era as being the end of this and youre right but its when this was ushered in and games suddenly became narrative driven crap and no game could be too hard to beat anymore  in other words its when the normies came in with their millions of dollars and suddenly ruined everything.... I had a point and now Im just rambling... good vid!!!
its not that bad honestly. as long as you know you are going to die a lot. to just about anything. youre free to explore and explore you should.
or maybe and hear me out rpg fans are getting sick of souls like games effecting there rpgs. I want a leveling system that means something. I want a story. and I dont want to be punished for exploring or playing how I want to play. elden ring is just a pointless minds game where you kill everyone. why are you there
yep. complete one city s quest and move to the next. complete the same quests. repeat..
I think this is the best game I have played since breath of the wild. I think a hard difficulty while not needed to be a good game it can add to the experience. but I cantell you what makes a bad game. if your main focus is the story. cant tell you how much I hate the modern sony exclusives. for this reason
Im just a guy that likes puzzle or word games.
you want easy mode   there are external cheat programs you can use if you honestly want easy mode.
the main problem is that main stream media want the jop   but dont want to do the work. I dont think they really like hard games   no problem but dont get mad at me because I do!!!
elden ring looks way too hard. as a 30  year old gamer  I just wanna see some cool shit...I can barely beat super mario sunshine without save states
u speak really well melo
japan and korea do know what gamers want but the west doesnt. or am I wrong
I really dont like being led by the nose when a play a game. being led by the nose just defeats the purpose of an open world. devs be like. let s make this massive ope. world but put the players on rails so they dont explore.
alloy looks like nikocado avocado  I am 100  checked out at this point because nothing good comes from decisions made by people who think making a character ugly is good design
I loved zero dawn too  so I was really excited for forbidden west. honestly though  they made aloy just a cold and annoying bitch on top of the visual changes. I played it and beat the story  which wasn t as good as the first  but didn t bother getting the platinum like I did in zero dawn because it just wasn t enjoyable and aloy just annoyed me to listen to. elden ring on the other hand has surpassed all of my expectations  and Ive been a huge fan since demon souls originally came out. the world is gorgeous  game play is tight and amazing and you just want to explore to find all the hidden caves and quests. Ive spent over 100 hours in elden ring so far and probably 2 3 through the main story and still loving every minute of it. and running around with friends killing bosses is better than ever.
hidetaka myiazakI giving 0 shits about what people think. making his own games. doing his thing.the one thing you maybe could fault him for is liking berserk too much. but on second thought  can youreally
what time is your stream
nah some games should be hardcore so its a challengeanything achieved without challenge isn t an achievementps if ubI devs wanna be useful they can fix the cheater issue in r6s
since youre a fan of tomb raider  did you and your brother ever played silent hill 1-3  1 on sony playstation 1  2-3 on sony playstation 2
the problem with the game journalists moaning that games are too hard.  I would expect the absolute minimal qualification to talk about games  is to actually be able to play the games you are reporting on.  this whole problem is basically games journalists etc not being qualified to do their job so they complain to lower the bar down to where they can play it easily.  regarding others that complain games are too hard... well  in the early days of console etc gaming  these whiners would have been literally devoured by the games of yesteryear.
never cater to causal audience for they are transitory. the move from game to game sheerly by what their friend plays. as razorfist said  to court a casual audience is to lose a casual audience.
sounds like games today  are like books that have  alot of pictures
3 God is not silent. he is having his communications intercepted by evil men.
God can be your friend but to have a friend you need to know his name do you  melonie.
clearly you should be in charge of the next tomb raider. I bet you ld fix the franchise lol. go boom! oh and get your gfuel using code  mac
west developers know.. they would just rather push their ideology.
no. bersek is definitely worthy.
never turn away from what makes an rpg and rpg.
its not a mob  its a hierarchy. if you do not score big on the progressive stack or have a high social creditscore  you are canceled!
this is what Imean when I say that game developers these days are lazy. I dont care how many hours and money you spend on graphics  animations  physics or dialogues. if your game is designed around hints and quest markers in a way that you cant even complete some quests if you disable them  coff coff every modern eidos montreal game coff coff   your game is lazy  because youre skipping the process of producing relevant engaging gameplay.
finale a twitch a stream ! yah
hey  dont knock storytelling. for rpg s the story is more important than gameplay and gfx.
ok I ll try to read my Bible more
ubisoft devs critisize elden ring s ux  what  it must be a joke  right
Ive been struggling to read my Bible often.  Christ is king!
cute
as an older gamer I concur.  games now a days are all about look how shiny it is. you pay  60 for a game and then rattle through it in 2 hours. this is why games like valheim and project zomboid explode  they are hard  and its all about gameplay. having played fallout 2  fallout 3 was a new but enjoyable switch. new vegas restored the grittiness of the franchise and tnen fo4 went and completely dumbed down the game!!
at 6 43 and you call us boomers !
my mighty battlemage darlem shall never fall. I saw a lot of horizon forbidden west devs are butt hurt because elden ring is doing great while their game is an overpriced dlc .
games development has mostly turned away from making challenging and intricate experiences  and instead turned towards making them  simple  and  fluidly paced .you know its a bad sign when  pacing  becomes the biggest design focus and not puzzles  enemies  or even art style. pacing is the last thing that comes to mind. players play at their own pace.
yeah  dont remind me
I never liked the souls games. thus  I play other games. there s 20 new games per day on steam  not counting the myriad of indies that get no advertisement . its so easy today to find other games to play... come on wokies  you can do it!
I despise cut scenes and  plots . just give me combat.
the funniest thing about all of this is the devs that it revolves aroundnot only have japanese developers largely given up on making games for western appeal  but like... shuheI yoshida himself  former president of sony computer entertainment worldwide studios   hated demon s souls  famously saying   this is crap. this is an unbelievably bad game. granted yes  fromsoft has made many improvements to their approach and design since then  2009   but demon s souls was a playstation exclusive  and the president of sce was talking shit on it and still they did not sway from their visiona bunch of nobodies on twitter dont mean shit to miyazakI and the fromsoft team and that by itself is not only praiseworthy  but part of why they consistently deliver bar-setting gamesIm a bit biased but God bless  japanese creators of every medium are blazing trails through this period of creative neutering and sterilization and I adore them for itthe jealousy and bitterness of western devs creatives is only going to increase as anime  manga  and japanese games continue to absolutely bury western  efforts
gamers now  this game too hard! make it easier!me  an actual terrible gamer  man. I need to get gud.
former and current ea and blah blah people were angry at elden ring for being uber successful I bought 3 God damn copys! Im most pleased with the game though Im still not buying a ps5 till the price isn t a God damn computer price. I ll just build my new pc with that instead lol
I started darksouls three days ago with a total of 20 hours played and Ive yet to ring the bells. Ive beat  100   wolfenstein on uber mode for both ferguson and wyatt and it took me only 1 5 of that time.
35  man I would not have guessed that....
dude the fall out games like elder scrolls are action rpgs where you go out explore and level up to fight the bosses this game like dark souls are not only not rpgs they dont play like them. they are platform games.stop putting platform games elements in my rpgs.if you dead in a diablo like game it was not due to lack of skill. it was due to lack of leveling up. what s the point of leveling up or getting better gear in elden ring or the souls game if I get punished for messing up a movment  in combat  thats not how it works in rpgs that qas never how to worked in rpgs.
I wasn t comparing the games  I was comparing the way games are dumbed down.  fo4 was dumbed down with the whole perks system.
@andy waterworth    an rpg having perks wow Imean let s just take away the whole leveling system of rpgs. Imean who needs to spend time fighting to get more levels. no throw that out the window.in fact let s take away everything that d d did for rpgs because who needs it. oh wait every true rpg fan who gets pissed thatsouls elements are in effecting there rpgs. Im sure you would be blast at playing co op with bg3.
@evacody124  you ve misinterpreted what I said  im fine for having tags  or certain perks  but the fo4 got it completely wrong. in the earlier series you tag a skill and put points into it and had to earn the rewards. you get a suit of power armour within 5 mins of the game starting for real.  playing bg3 is a blast actually in co-op  in much the same way as dos2. Im all for perks if used properly. fo4 just got made easy  even on hard mode. when hard mode is just increasing the bullet sponge of enemies.
shuheI loves bloodborne though  so they must have listened.
people dont even know about otogImyth of demons  thatshit needs re-released  I played the demo so much back in the og xbox demo disc era.
this guy gets it! remember thatsense of self development and accomplishment when you finally got gud
@some guy  lol nope. I still suck. I just keep getting back up
I dont think you understand why there are quest logs and or map markers in rpgs these days. let me explain. early rpgs on computers lacked the power to do that. it was either have good game play and story or have the other stuff. the other stuff being maps  etc. you see the used to have full maps that would come with the games. and you would mark and have a quest log for everything. well rpgs of western rpgs at some point got sick of doing that and the developers saw that computer hardware was getting more powerful so they added those into the game.thats not hand holding the quality of life so you dont have to look through notes just to figure out where the heck you are if you left the game for some time.
oh these modern game  journalists  would hate the kings field series
as another note... Im pretty disturbed by the amount of people who lose their minds if a person talks about their religion  specifically if its Christianity . as long as that person isn t forcing that religion on others  there is literally zero issue with it. Im an atheist but Im not and anti-theist. I can see the good that beliefs like Christianity can do for people.being outraged at a person s personal belief is really messed up imo. but I guess Im not surprised that authoritarian wokists who literally want to throw people in prison for thoughts  are the people so offended by the religious. these people are a cancer encroaching on our freedoms.

I know I be joking around a lot in your comments  but this time Im serious.Im a believer myself from way back. however  I have my fair share of regrets and mistakes.now Im in bad health and a lot of pain. Im kind of scared and worried for my loved ones.since I know youre a true believer girl  Im asking you to please pray for me okay. thank you
how long is your new channel not new
I play hardcore doom and rts on the hardest difficulties with no issue and that is not for everyone  just like any from software games are not for me I just find them frustrating to the max.. they dont need to dumb games down  like fans of a game have what they want and not dumb down games for the sake of some whiney journo twitter  gamers .
monster hunter fan here. know what you mean. mh is still okay  but its not so much about the hunt anymore. no more preparation  no need to observe and learn from mistakes. just do flashy moves until the monster dies. much easier than the old games and you practically get showered by rewards now. youre not so much a hunter in a harsh world as you are a seriously overpowered anime protagonist - including saying some tacky shit when pulling off attacks.I still love mh as a whole  but it definitely has catered to the short-attention-span  dopamine addicted  press x to be awesome  casual audience. on top of that  the inclusion of microtransactions for stuff you used to earn by completing difficult quests isn t making it any better either. Im not sure if I d bother with the next one.
fromsoft has also become mainstream in the sense that they are already just copy   pasting  even having anor londo assets in sheldon ring  bazinga. the cod of souls-likes 69 10  too much derivation.
Ive noticed you are trying to grasp meaning from the Bible. I think you are benefiting from the verses for yourself as much as us
I ll say it again  companies owe nothing to you. it is up to you to justify buying the product they re offering.
what is  mainstream   the lowest common denominator  or is perhaps  the desire for a difficult game actually mainstream  I know it was when I was a kid playing my intellivision...
sis real talk  how many different colored wifebeaters   jackets do you have in your closet  more on the subject  I agree with your perspective  adversity in games is healthy  because if you cant beat it  you usually go outside   do something productive  then come back   practice at the game until you beat it  which can feel good  especially when the game is satisfying on the eye s   gameplay  controls can be a thing  but me personally if the game is fun  ill adapt  slaves of the world  worship money   thats what this is clearly about  anyway God bless   stay safe.
I am playing horizon 2 forbidden west I am enjoying it. I have been playing ut slowly because I am trying to platinum trophy it
the only tomb raider game I didn t like as much was rise of the tomb raider. it looked like they were battling internally with some in-house sjw s over her appearance  as every scene lara croft looked like a completely different person. none of these looks actually felt like lara croft. her face was munted and her body was too chubby and masculine.
I thought aloy pretty much looked the same.   guess not
games that focus primarily on gameplay are fun while you are playing them but I dont find them very memorable. I still remember sora turning into a heartless in kingdom hearts 1  sora  riku and kairI reuniting in kingdom hearts 2  killing bastila in star wars kotor  the speech on virmire in mass effect 1  scooter s death in tales of the borderlands  tidus finding out that yuna has to sacrifice herself to stop sin  and aerith s death in final fantasy vii. I got the platinum in bloodborne and I dont remember a single thing about that game.I do agree that games were better back in the earlier generations. devs now seem to focus too much on graphics and making games  bigger . a lot of games today just feel like mindless entertainment like mcu movies. even sequels to these classic games like mass effect andromeda or kingdom hearts 3 are nowhere near as memorable as the older games.
absolutely not classy indeed. disgusting.their complaints are either  graphical uI complaints  which I understand can be an issue but that is an easy future patch  or  too hard .last time I checked... videogames were about fun. not how many fucking pores a character has or whether you can play on ultrawide. look at how successful nintendo has been.. and they dropped the graphics competition bs ages ago. and yoshI p ff14  even stated that graphics aren t their first priority. gameplay first!many western devs dont make games for gamers. they make games for normies that dont play videogames and would rather watch cutscenes and count the facial hair strands on a woman s face.I only buy japanese korean games now. they are objectively better and also not poisoned by woke garbage.

forbidden west is a fun game. great combat  really cool world  wild sci-fI story. Imanaged to platinum it before elden ring came out. they nerfed her looks slightly but made up for it with much cooler outfits than the first game  many of which have lots of tattoos. dont let a couple salty devs deter you from a fun time. on another note  you ve inspired me to explore making youtube content. love ya mel mac!
this argument always seems pointless to me  because its not as if you can only have one side or the other.
yeah just another hack and slah platform game that is called an rpg with out being an rpg
@evacody124  kings field is the precursor to souls series  it was a first-person fromsoft series
thats because most of those people have been conditioned to thinkChristian conservative racist bigot.thats it. its why they dont view any other type of religious speech as bad.
@mike dalby  she gives you a  warning  at the end of the topic. so just  leave at that point. what s the fuss  its not like she brings it up throughout the topic article where its unavoidable. if it really bugs you that much  there s about a million other gaming channels that cover these topics without mentioning religion at all  and on a much more frequent basis. its just like this video s topic! there s too many options available to complain about one of the very few that doesnt cater 100  to you  when others do.
praying for you and your loved ones
I dunno. one month is still new tho
skyrim is mainstream. final fantasy is mainstream.  here s the issue. there are a ton of action platform  hack and slah  etc games that are being called rpgs example horizon or assassin s creed because skill tree. thing is they are not rpgs. skyrim is an rpg. so when you have  mel complain about story in and game play in in say far cry and then say games from japan are better and compare it to a tactical or turn based rpg. well she has lost the plot. people need to stop comparing rpgs be they turn based  tactical   time active  real time  or action to platform games. Imean if we are going to call any game with a skill tree an rpg then heck I guess that makes the madden games an rpg. elden ring is an action game but its not an rpg. if she were to play a real action rpg game like last epoch she would lose her mind. so would all the fans of the souls type games because there is no dodge or block. you go in with guns blazing and hope you picked the right skills as you leveled and have the best gear. if not you will die. thing is I love games like that because I know how to play them and I love gearing up character and putting points into a skill tree.though I also do like final fantasy games.
mass effect 4 was bad because the story was bad.
same with kh3 bad story
Im not playing hzd for aloy s beauty  she looks more and more like a man. she doesnt flirt with any man who s flirting with her. aloy is so much more cuter in genshin impact version.and the most used outfit in the first game was the one with the less clothing possible.far cry 4 and 5 were good  I didn t play 6. I hated assassin s creed odyssey  the leveling up with the enemies is so ridiculous  the constant changing of equipment is so stupid  I stopped playing after 4 hours.
elden ring is just simply a game that tests the limits of one s patience  skill and the will to overcome a situation so basically trial and error and the mainstream doesnt like that cause they re kids in adult body s and they dont believe in hardship or effort that rewards people who keep pushing forward after being beaten down over and over againhonestly these devs ether need to adult up or fire themselves cause we dont need them.
I wanna see these people play the original ninja gaiden and shinobImybe ninja gaiden black there are games I suck at but I never complained
not every game needs an easy mode...if they all did it would be harder for those of us who dont have the reflexes of twelve year old game addicts to decide what to not buy.btw...what  fans  are they catering to   the game isn t a sequel is it   sure lots of people bought this thing...but it wont make it long term...plenty of folks are already having buyers remorse.this game looks cool...but I dont have six hours a day to play a game with so little actual content.  re-running levels a hundred times isn t fun to me...its irritating.to each his own...but this game only did so well because of advertising...they overshot their intended audience and when the smoke clears  the company will suffer for it.
you want difficulty in a game   you should try arcade ghosts and goblins ...good luck !
to be honest after finishing dying light 2 Im burnt out on open world games. I felt dying light 2 was so boring and unfun. I didn t expect much from the story but the game play was just so damn dull imo. I finished but I for sure regret buying it.
I feel like a lot of people miss the point of Christianity. they re religious and wear God s name on their chest while citing verses such as  take delight in the Lord  and he will give you the desires of your heart.  - psalms 37 4 niv... but they re not  believers.  they act in  good ways  in exchange for a license to partake in their evil desires. they self-righteously claim to be a  good Christian person ... but  have no personal relationship with God applied to their actions... this is the one and only problem with the term  lgbtqia2s  Christian   in my opinion. if you claim to be a Christian  then you believe in God s infallible wisdom and judgment.. you believe that God doesnt make mistakes. that he is perfect in every way and is the only way to heaven... but  he may have botched their gender or sexual orientation   they  somehow in God s infinite wisdom  got the wrong plumbing or the wrong attraction I know thatsounds preachy and judgmental   homophobic   if you will  but its not meant that way. please understand that we still love y all. obviously  Im not you. I dont feel your feelings or think your thoughts  and quite frankly  thats between you and God... you may say   its not a choice. you love who you love   and I cant argue with that  though there are multiple degrees of love. my point is that Christianity is not deeds or proclamations of virtuosity that allow us to seek our own sinful desires. to believe in Christ isn t simply acknowledging that he existed and rose again. its about trust  being glued to who he is  and where he leads.  I can do good things for God all day long and still never accomplish the good that God had for me to do.giving us the desires of our hearts has absolutely nothing to do with our desires. granting the desires of our hearts is only about our relationship with and trust in him. if we truly believe in him  then our only desires should be the things that God has for us. and  as the growth of this channel testifies  God is ready to fully bless those who align our hearts to his desires for us...and wont he do it  paul writes to the corinthians   to the weal I became weak  to win the weak. I have become all things to all people so that by all possible means Imay save some.  - those of the world will always tell us how they identify. white  black  latino  female   male  Christian  athiest  republican  democrat  feminist  woke... ... ... but  the Bible states identity differently. likewise  every good tree bears good fruit  but a bad tree bears bad fruit. a good tree cannot bear bad fruit  and a bad tree can not bear good fruit. every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. thus  by their fruit  you will recognize them. - matthew 7 17 - 20 nivJesus says it best   I am who you say I am. ... ... ... what a powerful statement. if my words and deeds  the desires of my heart  dont identify me as a Christian  then  maybe Im not   blessings ... keep doin  your thing   mel... dont get hung up on loneliness because you are certainly not alone  and I truly believe that God has a plan to prove it to you.
can you please get in the kitchen and get me some of w e it is you cook with your daily pound of ground beef and or chicken   the salad I had for lunch was not enough .__.
Im kinda sad some people still think their should be an easy mode or something when they can just wait for someone to explain the lore. or get good or again play a different game
I dont care what people like. if they like a game great if they dont great...but if a critic tells me they dont like a game cause its hard Imean come on thats just weak. my only complaint about any games like this are can I save anytime I like or do I need to do some tedious 30 min quest before I can save.  I dont always have 30 mins sometimes I have less than 5 or 10 and I just wanna spend some time relaxing and progressing but nope cant save where I like.... gotta start all over. thats my only major complaint about modern games. I dont want an easy mode if the game is hard then fine I ll get better at it. but just give me the choice of when to save and I am fine.  have not looked at elden ring at all but I ll only play it if it has frequent saves or save anytime I like.
you liked assassins creed odyssey!  that game was awful  I got it because of the spartan era and it was assassins creed so thought it would be good didnt play origins but pretty surs that was good not grindy   but it was grindy as ffffuk had to mod the game to level up fast and decently have fun  if you dont mod it you d either have to pay for xp or play thousands of hours cause level 600 is when your kinda on par with enemies and abilities kinda upgraded  am at to lvl 1100 and still not everything is upgraded.ubisoft is honestly sh!t now  r6 kinda sucks with how many changes  nerfs and china friendly route their going with no dead bodies anymore  .also uno is a mess and has been for a year or 2 now  online and matchmaking breaks alot and ubisoft still hasnt fixed
keyword  yet
I totally disagree about the easy mode on game if its not intented from the developers... we have to give them the freedom to be creative and make games as they intent to make not with the influence of the investors and all the bullshit for sure... nobody wants that... the problem that fromsoftware specifically though has to put a lot more effort is to make a finished product... which means to polish the perfomance on all that platforms.... elden ring is the one worst games in terms of optimisation and perfomance... its just abysmal... 60 fps cap  stutter perfomance all over the place  not widescreen support.. probably the forgot that their game released the year 2022 not 2002... and the performance issues should have dragged down the review scores even if the content is a 10 10 which didnt happen... apparently the reviewers choose were to be critical or not which is not fair...
why are based girls always  better looking
ubisoft   nftsoft
boom
on the topic of controls accessibility   people have beaten dark souls with bananas  guitar hero controllers  etc... enjoy the equality.
modern gaming is a shitshow.elden ring just showed up took a dump everything the modern game industry stands for and said  whatchu gonna do about it  they showed everyone these companies can do better  that we should demand better  not just better graphics  but actually better games.
babies. I grew up playing nes games in the mid 80s  cry me a river about difficulty.
have you tried lost ark   that game is dialogue over load.
no its because its being called an rpg and making leveling and gearing up pointless just like dark souls does.
ninja gaiden is not an rpg. this is being called in rpg. have you ever played an rpg action or turn based both of story and both punsh  you for not leveling.
yes because making the story in an rpg game make sense from the get go is just to hard. also who cares about leveling. no just get good with pointless dodge and jump or whatever. no we dont need leveling in rpgs. I should be able to git gud and not have to level and beat every character just by knowing there move set.yeah that takes all the fun out of rpgs. good job for making me hate souls games.
what is your gfuel promo code again

you may not be catholic but check out the Bible in a year with mike schmit...its for people who dont believe and want to  people who believe but dont really know the Bible and those who read the Bible but want a new perspective...you need to learn how to read the Bible because all types of literature exist in the Bible and itshouldn t be taken literally 100  of the time...the podcast is on spotify and youtube btw.
I prefer military shooters
this is laughable  they should learn to make a better game before complaining. I got horizon forbidden west day 1 and could only play a few hours before shelving it  now elden ring has all my attention and I dont see myself ever going back to horizon. this should be a learning experience for the devs not a cry fest on twitter. if the customers love it and its breaking sales records and surpassing even cod then they must be doing something right.
is this a critique on death stranding  not cool!
haha quest design  you mean there s quests where you have to pay attention and interpret what s being said  and search for an answer to the quest  sounds like an actual quest instead of  hey go do this  here s a map marker so you can mindlessly continue the game
I cannot stand cut scenes. they work in dark souls because they re rare and feel like  a well earned break from the beating you ve been taking. I cant get into the witcher franchise. the scenes and dialogue completely ruin any momentum the gameplay stands to muster. boring
tomb raider dark souls             shut up and take my money!on a serious note.  I am also Christian but I have a different take.  I do not believe that God is in control.  one of the reasons he gave us free will is so we could have control over our own lives.  thatsaid  I believe everyone has God within them  which is the holy spirit.  and the holy spirit guides you throughout your life.. in the end though  you as an individual make your own choices... God  or the  holy spirit   isnt going to make decisions for you or act on your behalf.. you are in control of your own life and in the end you have to live with your choices.some will bring up  if God is in control  why does he allow natural disasters and diseases .  my answer is.. the devil tricked adam and eve in to letting those things in to our life.  God doesnt intervene because we as humans have to live with our choices.. even terrible ones.  thats the price of freedom.  also  God gave us the strength to push through whatever adversity we may come across.  we just have to allow him in.

@melonie mac go boom  I just got starter kit  fazeberry  mfam punch and a 10 pack of most popular flavors. I look forward to trying it  thanks for the discount!
then wrpgs and jrpgs are not for you. and stop asking for them to be removed from rpg games and call elden ring what it is a action adventure platform puzzle game.because rpgs have story   and cut scenes to tell said story because be they jrpgs or wrpgs are based on table top d d which a great dm has a great story and combat mixed together.
you cant compare the horzen games to elden ring with the horzen games are rpgs. only they are because elden ring is being called an rpg.which then I hear well they have maps with quest markers and quest logs. yeah thats quality of life improvement over the old way of having a fat note book and and map that came  with the game.but let s take all of that out of rpgs dumb them down into action adventure  platform puzzle sports games.because rpg  fans should not have a story or quality of life improvements.
