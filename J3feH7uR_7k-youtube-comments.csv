its a good thing daredevil is blind so he doesnt have to see this disaster.
a complaint for me is that jen doesnt care about saving people until a cute guy tells her she should. she spends the most of the show being self serving. she s supposed to make a complete turn around in one episode
surprised how u didnt mention how she completely destroyed the parking lot and destroyed people s cars and property for no reason  and she also tried killing him multiple time
11 58 the cops weren t arresting her because she was defending herself  the cops were arresting her because from their perspective she became a rampaging hulk like bruce or blonsky
to me its kinda strange that a stylist is well known like this cuz wouldn t bad guys go after him and thereby put heroes at risk so far the only thing I really loved bout she hulk is sketches at the credits and I hope the artist was well payed cuz those look hella good
daredevil walk of shame  look at how they massacred my boy
charlie cox is a great actor and I hope the mcu will eventually use him properly.
I laughed with you on preferring to just watch daredevil. the netflix show was amazing. charlie cox did kinda imply that this isn t the same daredevil though. how did your mom like watching the episode with you edit  melonie did you see that your she hulk video from 2 weeks ago is just under 200k views
I think I got to agree with you. when she hulk was announced I got so hyped. Ive always been a fan of the funny 4th wall breaking marvel characters like deadpool and few others. seeing what they did to she hulk think they just need to trash the show and continue with dare  devil. at least they did some things right with him coming in. or maybe here s a bright idea. fire the awful writers and bring in some better talent.
the daredevil action scene was the only good part of the episode. the ending was just absolutely ridiculous.   you wanna see the real she hulk  she has intercourse  wow. shock. horror
this was by far the best episode since ep 1. however  jen not doing her due diligence to make sure her client followed directions before going to court was sheer incompetence.
to be fair  it is kind of funny and almost refreshing that right here she is experiencing repercussions for her own actions  granted its muted because it was just because of  man bad  . it made me chuckle. at least daredevil was treated more fairly than expected.
netflix s daredevil was imo the best comic-to-screen adaptation ever made. I dont know if his own new series has been filmed yet  but if not I can only hope that disney hears the feedback from this and come to the conclusion that they really need to make all the effort to ensure its good worthy loved by fans!
was it worth all that waiting  no. was daredevil still the netflix daredevil and was fun to watch  yes  for the most part . thats all I wanted.
Im a few years shy of being 50 and sometimes I ask myself if Im not only going old but also old-fashioned. you know   back in my day...  and all. channels like yours answer it with a quite reassuring no and its all just corporate gaslighting and guilt-tripping. movie after movie  series after series  the worst thing a franchise can do is make you feel sad and disappointed for caring about it in the first place and dudes and dudettes  imho its been a very sad and disappointing ten years.
this was the first episode of she-hulk I actually liked.  the trial stuff felt real  people talked like real people  people mostly did sensible things  - I thought matt gave up his secret really easily when he could have simply said  I owed him a favor  in the courtroom.  Ive said it before - if they had started the show at episode 4  I would have thought  meh  and maybe  worth a watch on a lazy day  but because of the incredibly sour taste those first few episodes left in my mouth  my verdict is no  daredevil didn t rescue she-hulk.
the hero demolishes a parking garage because she wants to chase down a relatively normal human.
there s a lot to hate about this series a lot   I guess anything with daredevil can improve it  but this episode was watchable at least .
I was pleasantly surprised with his representation  at least she didn t belittle him like she did to bruce wasn t too happy about the walk of shame scene  seemed unnecessary to me.I was happy to see matt win the case against jen  even though it was the fault of jen s defendant.it made sense she can beat daredevil because she is a hulk but the way he lost was a bit weird seeing as they made daredevil way more acrobatic but he couldn t run away  also she literally tried to kill him twice and cost millions of dollars of destructive damage to the parking lot even though she only recently got a good job at a high paying firm Im not mad about she hulk and daredevil knocking boots as it does stay true to the comics thatshe has a wild sex drive
this whole episode with daredevil was 1000  times better then the entire show put together.
loooool
@melonie mac go boom  you thought this was something way to the black panther 2 goes into that theater yes people are praising the trailer but just watch I ll say no more I love part one more that is true and facts
okay you win the internet today
bruh
unfortunately  he can definitely feel and smell the disaster. this is just unadulterated shit.
dont worry  bro can hear it and still see shit in matrix  the one  filtermode  but he ll definitely go completely blind after the fact.
yoooooo  u got me laughing real hard
facts
but he has really good hearing...
unfortunately he can hear it
this bothered me too. the writing for this show is all over the place  and strays too far from common sense at times  in order to push specific narratives. this show had so much potential to be great.
like some real ppl that exist....
zing
unfortunately he can still hear and smell itso thats not great!

apparently dd can see cuz jen didnt even question him on how he could see where she was in the bar.
its a good thing that daredevil is blind because he could see the haters in this chat. toxic chat indeed...lol smh
@kali4nia lyfe  what haters  everyone agrees pretty unanimously
just some minor felony property destruction and attempted manslaughter ..... Im sure someone that understands the law will explain it to jen later.
good chance at least one person was sleeping in their car in thatstructure. so  probably manslaughter.
dare devil literally sarcastically scolded her twice this episode for it. do people get mad when hulk smashes shit. she hulk smash too.....
uncle toming for those youtube clicks
thank goodness she knows how to control her anger better than bruce.
to be fair  thats a typical superhero fight.
yeah  she s a villain in this piece.
@chlorr1n3  remember in age of ultron where hulk fcked an entire city  yeah maria hill said that his arrest was in the air  even though he was mind controlled. and in the first avengers film  the city was already getting destroyed by lokI so it made no difference.here she-hulk is wrecking stuff just to catch one personits absolutely mind boggling that every time a character like she hulk or wanda gets called out  people like you always gotta say  well so and so did this .
she-hulk really throwed a car at someone and missed
@chlorr1n3  hulk wasn t in control though. thats literally the storyline. he didn t have control until he became professor hulk. she supposedly has control. doesnt appear that way though. its overall just bad story writing for shehulk.
@todd taylor  2020 riots showed that type of behavior is acceptable.
@chlorr1n3  the hulk isnt trying to maintain a day job practicing law so its more believable for him to not think about the legal ramifications of his actions while fighting crime
best thing I heard all day
because unlike good old matt  we can see.if a hulkie throw a car on a person  what s that he would have been killed yes.
@chlorr1n3  she s literally jen though. she has no other guy. hulk is fucking hulk. bruce doesnt wanna do thatstuff. even then the fricken hulk has had better justification than her like trying to stop an alien invasion
@chlorr1n3  yes people in the mcu do get mad and have hated and feared the hulk for years due to his rampages which is exactly what he was trying to explain to her before she went all  begone male  on him
yup seen that part..its what a rookie would do.
@exemplar kyle  yup. she is no hero. I cant believe the writers in the showrunner tried and trick us into believing she has done the superhero thing and now she s used to it. very very pathetic..
@chlorr1n3  u keep referring hulk throughout these comments but you ve yet to respond to the people who explained why hulk was different.
daredevil even mentions that the sokovia accords were revoked and now she-hulk is giving the government an excuse to bring them back.
I laugh when remember this  I control my emotions infinitely better than you
@ivan estrada  I was very angry at that moment and also I did laugh too because she s a rookie and she still is a rookie.
yawn. this show is obviously beyond many of the subscribers here to comprehend  so they complain out of fearing what they dont understand.when you say  the show s not for us   at least you all got that right...
she is not trained in combat. the flight is a comic trope. same with the damage
@mw66vb  I do understand that and it is very sad daredevil did not need her help at all. I feel that he should have told her to go home when they were talking on the roof give her a communicator and tell her when the whole situation is done from there she continues on with her lawyer life.
when I saw that part  I thought  is she forgetting she s a lawyer
@paul smith  right. the thing about herbs thatshe live in a world of superheroes. they are like celebrities to a degree and she is not interested. even though she is in the middle of superhero life.
@mw66vb  exactly.
@cody coon  I think they could have gotten arround it by making jen insecure and self doubting so that when she gets her she hulk form  jen gets more confident and becomes a little bit of a show off  and when blonksy or titania start going on a rampage  she has to use her abilities to stop them but because she lacks experience she needs the help of other heroes namely the hulk and daredevil  bruce canteach jen about how to use her hulk powers with jen even feeling bad for her cousin as he only learned to control the hulk during the blip and viewed the hulk not as a gift but as a curse whereas jen got instant control and hasn t really had any side effects whilst matt can offer jennifer walters some advice about how to balance both lives and maybe even give her some self defense training like iron fist did in luke cage season 2 so we can explain how she beats either blonksy ortitania! addmittedly I d go with blonksy so we can get jen and bruce teaming up to kick his ass in the final fight  with jen being recruited by daredevil into a new group the defenders which would also consist of spider-man war machine iron fist moon knight echo and jessica jones  he s forming because he knows a war is coming which could be any marvel street level villain but if I had to chose I d actually have it be a gang war between luke cage from season 2 just to complete his arc and have him redeem himself and the kingpin who now has complete control over the hand!
her destroying peoples cars really annoyed me
yeah  nobody cares. if she was truly a hulkish they would be dead. also  why were they there so quick  this show is fucking stupid
@majora  yeah  what the heck do they think their flashlight guns will do to a hulk  its ridiculous. if we had anti-hulk weapons  we wouldn t need superheroes at all.
@majora  it was a set up they knew it would trigger her
so much for  I control my anger infinitely more than you
@cosmic space thing  now thatshe has hulk powers  even though she made it clear in the beginning of her being hulk thatshe didn t want it  she can use her powers to be angry whenever and to whoever because she held it in soooooo long with misogynistic men. so brave.
@varemia  those were the sonic cannons that dodc have been using. they were made specifically for fighting the hulk.
you cant honestly expect these cult members to fall for that do you
arrested for property damage. she s a fucking lawyer  she should know the laws.
she really didn t rampage  tho. she got angry just as anyone would in thatsituation.
@animegamergeek  if you get angry  thats one thing.  if you get angry and destroy stuff  then  you destroyed stuff. dude  you totally smashed that guy!  well  I was angry.  oh.  then its ok.
@ramix nudles  not saying its ok  but it wasn t a guy she smashed. she wasn t rampaging like hulk  tho.I get it that they had to do something   were  from their perspective  thinking thatshe might turn to a threat.
@cosmic space thing  its almost like the show is constantly showing jen that bruce was right about everything. too bad idiots take things completely out of perspective.
also property damage is a crime
@alvin everett  here s the thing  narratively  it only counts as a flaw as long as they acknowledge or portray it as a flaw in-universe. we ll see if this is the case in the final episode  but so far every chance jenn s had to learn  grow or improve she instead just gets validated.
but dont forget  she s completely in control of her emotions. like all women are  ddd
and wasn t it done better in the incredibles  no capes!also  does it matter when most identities are already out in the open anyway Im just amazed that the concept of bespoke clothing is somehow a novelty in this reality  especially to a career lawyer. its a stretchy  oversized suit  not voice-controlled nanotech. spider-man made his own suit ffs.
nah it was something he would do in the comics
@  im him  not remotely true
@lex ruptor  entirely true
@  im him  I dont think that dd even being charismatic and a liiiittle bit less netflix  would do that. why
@  im him  I was just thinking that
he was saying that about daredevil born again but that was inky based off the title
this is a reboot of the character  between him   kingpin there are many drastic changes  making them more comic accurate. we can assume they re multiversal versions that are very similar to the ones we saw before  not exactly the same
....why wouldnt that be the same daredevil though  I dont even know why Im asking  this is disney and they like to take what others have established and fuck it up.
@paray1  Im sick of the comic accurate bullshit. how many changes do you have to make before its basically live action comic issues  word for word  panel to panel. the  comic accurate  thing seems to me  as another grift to get people to watch their shitty shows movies.  guys  we did this to make it more comic accurate  it ll definitely be worth it! .
@chefboI  ardeeznutz   than what are you doing paying attention to the mcu  thats been their mo for well over a decade  they will adapt   follow comic storylines  for better or worse. in daredevil s case  they ve perfectly integrated him while staying true to character. they know their character   for those who also do  beyond the netflix series  this is what we want more of
@paray1  nah  they should ve kept him the way he was. it literally doesnt make sense when we ve already gotten used to how he looked already. I stand by what I said.
@chefboI  ardeeznutz   they didn t do it for kingpin  wouldn t make sense to do it for matt. idk why how a rehashed version of what we ve saw nearly 40 hours of wouldn t be a less respectable move  these are different teams behind these shows  they cant just replicate what others did before  there s no merit in that   the netflix series took liberties with the character   storylines anyway. I dont expect someone who isn t a daredevil fan to get it  but he s historically not that dark  he can fit different tones
@paray1  to me  it just looks like they re doing it to hype she hulk up  considering how its being received so far. youre probably right though.
@chefboI  ardeeznutz   excuse me   comic accurate   1.  nothing the m-she-u had done has been remotely comic accurate.  comic fans have been asking for it but denied. characters should be comic accurate. not the crap we are getting.
thank God it isn t the same daredevil
@chefboI  ardeeznutz   it is the same dd
@paray1  it isn t a reboot  vincent confirmed its the same dd. and they legit mention the avengers in his show and hulk and abomination fight and on their website itsays its the dd we know and love from recent years.
@da arkuse  it is tho marvel even confirmed it on their website itsays its the dd we know and love from recent years.
@spiderclaw74   msheu  yet there s way more men than females
@  im him  oh sure. yet most of those men are treated like useless idiots   while the women folk are the  bestest evah  as gary puts it. also kevin f. said thats what he wanted.
one thing thought the fourth wall breaking was done best in this episode as well  its been pretty lame up to this point. but found the whole but why are you still here   scene quite funny
@bne video  nah bro. show is trash in general. like post a video of you watching an episode where you laughed.  its not just lame at this point. its lame as a whole. lol
@stephen stansbury  it has been trash up to this point but did enjoy that last episode
@bne video  idk if you genuinely found  some good quality  I guess good on you. however this show looking an awful lot like how the batgirl tv show is ending up. canceled because they are too concerned about political propaganda and agendas over good story telling.
@bne video  Im pretty sure Imade my comments pretty clear on my opinions on the shows. its a no if you want a really watered down and simplified answer. xd
I agree with you they did do at least something with him but I wanted more from him  I gave this show a chance and it failed me daredevil did not save this show.
@paul smith  yeah no shit. and me and you both know they ain t gonna revisit this material. they will claim it clearly just didn t pan out due to disinterest. instead of blaming themselves and their poor choice of writers. have a feeling its  progressively  going to get worse. dx
ong
the fighting scene just looks like it was ripped out of the netflix daredevil scene where dd saves the kid from the russians while beating them in the hallway  just a shorter version.
@thanh do  nah thats just every daredevil fight from the netflix show  have him face of in a dark hallway against generic gunless losers because hes s too weak to fight of anyone with an actual weapon thats more lethal than a knife
it looked way worse. so many fast cuts and you can barely tell what was going on in the action scenes.
lol the action scene sucked  this daredevil was too acrobatic  netflix one was more realistic  also there were awful lot of cuts in the fight scene
@fenris elecit  yeah but in the netflix show was planned to have an acrobatic dd  like in the comics  but they didn t really had the budget for that.I get ur point  tho
jen doing due diligence  since when does she need to do that  she s a female main character. she doesnt  do due diligence  she smashes and complains.
it amazes me how one minute shes supposed to be an incredible lawyer but every time shes in court she doesnt even have basic prep done and has lost more cases than she has won in this show meanwhile is like oh the men I work with never had to prove themselves. like do these people een proofread what they write
@j logan  I believe the question is  do these people even read what they write proofreading is far too more complex for their brains.
its unfortunate that this show will likely see a season 2 - because that will be another entire season where a show revolving around law starring a superhero with no secret identity has a protagonist who fails to get sued for the property damage she has caused cuz that would be good writing.
@walter varner  I like this show but feel like season 2 will have different writers
@walter varner  thats what damage control was originally used for  but the mcu seems to have repurposed them into something like the atf.
kick-ass was pretty close too.
daredevil is a multifaceted character. this lighthearted approach was in keeping with some of his storylines in the comics
no it wasn t  it wasn t close to as accurate nor did it feel like daredevil. good show but not accurate whatsoever.
disney is bad s    excuse my language in front of the church but they have people have no interest in black panther too just because he was saying they love the trailer and crying thats filler they should have just changed and said you gave the suit to her I just want to see how she does and then we ll see have some blade forget it not talking not bothering
the punisher show was pretty good.
@brad miles  season 2 of the punisher was great
@big p the butcher  yeah I thought they got the spirit of frank done really well even if details were a bit off.
@brad miles  I just thought they picked such a good actor to play him and Ive been waiting to see if he s coming back but after seeing daredevil in she hulk I hope he isn t
@big p the butcher  he said he would but he d only do it if they keep punisher rated r. he s actually a fan of the comics and wants to be true to the brutal nature of the character.
@miguel s  he was funny in some storylines and those storylines tend to not be popular.  thats the thing.  he started off cracking jokes and fighting people like leapfrog and no one read the comic.  thats why they overhauled the character and made him dark and brooding.  the character works better as a dark vigilante.
not even close lmao that horrible show completely ruined the hand  not even kidddin season 2 was so bad like how tf do you mess up that bad
they made last jedI  and we still get andor and kenobi. they dont give a sh t
@aaron  exactly. frank miller s run is everyone s favorite run and it put him back on the map.
@chocochib  the show was great.  dont know what youre smoking.
@mr mxyzptlk  it doesnt need to be comic accurate. it was better and unique. its for a reason that daredevil has gained so much popularity recently and its because of netflix series. credit where credits due.
@rafdor  did you just say the netflix show is better than the comics  you cant be serious. that is so wrong its hilarious. the comics are miles better than the show.
@mr mxyzptlk  your opinion. rarely anyone about daredevil before netflix series. and now we have the disneyfied daredevil.
@rafdor  idc what anyone knew  my opinion is the standard. the comics are far superior and is why the show even exists. you can check the reception for the comic and the show. the comic is miles better. millers run and even waid run.
@mr mxyzptlk  yeah  it actually is. read some earlier dd comics and even some modern ones.
@ironbronx   .read millers run as I said. it doesnt come close bro.
@mr mxyzptlk  did youread stan lee s run  or roy thomas  or gerry conway  or even mark waid for the matter  dd always had a sarcastic sense of humor but it was just enough to fit his personality. and was even more flippant during his yellow and red appearance.
nope the trial scenes are incredibly unrealsitc
trial stuff felt real  even harvey birdman feels more realistic than this.1- jen cant bring on other cases of malpractice just because and without previously communicating it to the defense and judge.even if more people were affected by malfunctions  they are not her clients therefore are not part of the prosecution  if she wanted them to be so  then she should have filed a class action lawsuit.2- she states that due to the nature of the case  there is no inherent right to privacy  which is a blatant lie.  check article 8 of the human rights bill 23- she clearly had a conflict of interest  as she is the defendant s client.4- jen does a terrible job at research by not investigating his client s actions  using jet fuel therefore breaching the use instructions of the suit 5- at the end of the trial  the client asks  am I going to jail   and she answers  no  but I d like you to ... man thats real professional on her part...6- she confirms her conflict of interest by apologizing to the defendant right on the court room and begging to still be his client.either she is a very bad lawyer  or she is very poorly written  you choose.
@andres lozano  so its as poorly written as the trials in daredevil  damn you would think they d learn from that but I guess not.
@andres lozano  when you the compare the trial scenes in this show which has  at law  in its name to any of the trial scenes in the netflix daredevil series you d realise matt would ve thrown up and dropped dead by how awful of a lawyer she-hulk is.
@chocochib  I agree that netflix s daredevil had some bad trial scenes...but this trial scene makes those scenes look like a real trial by comparison.
please dont ever try to give legal advice  or become anything affiliated with law if you think the court scene was  sensible  or talked acted like real people... also feel bad for saying that  like.. really feel bad. this doesnt resemble how anything would go down in court  hell the lawyer would have asked the questions about instructions for mechanical devices before accepting the case! it would never have made it to court  and if an attorney tried via deceitful and greedy actions  they could face disciplinary hearings for this if ordered by the judge for wasting the court s time. also there would be no reason to call for other clients of the defendant  a lawyer would know this.. hell a first year paralegal would know this. also the judge woulda hit the defendant with a contempt of court with the guys first remark  of course Im not representing myself  Im not stupid ... that is never something anyone of dignity would say to a judge  also this kind of litigation wouldn t happen so fast  and her talking to the would be defendant other than to hand him a court summons  which is usually done via third party  even for small time lawyers  which her lawfirm is not ... any other contact would only damage her case.
@andres lozano  3 is false... it would only be a conflict of interest if she  or other member of her lawfirm  were representing the defendant in a similar case  or on retainer .
@notusingmyname  it was terrible  Im not a lawyer nor do I live in the united states so Im not fully familiarized with us procedures and yet even I could tell this was crappy at best....
hulk.....
hey! that car was misogynistic and deserved to be thrown obviously. and obviously parking garages are sexist and should be destroyed
@chlorr1n3  are you comparing a person who s in control of what she does  to a being that is fueled by anger keep blame shifting my guy.
entertaining atleast
@andres lozano  both. but I was referring to the legal stuff in the context of the show so far.
thats probably because it wasn t a she-hulk show with daredevil as a guest star. it was a daredevil show with she-hulk as a guest star.
yeah but 10   shit is... still shit. 10   is 1000
@notusingmyname  hahaha right! no matter how much you polish a turd...its still a turd! lol
@williamwizer  right  everything was great...until they made daredevil do the walk of shame with no shoes on....
@neededthisdave  a thing that I dont understand  why didn t he put his shoes on it cant take more than five minutes.
from what Im gathering from this video. daredevil isn t worth suffering through the show. the fact he s somehow inferior to she hulk in areas is just ridiculous considering this is meant to be her origin story  meaning she should be making a lot of mistakes like any nooby hero would and he would ve made at least an interesting mentor since he s got experience  and the fact they are both lawyers which would ve been cool if this was written right.
what I didn t like is that the  love  between them felt so forced  they were moving too fast  I could see them getting together in the future after a few movies or shows  but the romance just wasn t developed enough yet.
8 episodes in and finally something happens. progression! oh sorry there s only one episode left
no it was not.
charlie cox such a pro  that he went with the funny take of the daredevil  and even so  he was owning all the scenes that he was in!
as someone who has fallen out of love with this show gradually I will say  this episode made me smile. just seeing charlie do his thing was great  I personally enjoyed seeing this lighter side of the character  and also leapfrog who has always been this bumbling d-list villain in the comics. I enjoyed him for how lame he was lol
clearly her grunts are telepathic. there s no end to she-hulk s powers.
I got two questions. 1. what s the walk of shame  2. wouldn t his feet be sensitive to the ground because of his powers
if the whole point of the show is to showcase that men are better writer than women then they have done an almost perfect job. first half  a marvel sitcom  with more humour than the first seven episodes combined  second half super hero show. we even get dialog that have anything to do with the situations and actions of the characters. we also finally get a jen that is starting to mature  at an old age  and realise thatshe needed help  realise thatshe got help and thank daredevil for the help she got  more character development in one sentence than the whole run so far. the potential for sitcom based marvel shows is definately there  if they chose to hire writers who are writers and not feminist activists. go cody! it was really silly to have him leave with his boots in his hand like a hung over chick though  the credits only mentioned cody but on imdb it also listed dana so this might be her contribution .
I thought the daredevil scenes were alright  though the main issue I have with the like hallway area is itseemed clear what they were going for was to sort of mimick the hallway or stairway scenes from the netflix daredevil  which would have been cool if they didn t use cuts for every single thing  created a very real contrast between the two rather than a call back.
that wasn t a redemption  that was definitely a damnation
God I love this woman!
with all that collateral damage from she hulk  the season finals gonna be a seinfeld.
Im late but now watching. did your mom enjoy she hulk or did your mom punish you. granted I watch it and daredevil was the best part. but there was some cringe parts. I do hate the cg with this show. great video. btw you look beautiful melonie. talk to you later. stay cool. until next time.
for once the lawyer seen in this episode was actually good it was actually good I cant believe it I wonder which writer on the team actually watched a lawyer scene and realized this is the scene of a lawyer that we re supposed to do.
its almost like when they license the characters  those creators end up having more respect and love for the characters than disney. ie netflix daredevil. man thatshow was litso nicely.
maybe daredevil could ve held his own against her a little more for a while. but even with ninja skills and super senses he s still just a regular guy and she s a hulk with the strength to level an entire city. how could he have beaten her in a fight.
thing is daredevils plan was working  he was taking them out fairly silently  meaning the 20 other goons weren t alerted only the 10 which was his plan  she  destroys everyone else s property in the process take out the next 5 and  alerting everyone which wasn t needed. as for near the end um she did a load of public destruction in a rage destroying tv s the ceiling  and walls no wonder she got arrested and people are like this is so realistic man if people did such destruction sure they d get arrested.
honestly  it made me want to rewatch the daredevil series and the defenders. I didn t necessarily mind jen being able to take him down with that clap - he s pretty much a normal man  other than his enhanced senses  so it would make sense for that move on her part to be able to take him down. Im honestly surprised he was at all coherent afterwards  that would have been incredibly painful with his super hearing  wolverine has even acknowledged in the comics that matt s enhanced senses are more acute than his own . I didn t mind terribly the dynamic with their fighting together or against each other. matt is awesome  but he s also up against a hulk. she gets her hands on him  hits him with a car  uses her super-clap  or otherwise employs her strength  there s not terribly much he can do about it. I saw her backing him up in the hallway scene as actually working as well. matt already took down a bunch of guys. he has been known to fight to the point of collapse and pretty significant injury. so when the bad guys  back-up came  it didn t bother me when jen showed up. I figured she got bored of waiting. its honestly something I can see jessica jones  who I like a lot better  doing. I think waiting is hard when youre a powerhouse who usually solves problems by plowing through them. in light of the entire show  I can see how jen s timely entrance into the fight could be annoying  but  taken alone  it worked pretty well imho. I enjoyed the way the characters were utilized in the parts of the fights I saw online. still no desire to see the entire episode  though. a good fight or two wont save the episode from bad writers with an agenda. and  on a side-note   matt s yellow costume reeeeally didn t translate well to live action  it ended up looking silly in comparison to the all-red one we re used to from the show. but  yeah  from what I saw  they didn t ruin matt s character like I thought they would. I was afraid they would make him a weak shadow of himself and they didn t. that felt a bit like a win.
its one thing to not be able to write compelling court room scenes  its another thing to not understand what lawyers do at all
cant have a man mentor our hero tho of course!! cuz our hero is perfect already!!! exclamation
actually they finally made her inferior to somebody else  he whooped her ass in a court of law and even though the writers have no idea how to write a courtroom scene  by their own admission   it was amazing to see
in terms of overall strength he would lose. he s obviously not as strong as she is. she also doesnt have any fighting skills  its literally just she-hulk smash!daredevil has fighting skills and knowing she s super strong  he has to take advantage of his martial prowess to get around his lack of strength compared to her.
@david conway jr.  I think everyone can agree she d win in raw strength alone. we see this with bruce as well. but unlike bruce  we dont see much of that nooby super hero stuff with she hulk. she by default outclassed bruce in the training stuff as if somehow women are scientifically physically stronger than men. they re genetically more robust  not physically.imagine if she was actually unique by being weaker than bruce but when agility comes in  she d outclass him. in the comics she makes up her lack of hulk strength with martial arts  something daredevil could ve mentored her in . also  she s unique in thatshe can manipulate gamma radiation. she can gain strength by absorbing gamma radiation from the environment. imagine her learning these types of abilities. she s no miles morales of hulk where she s got similar traits but totally unique stuff which is super disappointing.
@the batman  at least there s that  but not something I see as nooby superhero stuff.
@ezav47  yeah  because clearly its just a genetic thing.
what are you talking about  he did mentor her  and was also much better at fighting than her. he was much more capable in this than in the netflix show. live in reality.
lmfao homie just shit out a compelling storyboard idea
it was written eight  and she did. go watch it.
@mw66vb  Im not gonna give my time to it based on a comment when I can use it elsewhere where I know it ll be well spent. there are other ways to know.
always needed to be a longer show in my opinion too.
@chlorr1n3  with the amount of fillers and pointless scenes I dont think the writers of she-hulk are capable of writing a longer show or would it improve it in anyway shape or form
well what did you accept   this show relies heavily on cameos as per jessica gao the head writer who admitted to this in an interview. its like the writers already admitted defeat  they cant write a compelling  well written story hence the need for  cameos  to carry the show this shows is like junk food -all hype without any substance.
it was a one night stand. they didn t get married.
agreed. nuff said lol
lol true
great and amazing comment. straight up short and not sweet.
it wasn t even a positive
I will be honest I didn t watch much disney mcu. based on what I have seen both men and women are portrayed in very stereotypical ways. disney new age macho princess and dumb male screw balls.  just why its boring and cruel.
@fullmetal b  not really from what Im hearing. when I say mentor  Im thinking iron man and spider-man type of relationship where there s true mentorship minus the father son chemistry for obvious reasons. there is no evidence of her being mentored by a seasoned hero. the closest thing here is ofc daredevil but its very half hearted at best and not long before the end of the season. this show should ve been like hawkeye where all this stuff happens in the beginning and improves as the show goes. the way it is now just doesnt work.
@thegravityshifter   from what im hearing  dismissed.
@fullmetal b  thats fine if you wanna dismiss it. I know what I know and thats good enough for me. the fact melonie liked what I put tells me what I said is accurate enough.
@thegravityshifter  it means it couldn t be more inaccurate.
@fullmetal b  I ll agree to disagree then.
he s only human. she s super human. of course she s going to be stronger and faster than him.......
@fernando martinez  not talking raw strength or raw speed. I specifically said martial arts. anyone who is great at martial arts can win against someone clearly stronger than them.in the comics she makes up for her lack of hulk strength  compared to bruce s  with martial arts. so not only would it have been better  but more comic accurate.
@thegravityshifter  ok yeah but he ran off to chase after leapfrog not realizing she had the ability to clap her hands and knock his senses off by a lot. I see a lot of people complain that his acrobatics make him look too strong and too superhuman then they also complain he didn t beat a literal hulk.
@fernando martinez  thats not an indication that he s inferior though. it just shows he s not aware of her abilities and itshows because he got hit with it.
@thegravityshifter  exactly.
@fernando martinez  doesnt support what you initially said so idk why youre saying that. different abilities doesnt equal stronger and faster than daredevil.
@thegravityshifter  she hulk can run 40mph easily so she is in fact faster than him on foot. even luke cage can only run 30mph. usaine bolt can run 24mph. I doubt daredevil cantear a parking lot apart so she is in fact stronger than him. this doesnt make him inferrior but he was clearly not trying to fight and was more interested in chasing down leapfrog. my first point was that its weird when I see other people complain he s too strong then complain he couldn t put up a better fight against she-hulk.
@fernando martinez  my point is how she hulk isn t having a more realistic origin story. thats the original point of my main comment. hulk and daredevil would ve made great mentors but it didn t really happen.
1. having people see you leave somewhere post coitus  looking a hot mess. usually after a long night of drinking.2. good observation! I remember that dialogue he had with stick about needing silk sheets in order to sleep.    homeboy was prob3feeling pretty beat up after some she-hulk snu snu. haha.
the walk of shame is a phrase meaning a woman walking home after obviously getting porked the night before since she is in a club dress early in the daylight and carrying her high heels from the night before.  this is meaant to be funny in the show because daredevil is the one doing the walk  though why hes carrying his boots siunce the reason the women carry their shoes is the impracticality of wearing them for long periods  I dont know.  the barefoot on grass thing im pretty certain he can walk about barefoot if he wants he alone knows the limits of his powers and whats comfortable. maybe thats why hes walking on grass not the sidewalk.
its also just dumb how hed be in his dd outfit in broad damn daylight just cruising around as it would be insanely easy for people to figure out his identity based on knowing jen lives close by etc etc
@j logan  not really. he came to her place with his suit on. there s no reason for people to assume he s matt murdock
I know you do  my son
we should be so lucky. in fact  every one of these shows should end with them getting arrested.
@Christopher trevino  yah  at first shield covered them  maybe nato  heck even tony can cover the damages.
if he knew more about fighting her its possible to use her own strength against her.
@fernando martinez  okay true maybe with some prep time he could beat her in a rematch
plus alot of tiems you want to be subtle bc if you come crashing in through the roof like she does it gives your target time to run  prepare  or destroy evidence etc plus you would obviously be tampering with or destroying evidence yourself by accident.
I truly respect your opinions on all your synopsis...also I happen to agree and am comforted I am not alone in my perceptions.
another point  in this episode she loses her case again  she legit loses more than she wins in this show  bc she didnt do basic prep work  its played for laughs bc  ha ha man client so dumb  but think about this  all we have heard is shes supposed to be an incredible lawyer and that the men she works with  never had to prove themselves  but every time shes had to be a lawyer she sucks at itso did the writers even notice their own contradictions
this was the first good decent episode of she-hulk
Im not big into the original comics  so I dont know how close a fight between she-hulk and daredevil would be. Ive watched all the seasons of daredevil  so Im glad they didn t just crap on murdock altogether cause they did a great job with thatshow.
its so refreshing to find a channel like yours where you as a woman actually see and understands how pandering and awful all this woke shit is for gays women people of color. they act like their are all for them but they constantly bash and put them down. you rock Im subbing
I appreciate you for this breakdown! saved me from wasting my time haha ... daredevil is amazing!
the fights were good kinda in his show they were actually choreographed rather than edit to edit like here and more brutal and they made him way too jokey for my liking however he also made this episode bearable to watch
I love the whole  Im infinitely better at controlling my anger than you  bruce   just for her to lose her temper and destroy the screen at the end of the ep.
I first heard about you through the quartering about a year ago  but Im just now actually watching your videos. love your content.  m
daredevil was great. best episode in the whole season. definitely got my hyped for daredevil born again. whenever he wasn t on screen I was thinking  when is daredevil at
the thing that really annoys me is how she was nominated for best lawyer when she didnt even ask if the frog guy misused the suit in any way that he shouldn t have before accepting his case!
I did love charlie cox back as daredevil but instead of wanting to keep watching she hulk I thought  man I wanna rewatch daredevil on netflix
kinda want to rewatch the daredevil show now just to experience when they were actually able to make somewhat good tv shows
I liked how they made daredevil as acrobatic as he is in the comics tbh and I thought it was a pretty good episode. daredevil carried
Im glad that they didn t ruin daredevil. they showed his true power and intelligence and didn t make him look like a fool  and even let him outsmart jennifer
she fall into other man after what happened actually pretty realistic. Ive known some woman that really despaired to get into relationship like that. my friend  after a depressing relationship that make her cry a lot  in just few weeks she enter new relationship with other man that actually pretty much same toxic kind of man that really controling and want his woman being what he want. after that 2nd relationship  she back in touch with her ex  the first guy and kind of want to back again with him. and around that time  she go out with a man that already had a girlfriend. so its really realistic actually  sometimes woman being that kind of dumb
I didn t even watch the first 7 episodes  Ive just been waiting for dd . even in the episode he s in I have my complaints  the enemy was terrible for one. heres hoping for born again to be good!
it didn t redeemed the show but did redeemed the episode it was entertaining
in defense of her winning  that is kind of a logical way of stopping him.I had a slight flashback to the boys in s2 I believe ep1 . when homelander uhhh incapacitated the daredevil knock off
he was great as always. unlike jen  he s charming  and actually funny. not to mention we got some actual action. but it isnt enough to save the quality of the show unfortunately
honestly I feel thatscene was cool because it can leads to jen losing control and hulk having the full control
a bucket of cement could outsmart the green tampon
and all he had to do was point out the obvious  which jen should have deduced before taking it to trial. the suit malfunctioned  oh  what fuel were you using. that exceeds 900 degrees  cool  youre at fault.  but apparently the lawyer of the year isn t smart enough to think about the cause of the defect and immediately wants to subpoena anonymous superheroes to ask them whether their costumes are working correctly.
matt s body count is twice as high as jen in comics.
@fernando martinez  I wasn t talking about that  but since you mentioned it  at least matt tried to take his time first lolmatt   maybe next time  I could take you to dinner .jen    let s skip all of that..
@shaun a.a  sure but he is known for being a hit it and quit it kind of guy in every version of himself. sure its better to take a woman out to dinner first but if all you have in mind is a one night stand afterward its still scummy regardless of if she s into it or not. I suppose thats just the catholic in me.
@fernando martinez  I feel what youre saying  but then again  its all about a person s lifestyle  if he didn t have a double life  then maybe he d have more time on his hands to commit to something. I also blame it on elektra since she had a toxic influence on him that definitely made him rethink committing to someone.
why wouldn t she win  would we expect bruce to lose to captain america and or hawkeye
@fernando martinez  in the video itsounded like she was disappointed that dd lost  at least to me. she said something along the lines of  and then she-hulk beats him because of of course she does   if I recall right  I could be wrong. Im not in a position to rewatch it rn Im about to party
@txnuttsup  no that is what she sounded like and someone else in the comment section asked how he would win to begin with and she agreed it was a fair point. I see this as the damage woke shows have done to us. they make us see terrible writing and females doing well as woke in all cases rather than just the select ones that make no sense. melonie s friend the quartering made a video talking about how insanely woke halo was and I disagreed heavily. it was clear jeremy didn t see the episode nor care enough to know that eveey first episode of a series on paramount is free to see. I then went into the comment section and asked numerous people what was woke ahout it and sure they mentioned race swapping but I figured they didn t even mention race once in the series so does it really count. after a while people actually started to agree that the show itself wasn t all that woke just full of terrible writing. 1 guy actually said keyes being black is why he s such a dishonorable person in the show as the white keyes would never agree to execute a little girl. ithen corrected him saying that keyes actually kidnapped 75 kids without caring much and alsp refused to speak out against an officer that killed multiple classmates of his on the moon to save his career. he didn t respond after that.
@fernando martinez  you lost me fernando. but it be how it be
so glad that I found your channel  melonie. youre really getting at the heart of these pandering types of shows without becoming a toxic basher yourself. Ive seen people go to the other extreme with criticizing things  so I really appreciate your perspective.I especially appreciated you addressing the sex scene issue  not just in this show  but in so many shows and movies. glad Im not the only one who feels that way. its like  are people super into watching or something  this is stuff people always do privately  and yet we re there in the room with them  is everyone into voyeurism   let alone the awkwardness of watching those kinds of scenes with a family member  especially - heaven forbid - parents.
this feels like itshould have been episode three or four as an incident that gets the show going. not the second to last episode.
ya know  that makes sense that dd would lose in her show. that happens in print. the hero whose title it is generally wins the altercation. or at least gets the upperhand until they are split up somehow. too bad that it had to happen to dd.
the irony is  they may actually do well with the daredevil series  if everyone just ignores this show s existence. edit may be wishful thinking though...
thanks for reviewing  it alleviates my curiosity and solidifies why it wont get my viewership.  its sad though. I really want a couple shows to watch  but Im either being bashed for being a man  guilted for being born white  or slammed for being straight.  I literally have to go into every new show with the expectation that Im about to be ridiculed. then I am  and the tv goes off.
tbh I was expecting worse. they still made him into just another quip machine  but it could ve been much worse than what it was.
the problem with modern shows is that the protagonist must never be wrong  never make any mistakes  and thus their growth cannot be from something they learned by fixing the mistake they made  but rather by having someone else validate them.pinocchio 2022 is a good example of this - pinocchio does everything right  but things outside of his control keep dragging him down the bad side  so when he finally gets at the end of his journey... he s the exact same character he was at the beginning of the movie!same thing here - she hulk cant learn anything from the more experienced lawyer and hero  she has to be the one on the right that nobody listens to until she s proven to have been right all along. daredevil was the perfect character to call her out on her bullshit and teach her the weight of the responsibility that comes with her powers and her career  how lives can be ruined if they dont take care of their clients and victims they rescue  how a single mistake can be detrimental to innocent people  but thatsomeone has to take the risk and do the things they do  otherwise suffering is innevitable.but nope  perfect mary sue cant make mistakes  learn anything or even get any close to believing she might have done something she shouldn t have  its everyone else who s on the wrong  and its only a matter of time until they learn that! the hard way!
the only thing daredevil s association with the she-hulk show does for me is make me concerned about the future of daredevil s show.
Im sure the writers thought matt didn t win so much as jen s client lost the case for her. but her client lost because she was totally inept at checking out his case first -- I dont think the writers understood how incompetent they ve made her throughout the season.
jen may control her anger  infinitely  better than bruce  so much for that  eh   but bruce is infinitely better at being intimidating. she-hulk s outburst was a tantrum. the equivalent of 2012 hulk getting angry at taking the stairs in endgame.damage control didn t arrest her because she was liable to cause serious injury and death. they came to put her on the naughty stair to think about what she d done.
Im pretty sure this episode is the highest rated episode period lol! I didn t mind ketchup and mustard daredevil suit you gotta do something different to bring really bring him in the mcu. and then after the daredevil stuff it all went down and thats sad
another melonie mac video! Im here for it
daredevil wasnt enough to redeem she hulk but im happy with the daredevil we got
you cantell when folks only know dd from the netflix series compared to those who actually read the comics and understand the layers of his character.
daredevil wears tactical boots suitable for street brawling. the  barefoot  carrying his heels walk of shame  makes zero sense except as an emasculating tool. daredevil was the best of the mcu  and vincent d onofrio s wilson fisk was the mcu s greatest villain  beating out even freakin  thanos. disney destroyed both.  endgamewastheend
lmao melonie is hilarious. 1m soon
absolutely refreshing commentary that assures me perhaps I haven t gone insane. what can we expect next
the frog guy was in the comics. I think the punisher killed him off
gets exposed in public  flips out and breaks things in an immediate reaction  says she s  infinitely better at controlling her emotions  than bruce.
when I heard about the she hulk show I was kinda hoping thatshe would be added to the defenders to build out their team a bit more. instead they turned her into an insufferable character and watered down daredevil.
@fernando martinez  what does that have to do with what I said
@giga bowser  just throwing it out there.
@fernando martinez  okay
agreed.  I didn t like the mustard green highlights on his outfit though.  seems very out of character and likely just done to go along with the gamma green color scheme.  and the  walk of shame  bit was just cringe.  he basically a ninja and has a secret identity.  he wouldn t go home like that.
@tutu adefolalu  I hate that yellow and red outfit  from the comics too. yeah this show is so different from the daredevil show so it is so off seeing matt do that in costume. but for guys its not a walk of shame  its the stride of pride
@tutu adefolalu  I can kind of see the walk of shame moment as perfectly fitting for she-hulk  though.  the comic itself was pretty whacky.  so  it fits.  you kind of have to look at it like a what if  episode.
he s more powerful and faster then his older show counterparts
you guys thats his first suit from the comics y all dont read the Goddamn comics. and even I dont like the yellow suit. as I digress  the red suit will always be superior.
@Christian smith  so what was the point of your comment
@Christian smith  we know that  its still fugly.
isn t that the way captain marvel is too  I wouldn t know because I didn t care enough to actually watch it  but thats the gist Ive seen and heard from countless people.
@twilightwolf032   the problem with modern shows is that the protaganist must never be wrong .arcane  - literally a show revolving around how the actions of the main protaganist cause her sister to become a psycho who never dealt with her trauma properly  all while teaming up with silco as a means for revenge
glad they saw this in the mcu peter parker and changed it at the last second saving the character as a whole. they should take the born again story and apply that to every woke character just to unfuck themselves for a while.
he s the exact same character he was at the beginning of the movie! sounds like other characters of recent years..rey from star warskenobI   vader in kenobI series
@justin stewart  and thats why arcane is heavily praised both by lol players and those who never played the game - its just that good!
@tyler durden  not only captain marvel  but also mulan  the new he-man by local crybaby kevin smith  etc.Im sure you can find a crapton of examples in the last 5 years if you bother to do a little research.
she s been wrong this entire season....
@mr. j  the narrative doesnt perceive her as being wrong. its everyone else who is.
really shows the incompetency of the writers huh
I was dissapointed when she hulk interupted that hallway fight I was like alright show me something then boom nothing and I get it as to why they did it but its just disappointing for me
@murch  agreed. I was pumped to watch that beat down. then thunder thighs drops in and wrecks it.
@murch  duude same that was so annoying. hopefully we get another one in his show
or  stay with me  a joke.  emasculating tool  how pathetic can one person be
didnt know men walking bare foot means that they are no longer a man. does that mean I should wear shows wherever I go because if not then Im not a masculine man
ya  disney destroyed the mcu when they bought it back in 2009.
that moment would be just fine if she was seen actually controlling her emotions throughout the time she s had the powers  but she s been exactly the same way from day 1  she s nearly killed people by not caring about her surroundings or gets upset so fast and intentionally goes beating people cuz she s petty
@strange faced  yep. the show writers cant even keep one character attribute consistent.
I loved daredevil in this show and thats the only reason I started watching it you nailed it
8 25 the true villain of she-hulk  ...sloot shaming
yes he definitely saved the show.
daredevil deserve to be in a movie not a tv show but the thing is certain people have problem with each other during the civil war for real and thats this result
you know whats real funny  this is the best daredevil will be. bc u know damn well when his show comes out  it ll just be about echo.
he made the episode watchable....thats about it.
you know  there was absolutely no way she could have known who was under her when she broke through the ceiling  for all we know  she could have smashed through and killed daredevil   because those dudes  totally dead.
funny how they picked the legally blind superhero for she hulk to have chemistry with
its almost like there were two different writing teams passing the baton for this episode.
nothing can redeem she-hulk
tbh  this episode was much better than the previous episodes
he s appearance was awesome tho
Im so glad thatshe pointed out that almost every male in the show is stupid or mean.
this felt like seeing Christian bale s dark knight in justice league 2017 cut.  something s definitely bleeding.
thank God there s only one episode left  - every you tuber I have watched reviewing this show.
thank God there s only one more episode ok just wait until season 2
to be fair to the hookup scenario  in the comics  they re both rather hound-doggy  and that has been true about matt in his show to some-degree  too. assuming he s attracted to jen  though I cant see why... neither can he  ba-dump-tish!  this is reasonably in character for him. walking back to wherever in broad daylight after  not really  but its a comedy. mocking him afterward... not in canonical-jen s character  but this jennifer is basically a super-villain so sure why not.  not saying the casual hookup was morally right  of course. only that it was technically in character.
I couldn t stop laughing with her grunting
I dont like this series  only watched a couple of episodes  this episode included . I hated the walk of shame  but I actually kind of liked that they let matt try to convince jen to adopt the  live two lives  approach that he uses. she outright rejected bruce  but seems she was sort of willing to listen to matt.I appreciate how you were fair with the episode and gave it props where it was due and torched it where it failed!
I still havnt watched it among other marvel shows like moon knight or even the black widow movie. eventually I will while painting some minis but glad to see daredevil back.
with the failure of this show  ring of power  bros and other woke pieces I truly hope hollywood wake up soon and start to move the needle back.
honestly  the recap part of the episode really sums up the mentality.  if youre not going to be a superhero  what are you going to do   then montage of twerking and sleeping around because thats a much better choice.
well if you want to see more daredevil you could just watch his show and review that. it is honestly one of the best thing marvel has ever made  but be careful of season 2
haven t seen it yet but heard this is dd light because disney...the clips Ive seen of him though look better than the entire she hulk series so far lol
so youre saying the female lawyer of the year  didn t think to ask her client anything in particular about his jetpack boots.......like how they were powered and if there was anything he may have done to affect their performance. after what they did to all of the other characters in this show  I really didn t expect much from daredevil.is shehulk gonna represent herself when the lawsuits start coming from destroying part of that parking tower and the cars beneath I guess since this is a comedy  there s no way anyone could have been killed after hulk smashing the top of a parking tower in the middle of the city.
maybe Imissed it but did mel know about doomcock being the villian on this episode
I was more surprised the dude could even find jet fuel for his suit given how they portray him on screen.
Imiss the daredevil netflix series
9 38 so much for  I control my anger infinitely more than you
I enjoyed how quick and acrobatic they made him during the acton scenes and I like that he was clearly a better lawyer but aside from that this was disappointment made manifest
I dont know what you call that move when you were imitating the caricature of the gay guy  but I wish you d find a way to incorporate that in every one of your videos henceforth. that was awesome.
melonie  these people stopped living in the real world a long time ago. I believe they resent it and cant stand it. and like in a video game  they are customizing their avatar and lying is a small thing to overlook to create their own reality where they can larp. why  because they want everything  but cant do anything...
I agree ! I also found itso repulsive not only when she hooked up with daredevil like that  walk of shame  right after she was so sad about getting ghosted the week before  but the part when her friend was like you hooked up with that devil guy ohh girl you the devil.... smh just absolute mockery of the shehulk character and marvel comics. sadly too daredevil was incredibly kool for the entire 2 minutes they let him be kool in the episode.... just said how over the top the writers or whoever is to blame for this trash show.
thank you for keepin it great.. daredvil walk oh shame wasn t necessary as in they could have see him but he didn t know ppl around him   I have a bot on this
the walk of shame was the only thing that made me laugh. seeing badass daredevil sauntering by without shoes is a funny look
daredevil made this episode decent.
it would be cool if we got the she-hulk defending captain america while daredevil prosecutes him or she hulk going to latevaria to save dr. doom s son but we got this disaster instead
I just noticed dd s  undermask  changed colors mid scene. itstarted out red  then ended up yellow..
yes marvel more of daredevil please! we like him! bring back karen and foggy too!
I dont know about leap-frog but his son  frog-man  is a joke character. I can remember an issue of some spider-man comic where frog-man  spider-kid  an overweight teen who idolized dr. octopus and built his own mechanical arms before becoming a spider-man fan and modifying them into spider legs   and toad  from the x-men  were all competing over who should be spider-man s sidekick and in the process getting themselves into absurd situations spider-man then had to rescue them from.
well  at the very least  daredevil reminded us a time when shows were good.
wouldn t doubt it being a lite version given how bruce was handled who has been there since the beginning.
they just announced this is the same daredevil from the show apparently
@sockmonkey gaming yes  but I read that disney wasn t going to have him be as dark as the netflix series because of disney and this show is more goofier  lighthearted unfortunately.
@mkf30  yea true sadly. I just his jokes are still as good as they were in daredevil because he s still a goofball.
@sockmonkey gaming  true  Imean with the violence aspect but I get it because its disney and she-hulk vs netflix which was darker. would be funny if the episodes with dd get higher ratings then once he leaves worse again lol
@fernando martinez  its just how they made it look in the episode that was distasteful to me.
@shadowless pok man dimes  eh. distasteful in comics too. that just means bith need improvement.
I saw it as him walking home satisfied from his one night stand. matt s body count is twice as high as jen in comics. he has countless one night stands and makes even iron man look like a virgin by comparison.
vfx artist barely finishes she-hulk s face do you think they have time to care about his  undermask
definately the best episode
I legit groaned out loud at the walk of shame thing bc no man ever does the walk of shame  no man would ever walk barefoot carrying his shoes like some sorority girl walking home from the frat house  and matt has never been so stupid to walk around in broad daylight in his vigilante attire especially knowing that his steps can easily be retraced back to jens home and a smart person can put 2 and 2 together to figure out matt murdock is daredevil with just those pieces of info.
daredevil was there biggest marvel show! to see him done like that is just sad
I actually quite liked this episode. the only one Ive liked so far mind.I think anyone expecting daredevil to be the dark and brooding guy we got over on netflix is naive. he was obviously going to be a bit watered down from that because disney.but otherwise I think he was represented well and fairly familiar to how I remembered him. you also have to consider that he is not only now over at disney but here in whats meant to be a light comedy show.I imagine in his own show he might be a little edgier again... maybe.
this show was not meant for us average people it was written for all those people out there suffering from bpd and narcissism to validate their life perspectives.
in this episode s defense  the  walk of shame  was the first and only time this show made me laugh
she-hulk only won one case in her show.
@6 09 disparu has been sliiiightly more explicit on this running thing with jen  has he offered to buy her half a bag of chips       but yeah she s fairly quick.
the show is bad but charlie cox has saved my life with his performance the writing for daredevil hit the mark besides maybe a few goofy lines but I dont think thats a bad thing matt murdock is a very 2 sided character  he s not always going to be dark and brooding like he was in season 3. character progression is not a bad thing. let s not forget he was ready to die in season 3 he was at his lowest of lows  he doesnt always need to be at this point.
I like this show because itshows how she-hulk goes from being a polite and unassuming country girl from red cloud  kansas to a promising and principled practitioner of law in albuquerque  all to have her bright and noble future squandered by her lurid love affair with criminal attorney matt  daredevil  murdock. bravo  jessica!! 6 out of 5.    r.g.
my biggest complaint all along has been how they portray all the other superhero villain characters. I loved the happy matt not being the dark sad netflix matt who was always looking for something to blame himself for. and once again  she hulk has always been a character with a huge bedroom bodycount  so Im not mad about that. now the cg. they dont have a budget p episode. they have a budget for the whole series so they have to split the cg budget between all the episodes
if she-hulk isn t disbarred  there is no legitimacy to the series whatsoever.  she should immediately be recusing herself from the case.  if we find out in season two thatshe lost her license and took up hooking to make ends meet and to keep up with her heroine addiction  I ll watch.
she hulk math - jenn sleeps with 0.375 dudes per episode. she is batting better then most all-star baseball players.- jenn sleeps with a dude every 66 minutes. 3 times 8 episodes approx 25 min per episode.- the only man who wanted to sleep with jenn was blind.  one wanted to set her up and the other only wanted she-hulk .
go someone as powerful as she-hulk  she does a metric crap ton of hand wringing and  oh woe is me! Im so lonely and miserable and need men! these writers need help from anime writers. they can write strong  female characters  with amazing personalities! bulma  chi-chI  android 18  casca  pretty much every woman in my hero academia.
the frog man character is pretty comic accurate.  he s a joke character thatshows up every now and then.
literally waited all day for this
I was also wondering why the  goons  were using crossbows.from a criminal perspective  a crossbow is absolutely useless.
netflix daredevil  the punisher and the defenders to see good daredevil. believe they are all on disney  now. hallway fight!
I liked daredevil in this one. if youre going to compare him to the frank miller comics or the series  you will be disappointed but if you know daredevil from the comics  this was pretty good!
well she-hulk is supposed to be super sexual and the strange part to it all. why isn t daredevil having sex with her when green  her character isn t like the hulk where she gets angry so she turns green. when she is green she is that which she most wants to look like and be as sexual as you can imagine. she does indeed have sex with multiple different people in the comicbook. however  I just feel that disney and new marvel writers dont understand the character. now they are trying to make her just a female version of the hulk and not her own established character traits that makes her own character. I didn t care to much for she-hulk and I think that is the issue only certain actors cantake a role of a somewhat liked character  but not top character and make them far better.for me the best example of doing so is quick silver in the comics was never a character I liked. the xmen films version was far more enjoyable and I have to credit the actor. even when we saw him in wandavision it gave us an idea as if we were going to see that character again. we all wanted to see him. the actress for she-hulk doesnt do that at all and the writers dont help. it is sad that when saying that daredevil will be in it. I then want to actually watch it  but not for just one episode. great video keep it up.
cox s dd was cool  but yup watered down compared to the netflix series. which is ok! clear the slate for a new dd series with the same actor who embodies dd in live action. but what everyone is forgetting is the fact that jen walters has always had a huge bedroom bodycount  and the show is from her perspective. its the same as the deadpool movies  otherwise the 4th wall breaking wouldn t make sense. personally yes  I have to keep that constantly in mind otherwise the show would be garbage. she sees the cameo superhero villains and everyone else as a certain way  so the show portrays them as such. thats why mom and dad are the goofy stereotypical sitcom parents. her brother cousin is a total lazy ass. and the few people she really does respect are the only well rounded characters in the bunch. her bff  the black female lawyer  and now matt.
matt s body count is twice as high as jen in comics. he has countless one night stands and makes even iron man look like a virgin by comparison.
@fernando martinez  if you write this comment one more time an angel gets its wings
@jonathan devereaux  I wrote it 68 more times so youre clearly delusional.
I actually had heard they added hackers into this mix  so if this going to be part of the story then it may have just saved this show  and things may get intense  and if this is the case then I will give it a shoot  but I want to hear more first. this could be the villian the show would need also to really make it take off because they would be hard to defeat.
she hulk is pretty much the villain of the show.
in the old comic books peter was setup and arrested when he was innocent! daredevil finds out and saves peter and figures out he is real spidermen! it was good series!
daredevil in this was good compared to she-hulk but compared to him in his own show it falls a little short
they murdered and violated daredevil  and in that order.
this video is more entertaining than the entire she-hulk series.
I took the whole award ceremony as  a huge slap in the face to the agenda they pushed in the show. she hulk was perceived to be winning an award for being the best female attorney. when in fact all they did just lined her up with all female attorneys  which diluted the value of that award.  or at least thats how I saw that.
about the thing between she hulk and daredevil. if this was the reverse  not having any news of she-hulk and then she shows up in the new daredevil show to then for the only episode she s here end up sleeping him and goodbye  I bet people would have call thatsexist for the way they treated her. well thats the same thing here.
I dont see the trail scene as an example of matt only beating jen because her client was an idiot  I see it as yet another example of jen being incompetant in her job for not checking all the facts of the case and questioning her client before hand on how he used his suit. this show wants us to think jen is a talented lawyer and its just everyone else holding her back or screwing her over  but she s only shown how bad she is at her job.
wait! thats daredevil !   looks more like the main character in the kick-ass movies. . . .minutes later  oh wait  that first guy was a completely different character - my bad  never mind!
melonie congrats on 60k thoughts on the yakuza games series
when you know nothing about daredevil besides the netflix series  that only loosely adapted some of his darkest runs  he is historically not that dark of a character. read just a few pages where he s featured in a she hulk or spider-man comic  he fits in different tones
daredevil is one of my favorite superhero s so I was super skeptical about him showing up in this show  the fight scenes were cool I have to admit but I really hate that he sleeps with she hulk just seems off for his character. will miss the gritty and bloody more serious tone of netflix s daredevil tho
ben affleck daredevil had the best costume.
the problem is that normally you would expect she-hulk to beat daredevil its not really a fair fight  however since marvel as a whole has set up the whole men cant beat women ever trope it becomes just another fight where she-hulk wins not because she s stronger but because constant plot armor
no it was not but Goddamnit it felt good to have him back for a bit
she-hulk is basically just a hole at this point.
of course in the end she beats him  I would have been surprised if he beat her. regardless of how crappy the show been so far she is still a hulk and does have super strength and invulnerability.
this is the second time thatshe goes into the court room without doing the do diligence. did they read the manual and check that they followed the instructions  no why would lawyers read and ask questions of there client.
I feel like charlie cox knew he was gonna eat the proverbial crow doing a guest spot on this show because the trade-off was getting his show back.
the hackers intelligencia are toxic anti-she-hulk trolls. so  us. she-hulk showrunner and writers   she-hulk was not made for toxic men! also she-hulk showrunner and writers  makes critical fans the villain
@thatharvguy  im ok with this then  maybe the point is to show how we really feel in the show.
I liked it its a cameo not a  vvv show
I heartily disagree.  this was the first episode of the series I liked and yes  it was partly because daredevil was in it  and yes my memberberries were tingled by the hallway fight in this one - although it was convenient the thugs had relatively slow and easily blocked crossbows rather than guns .  but it wasn t so much that he was in it - this was the first time itseemed like a real law show in the courtroom scenes  they gave them a reasonable excuse to fight and showed their different styles in handling conflict in both banter and action.  I had to double-check the writing credits as I was sure this wasn t written nor were the fights choreographed by the same writers  boggle .  Ive been hate-watching since episode 4  I was  meh  before that point  trying to give the show a fair chance but this episode I actually laughed twice!
my guy!!!they re all mad about dd but saying nothing about ka beung ruined!!
actually he s insanely promiscuous in comics. wolverine is the only one that has him beat and thats only because he s 6 times as old as him. matt s body count is twice as high as jen in comics. he has countless one night stands and makes even iron man look like a virgin by comparison.
no pun intended
she hulk is hit and miss  much more miss than hit  but .this was a really good episode.does it redeem the series  no. still  credit where its due.
daredevil was ok. at least he s back but this show. I agree with everything you say
nobody is talking about the end of this show  I think they just teased that wolverine might be in the final episode.at the very end when jen says  wait  is this the tease for the finale  is this the part where we see a red hulk or something evil   her friend literally jumps out with makeup sticks between her fingers  like wolverine claws   and jen looks back at the camera and goes  whatever it is  Im game .Ive literally seen nobody else talk abt this yet. not even youtube review channels. I feel like they re using daredevil to distract from his surprise cameo. also the tease earlier in the season when she was on the computer  itsaid  why is there a man with claws    what y all think
the property damage she inflicts as a lawyer is a nightmare
leap frog looks like he purchased the kick-ass costume from spirit halloween and the satisfying thing is seeing jen facing up to her demons for all to see yep they succeeded whereas titania failed all through the season daredevil ruined next deadpool and wolverine.
you are the embodiment of what every man should and needs in a women
I felt bad charlie.from career point  he got big improve but as their character it feels so watered down.think about that we could have full bloomed bullseye in season 4.  nstead we get cringy frog. t felt like knock off vigilante from peacemaker.base on kingpin cameo and this  I have doubts for deadpool 3 and  punisher.
the frogsuit guy just makes me want to watch kick@    or mystery men. infinitely better than this she-hulk s ability to  control her rage  and this show. its basically a superheroine diet alley mcbeal that has no clue on law.  btw  kudos to you for helping me find disparu on youtube  I think it may have been through twitter or whatever  lol
I often think about this  has any of the new phase 4 heroes ever actually cared about saving people more than thinking about themselves. spidey and dd put the needs of others above their own regardless of the trauma and suffering they experienced. thats what makes a good superhero.
re  letting mat win the casea problem there is  itstill shows how incompetent jen is as a lawyer as its her job to do the due diligence research  actually her paralegal   experts she should have contacted    be ready when she goes into court  it came across as though she was winging it   hadn t prepared at all  as though the meeting we saw was the only thing she knew.
daredevil always knows what he s doing. he s by no means stupid or incompetent.
but at least daredevil cant see the trainwreck that is this show.
frog man is a character from the comics  but they nerfed him. I cant wait for them to nerf white rabbit and the walrus
I haven t seen the show yet and I dont want too even though Im a big marvels fan. but I will watch the episode with daredevil because  you know  its daredevil!
its odd that these writers try to hate on men  when they re clearly so obsessed with them.
all fair critiques! on the walk of shame  that was probably just because he didn t bring a change of clothes so he had to walk out in his daredevil suit after he clearly got laid lol. they coulda let him have his boots tho at least
the few minutes daredevil was on screen fighting and bantsing with she hulk deadass made the show somewhat watchable. they should have went with that approach from the beginning
I remember when she got with the juggernaut the first time she met him....
they truly live in a bubble if they think this feels realistic lol
how could they say it was a walk of shame...to consenting adults do what it do...she the instigator made it perfectly clear that it was just going to be a 1 time thing and he liked to walk barefoot because the grass feels good I guess. so desperate to put the man down no matter what. ahhhhh!
I hope not. I dont want to see wolverine getting dragged into this dumpster fire of a show
that just sounds like you didn t watch any of phase 4
ah yes I loved how in nwh pete put others ahead of himself. like at the end when he told strange to cast a spell so nobody in the multiverse remembers peter. meaning both tobey  andrew and every variant of peter is now living in a world where none of their loved ones remember who they are. wow what a great hero!!!  10 10
I never said he was
have you seen these writers
pretty sure the guy who wrote this specific episode is a male comic book writer. I doubt he hates men lmao
regarding the  of course  she beats him.   I have to say that its absolutely logical and I dont see any agenda driven intention here.first of all  he wasn t even trying to fight her seriously  he tried to get away and catch the frog guy.and even if he had tried  despite all his experience and fighting skills  she would have devastated him  as soon as she had landed one hit.for the first time  I was also happy with she-hulk in this show. evidently  all tatiana maslany needed to make this character work  was a character beside her that is not a one-dimensional sock puppet clich . let her interact with an actual character and boom - suddenly its entertaining.
luke isn t gay  he s eccentric  like edna from the incredibles. the  eccentric superhero outfit designer  trope.
the daredevil in this show was not really the dd in the netflix series  its a different guy entirely.  but damn the cgI of she hulk looks like a cutscene from 1998.  that is just awful.but she beats him because its her comic  those are the comic book rules.  along with  when heroes meet  they fight
she was literally destroying the building  thats why they arrested her
the writers  marveled  while the audience sat in shame and disappointment.
great now I got to watch she hulk   dd is my favorite
just about every single case she has worked has contained some conflict of interest  between the abomination case  the case involving her former coworker  the case involving this dress costume maker.I think there are actually fewer where there is no conflict of interest. which is hilariously bad for a show about a lawyer.
jens a bit of a horn dog   it dont take much !
what s frustrating with the mcu fans is when the scenes of daredevil got uploaded comments were flooding in saying  yay! its so nice seeing daredevil smile  he deserves itsince his show is so dark and gloomy!  or another comment I read was  daredevil cant be serious forever  he isn t batman  which just annoyed the crap out of me. now not all comments were sucking up to marvel some even said that the jokes he made in she-hulk were fine so long as in his show we go back to the serious tone. my main issue with his appearance was the cgI being awful.and one more thing. the daredevil netflix show made me care about characters I couldn t give less of a shit about  it reminded me of iron man back in 2008. I didn t really know the character but rdj and marvel writers back then did a great job with his movie that he easily became one of my top 5 marvel heroes over the years since his first movie. we re in dark times with marvel  dr. strange  thor l t and she-hulk have been huge disappointments this year  hopefully wakanda forever stops that trend.
damn daredevil went from elecktra to maeby f nke!I guess matt really is blind!
I was watching a few of your videos  I respect your takes  interesting breakdowns  I used to be really anti-feminist  and antI social politics  but my perspective has shifted  while maybe in some instances it can get taken too far  I think it does matter to be able to speak to injustices
I like shipping and all. but I really like to focus on those small things when they blue ball you. small things small moments. slow burn. here is first episode with daredevil and they go to bed together. just no. it would be better if matt was there in the show from the beginning and they would  fight  with each other in court  and then in 8 episode they would kiss or something
to be fair  frogman was always a goober in the comics. although they seem to have done some flip flopping here  bc while he s generally a goof  he was a hero trying to redeem the suit from his villain father  who was mentioned on the show a few times. but they made him a villain instead  idk  seems off to me.
to be fair how many episodes in season 1 was matt murdock kicking ass in just black clothes  was it more or less than 10
nice one mel   you are as always  a breath of fresh air
hImelonie I have no intrist on seeing shehulk. I did like watching daredevil series.that being said you had doneanother wonderful video.takecare melonie
3 11 the reason why it felt better was that for once she was a real lawyer...
what s the difference between daredevil and scarlet witch one knows how to cope without vision.
all she-hulk did was make me miss netflix s daredevil.
we knew they couldn t show daredevil without having her crap on him first.
woah  this perfectly logical and rational comment has no place here!
give the writers a break man. its not like they have an access to a platoon of disney marvel lawyers that they could have consult. or even an unpaid internship with disney marvel that any law student would die for the opportunity.
@melonwatermelon  its not like it would even take a lawyer of the caliber disney marvel generally hire to tell them just how bad the legal aspects in the show are. they could hire the cheapest lawyer they could find and still end up with better results than they ended up with.
so is matt
also walk o shame...like girls do that do to their feet get swollen after wearing those stupid shoes ...why no boots
so basically bruce was right and jen cant control her anger when put in a difficult situation.
I bet this version of daredevil sees the world as one big burning pride flag.
have youread comics melonie  there s a ton of great stories to get into. the movies are scratching the surface of what s in the comics. read ultimate spider-man and batman knightfall if youre interested.
can someone please finaly explain me why the main character  she-hulk  got a cgI face and not just green make-up  does she look any different expect being green
I knew people would make themselves look foolish trying to complain about daredevil in this episode.
I couldn t believe what they did to daredevil
your review is bang on. love you gorgeous!
yep and even the actor who plays she hulk said things got better ever since daredevil showed up. its funny you know they talk about men hating yet she is the only one making out with dudes left and right. this is why they say men are the prize if the men can just leave and not get yelled at after sleeping with a women. also I like how during the walk of shame he didn t have he s kane with him. also love the hair dresser guy and he s a rare case for someone to be likable gay character. like yha he so reminds me of edna and I hope he sees the comments about him and would like to push the role further.
I wasn t sure I needed the sex scene. but tbf it is kinda she-hulk for that to happen. the first she-hulk comic I read she was getting up from bedding tony stark.and from what Ive heard from friends who are big readers of daredevil he is known to sleep around.people may moan it promotes hook up culture or whatever  but its also quite on character.
episode 8 could have and should have been episode 2
melonie is such a natural beauty
re she-hulk beating matt  well  to be fair  it would be hard for even talented writers to find a way for daredevil to beat she-hulk  even this dippy version of her. but they couldn t even come up with a reasonable way for matt to have a hallway fight -- though admittedly it looked better than any other fight in this series  by far . until jennifer straight-up kills some of the goons by tromping down on them with enough force to smash a concrete roof.  does this upset matt  not really. how did she know where to crunch through the roof to stomp those guys  daredevil powers  I guess matt was wrong  for no reason  about the need to be careful about alerting the villains so as not to endanger the captive
I feel like even though things happened in this episode nothing really happenes in thus episode which is a problem with this series in general its always spending a ehole episode a week doing nothing
hI love your videos. finally a youtube girl that has her head on straight besides thatstar wars girl. I like her but there needs to be more girls that realize what the media   society is doing instead of shaming men for everything
thought she-hulk could control her anger better then bruce  yet she freaks out at every opportunity.
I agree with everything you said here.she tried to kill him without even asking question  even attacking first  destroying a parking garage that could have killed numerous innocents below them. the cgI and audio was terrible in the fight. daredevil is not superpowered physically. to cgI his parts of the fight scenes is just absolutely lazy. look at the netflix daredevil fight scenes after watching this.as for she hulk beating daredevil  well of course she hulk would win. daredevil cant hurt a hulk. its not the same level character. daredevil only has super senses.
had they not got the original actor  this would ve bombed badly. I feel this hurt the daredevil series when they make it  they ll literally have to bring back the original whole crew plus punisher to hopefully salvage and make daredevil somewhat decent    sucks because the netflix version was easily my fav and how they crossed the punisher  so perfectly between it just for disney to probably ruin it all
the tsar h bomb landing on disney plus isn t enough to redeem thatshow.
the frog guy  in the beginning  is a good summation of the writer s mindset too. I dont need to train. all I need is a title and a suit and if I suck at what I do  then it is someone elses fault. the twitter comments about women getting threatened by cops for defining herself is so stupid in regard to she-hulk and the situation in the show.she is a Goddamn hulk. the kind who can flatten entire cities if enraged enough. so story wise it is appropriate for the police to prevent that. but understanding that would require these gender politicians to  a.  understand the universe they have chosen to represent them.and b.  to think beyond the  women   weak and oppressed  man bad and powerful  narrative that they are spinning.
men wear comfortable shoes that fitso if you see a dude leaving without his shoes its not the sex he regrets  its not thatshe s ugly  its because the chick has hygiene issues.learned a lot about  jen  in this episode.
@fernando martinez  lol spidey has way more.
@mr mxyzptlk  I thought so but it turns out no. spiderman doesnt have a whole lot of intentional one night stands. its more like circumstances cause potential relationships to fall apart soon after.
its called tribalism
the only likeable character in the show is the only one when the writers didn t have to write it themselves. like you said they just copied edna
trust me the writers did not know it was on character. Im willing to bet the house that the writers never did any kind of research or read any comic.
@melonwatermelon  very probable. either way it worked out... fine. at least in this episode.
I d say that was a teaser.
I thought this episode was pretty good compared to the rest of the series
she definitely didn t save matt. he could ve fought another 15 men at least in that hallway.
itsucks that black widow isn t alive anymore cause I d love to see him and her interact. and  jessica jones has more sex than anyone else I seen in marvel so I didn t mind she hulk and matt doing it and matt has chemistry with everyone he had like 4 relationships in his own show. daredevil should have been in this show the whole time he added more depth to jen and their convo than anything else so far
I agree dare devil teased and late appearance didnt redeemed either the characters she hulk or the show she-hulk attorney at flaw  he is not a strong and independant woman   with a career  and doesnt have to deal with issues that a lawyer woman have to in 2022 but at least something happened plot wise in episode 8 and it is so much more than episode 2 3 4 5 6so far all you need is episode 1  7  8 and maybe 6 if youreally want to digg deeper into the story even though 6 might be the worse of them all  but even the plot is not good enought to  redeem  the rest so  episode 9 need to be a masterpiece  otherwise I d say she-hulk attorney at flaw is the worse mcu project yet now only one is left and it will be the end of this  it cannot be worse than what we ve seen so far and I really hope they wont come back for a season 2 or that if they do  they will change the writters or just reboot it entirelly  deadpool style
to be fair daredevil never stood a chance because he s just a guy with batons  physically speaking  while she hulk is a hulk   apparently stronger in ways than actual hulk because strong woman   woke disneymarvel.
dd was always my fave marvel char but I was more of a dc kid so I didn t read a ton of his book.  I did devour his show  though  and the idea of matt hopping into bed like thatseems... incongruous with his earlier tv characterization with charlie cox.
there s only one live action daredevil. netflix daredevil.
oh wow  this actually makes me not want a disney  daredevil show anymore.
hey  maybe next time I will buy you dinner and we cantry and have a connection  nah  lets have a  one-night stand instead then surprised pikachu-face thatshe cant get a meaningful relationship. the hook-up culture is poison.
I enjoy the show as a man... I see where your coming from on most of this but they absolutely got dd right... we even got a hallway fight... and Im sorry but the walk of shame was hilarious
as far as vigilante super heroes go I like daredevil better than batman  and he actually has super powers. but I liked the red costume better.
was the frog villain supposed to represent cyber frog
thatshe hulk is superior to daredevil in battle makes sense to me.  she is a lot stronger and plays a league over him when it comes to superpowers
so...there was no conflict of interest between she-hulk and her tailor
tim roth has been excellent.
part of the cultural phenomenon we re seeing is a tighter feedback loop of  art imitating life imitating art...   with growing distortion  like a copy of a copy.  younger generations have been ever more influenced by dramatised  life  as it has been displayed in the media  which has influenced their perceptions of life and humanity.  their worldviews are more hollywood influenced than they are a composite of actual experiences and relationships.  these people grow up to further project and dramatise these values in making the next generation of media.  those of us without our heads stuck in the sand of mass media indoctrination see just how far it is from real life and are left bewildered and shaking our heads.for an example  look at relationships  relationships in film and tv are distorted to be more dramatic  more entertaining.  people watch  and come to believe that these portrayals are showing  love  and  passion   and enact those tropes in their relationships - high drama  pseudointellectually deconstructed caricatures.  as the old tropes become the new normal  media portrayals need to be even more dramatic to stand out from  real life   and so on.the suspension of disbelief has been too successful for these people  and everybody suffers for it.
when the best part of a show is the guest star its a bad sign.
I guess thats why disney is picking the d list villains   easy to mess with. also welcome to the  darkside of comics  heroes are hornballs
what was there to redeem
wonder if they had been watching youtube alot as the bad guys remind most of us of our good friend overLord dvd  mask-voice etc
actually matt has a higher body count than jessica jones.
ironically matt is the kind to take a woman to dinner  have a one night stand  then avoid her the next day in comics. matt s body count is twice as high as jen s. he has countless one night stands and makes even iron man look like a virgin by comparison.
we dont expect hawkeye to be professor hulk either.
barely an incomvienience
even madysinn was better than jen.
daredevil himself was mostly fine but no its not enough to make the whole trash pile smell good lol
d.d. isn t going to take she-hulk in a fight anyway.
3 20 technically the case being dismissed was jen s fault because she didn t even prep leapfrog. if she had  she would ve found evidence of him using the wrong fuel for his boosters and dropped him as a client. sure it was dumb of leapfrog to blurt it out in court  but considering that was the deciding factor in the dismissal  the first thing jen should ve looked into was the supposed malfunctioned suit luke made for leafrog   considering  you know  its the entire reason leapfrog was suing. jen s just a terrible lawyer.
had to shoot ya the subscription today. found your videos the other day and I love it!
okay  full disclosure  I have not watched a lick of she-hulk  I just clicked on this because daredevil is in your title...and as Im watching this vid  that daredevil is the same one from netflix s series  actor and all. ...Im starting to feel like to do need to watch this show to see what s up because  and I know Im speaking for many when I say this  netflix s daredevil was amazing.
hey this comment isn t related to the video or anything but I just wanted to say that I think ur channel name is absolutely amazing! itsounds so cool ngl. also I love your voice just bcoz of the fact that itsounds so different to others.
is todd the leader. the one from the date and he called her a specimen
at least werewolf by night was great. she hulk was decent for first few eps but at this point I cant defend it
its funny how stan lee made daredevil for the blind to represent them as an imaginary character but bring awareness to them. by making dd a sexist joke and destroying his character all together does more damage to the blind community than the  toxic fan boys  they re aiming at.
4 30 to be fair  she is a hulk. and he is just a skilled fighter soo..
when the damage has already been done  a flower among the rubble may look beautiful but it will wither all the same.
does she not know about frog man in the comics how he is
daredevil is a unique character not well known to alot of marvel fans. he has a loyal following and shouldnt have to used as a second rate character to save a disaster of a show.
Ive watched every season of daredevil multiple times  so trust me when I tell you  she- hulk and daredevil have absolutely no chemistry. he s too good for her.
I thought this would just be   no   it did not  no.
and melonie  I think its an exaggeration to say that the portrayal of leap frog was a portrayal of the male gender. where do you get that leap of judgment  btw been a fan of yours since your dark souls 2 playthrough vids and the first time you played league
he did great but thatstill wont save it
the part when he introduced himself as daredevil and she is just like   that was awful
this makes me so sad they take these great characters  and ruin them for the next decade at least. like all this has to be cannon now  I d much rather they never made the show.
she-hulk gets more pricks than a pin cushion.
take that back!!she s a great lawyer.. for your opponenent habe!!just sit there til her client embarsses them or she wants a contract signed under duress - job done
majority of people who liked the netflix series liked this episode. she s just farming outrage
I challenge you to a duel  sir!!
@darren gordon-hill  ok meet me in the comment section of melonie s next she hulk video
except he s almost always a secondary character in shows like fantastic 4 and spiderman.
@fernando martinez  I know  Ive read both comics. their body counts dont change that they have nothing in common.

she was talking about how every man in the series is portrayed  not just leapfrog
@johannes stephanus roos  unless they re gay.spend so much time hating on men they cant see how inept they themselves arelike jen being unaware he ignored manufacturer s instructions cos too busy mocking him for  wanting tI help actually shoud ve kidnapped she-hlk for her bad representation as his attorney - not sure why he became the villain
daredevil doesnt make news outside of hell s kitchen.
only one thing could possibly redeem shite-hulk  being burned at the stake...
no it wasn t enough. but Goddamn that episode was amazing. its far too late to save she hulk  Im starting to think you just hate everything cuz to deny this episode as the best episode of the series so far is nuts. this may be the only time to give this show flowers  we already know how bad the writing has been
this is why Im so surprised that people trust disney when it comes to deadpool. one of the main reasons why I canceled all my screen services.fool me once shame on you.fool me twice shame on me.with all that going on I rather save my money.
have you ever thought of going on friday night tights with nerdrotic and geeks and gamers. you d fit in there perfectly
this show is as you said dreadful. these people get paid to do this I am so just jealous now
the problem they have with she-hulk is that they try and have their cake and eat it  - hulk was seen as a criminal because the military saw him as a threat and when attacked hulk countered viciously  breaking a lot of stuff. it wasn t until he joined the avengers that he was somewhat rehabilitated and seen for the complex character he in reality is.- she-hulk is being presented as this character that everyone instantly likes  without even a glimpse of reasoning why thatshould be the case. yes  ostensibly she has better control over her hulk than the actual hulk had  but as she breaks about as much stuff as hulk does when she fights  what s the difference the creators desperately try to push thatshe-hulk has better control because she s a wahmen and therefore must be liked no matter how much she destroys  whereas hulk is just a man and therefore unlikeable.
daredevil is the best part of this show
literally all she had to do was clap really hard and d.d would have been incapacitated long enough to grab him then its game over...wtf why is her go to move always punch the fkn ground  she literally has super speed and strength. just casual property damage and because it was ineffective it was for no reason.
daredevil being unmasked  just like that  is a massive issue for that character s kudos. it basically makes him a      . but hey...the writers have stated  its satire  so....destroying your characters  cool factor just isn t a problem  huh
to answer the title  obviously not. this is episode 8 of 9
there was a recent report that 80  of twitter is bots. I dont want to claim that everyone who has a differing opinion is a bot  but it really does make you wonder if these are legitimate fans or bots advertising the show.
looking good melonie mac looking real good
charlie deserves better!!
why go out of their way to have jen say she can control her anger suuuuper well  just to have plenty of scenes where she just cant control her anger at all
if I was running a hotel event venue I would hope the police would show up to arrest the crazy person destroying the property Im responsible for.
Im also seeing its not as cut and dried like you make it out to be. the show is from her perspective  so characters like leapfrog  the wrecking crew  el matador  and manbull  are seen as jokes  just as much as her boss and the stooge- douche co-worker with the shoe fetish. the matt jen hookup was as jen  and showed matt walking in the grass barefoot. thats not walk of shame behavior. thats a good night happy with the world behavior.  all though I wouldn t walk in grass anywhere in any big city in fear of getting stuck by a druggy needle. especially la  all the wolvie references hopefully will be an end credits scene which could build up fellow breaker of 4th walls  deadpool s movie  which was recently announced  so maybe all the wolvie references is just an homage to jackman s dp3 part  and nothing more. though it would be cool for either a jackman cameo  or a reveal of who will be logan proper in the mcu. doubtful  but cool either way. considering mutants wont be a full tilt reveal til 2024  the teases are fun.
my gosh  she s literally the town bike. no wonder why she s so lonely  all she cares about is fucking on the first date  and she doesnt make time to build any type of proper relationships. I d take an old-school  short time-span disney romance like aladdin and jasmine  ariel and eric  hercules and meg  any day over this. hell  even on that last one with hercules and meg  meg had even more reason to be bitter with men than she-hulk  and still opened herself up to hercules after seeing his determined and protective nature. all jen does is whine and scream about how patriarchy is awful and men are evil but still chases after dick like its a fucking unicorn.gosh dang  Imiss the cartoon she-hulk  where she was sexy and sweet. where she was so confident thatshe was hardcore flirting with the thing  where she walks past a family and the little girl says  mommy  I want to be like her when I grow up   and even the dad was smitten   where she placed herself as a shield to protect some girls in a beauty pageant who were being targeted. give me that jen.
she-hulk doesnt have x-ray vision ...how d she know who she d be smashing slamming through the roof like she did  its not just she has no experience as hero  jen walters the person doesnt ever really seem to consider anyone she doesnt see in the mirror.
this is the only episode I watched  and turned it off when daredevil left.  although  I am going to suffer through the season finale
looks like she hulk totally destroyed the ground of the car park and made it a safety hazard and dosent seem to care at allmost likely would be security cameras and you would think a lawyer wouldnt do stupid shit that can easily get them sued then she gets nominated an award for lawyer of the year
Ive already been on twice  was a great time
the writer wrote she hulk as a coping mechanism for every challenges they faced irl. they self insert every wishful thinking they ve ever had into this show. they wish they had talked back to that a-hole coworker that one time. they wish they can just stuff their face and men would just come up and hit on them. the only reason they never got further in their career is because men bad. every failure of theirs is actually the fault of men because they can do no wrong. its actually pathetic
@melonwatermelon  I assume that by challenges you mean perceived challenges   because if those are all the challenges they have faced  they re laughably privileged and unchallenged.
@tj roelsma  well I dont know to what extend their challenges are  many they actually had sexist coworkers who knows  but judging from the writing of this show I presume they have had similar encounters and they wrote how they wished they responded or how they wished the world to view them. this show from top to bottom is wish fulfillment of a wine mom single 40s women
I think its more about she doesnt listen to bruce and she comes to realize thatshe should later on. but there s no telling with bruce being off world now
that was self defence!!!!
cartoon she-hulk gain confident in her hulk form and was a meek shy full of self doubt jen. that cant be the case here because in the show women are perfect in everyway and can do no wrong  its society and men that are wrong. self improvement and character growth are for suckers
he is the only decent thing that happened in this entire series  I hate what they did to she hulk  this show should have been great.
can someone who has a job send melonie  10 so she can buy herself a hairbrush
remember the incredible hulk movie when bruce had to interrupt the foreplay because his heart beats were racing  so what im tripping on is how the hell can she-hulk can go on her hook up spree and be ok  lol plus its incredible how they re hating on men in this show when this show itself is named after a male character
not related to this absolute unchecked trash fire of a show  but the light makeup  fresh-faced look is good for you. nothing wrong with winged eyeliner  but I  a super important random person from the internet  think this is an improvement.
Im sure you get a lot of girls coming at you for not sticking with the girl power in this show
Ive still got a question   if that gay designer is supposed to be the costumer to the stars  or to the super-heroes I guess   who exactly has he designed costumes for   cause I cant think of any super-heroes in the mcu that got their costumes  or uniforms  from him.  not captain america   not spider-man   not thor   not hulk  doesnt even have a costume besides purple pants    not hawkeye   ant-man...well  none of them that we have seen so far.   so where is he getting this great reputation that it would have come to daredevil s attention way over in hell s kitchen new york  oh yeah   he did do leap frog  oh boy .   I think he might lose his  gay card   if thats the best designs he can come up with.  and where does he get any knowledge of weapons and armor  rockets and jets and so on.  that doesnt fall under the usual fashion design background.  tony stark   hank pym or shuri...to name a few people in the mcu I would believe could design super-hero costumes that actually could work in battle but not this guy.  oh yeah   and he is the guy who makes the  devil  guy s costume yellow and red instead of just making it totally red like any normal person would imagine a devil would be.
jen not even asking details from frogman on how his boots caught fire or what fuel he uses and stuff... thats just bad lawyering.
the first  decent  episode.
Im really enjoying this show. I love this episode. greetings from brazil
being chaste is the new cool.
guess Im going against the grain  but this was the only episode that didn t make me physically ill. charlie just steals it and I never felt he was  disrespected .but whenever she hulk enters the frame I still went booooh!  . humor is still pretty bad.
I dont get  the walk of shame  what was thatsupposed to entail  that he was a piece of ass and thatshe kicked him out  but then in the next episode he literally meets her family and has a barbecue with them. so then what was that all about then  it makes absolutely no sense. I feel like the director is daredevil because she s definitely directing this blind.
the best part is when finally the show ends we dont have to suffer this ever again...........right ......
to be fair  and even as a straight man  if I got a 24 hour window to hook up with daredevil  Im going to take it too
even a woman admits she-hulk is bad
the she-hulk in the fighting game ultimate marvel vs capcom 3 looked better. was more likeable too.
I bet wongers will save the finale.
far far better the director and writers want to destroy the fans
not that I like this show. because I dont . and for good reasons. but her being violent off a few things daredevil says. is probably one of the most realistically accurate things this show has done. like how certain women first reaction is to beat the hell out of u for saying a comeback thats not even that bad. and Im sure there is plenty more but man oh man. I actually have female superheroes I like. so its not even that. its how they did it. Ima say it like I did before. I have seen better ideas in the comment section. its like they say in the hood. damn near everything marvel gets....... gets turned out...  the marvel way.
4 27 nahhhh let s be objective on this one. there s no way in God s green earth he beats jen so thats at least accurate
lol thats just how naturally textured hair works. trust me if I brush out my curls while dry they will be nothing but frizz
this will get a second season for the same reason batwoman got two more than was needed  .... spite.
@todd taylor  batwomen movie did died a horrible death. are hollywood execs waking up finally
@fernando martinez  I know matt s is high  I think tony  jen  and matt are like top 3. widow amd wolverine are up there  but I could have swore shulk was the err  ummm  heavy weight champ in that categoryedit  body count of hook ups with other supers  I think thats what I was thinking of. as far as in general  yeah probably matt
@seanchan  from what I researched  wolverine has the highest but thats just because he s lived the longest. if we compared him to others  its actually low on a per year and per decade statistic. iron man has a higher body count than she-hulk and daredevil has the most for a mortal man. I found some saying that black widow s was high and others thatsaid it wasn t all that high at all.
@fernando martinez  might wanna clear your search history tonight lol
she was truly jenny from the block
the writers of this show live in a bizzaro world of their own making where normal morality and common sense dont exist. thus the show is a window into this unique psychosis. it may even be helpful in future university courses on abnormal phycology. so its not completely useless  right
so where is the post creditscene
nope.. despite charlie cox s tremendous effort.. he actually made jen. likable for once  and his banter with her was fun.. it was almost a fun episode... almost.
redeem  no. improve  yes.
the writers have accidentally and successfully made she hulk a very hypocritical and bratty character. I say accidentally  because even though she denied bruce s help with controlling emotions and forgot everything matt told her about being able to do good in and out of the law  I feel that they wont make her regret her choice of destroying the gala. she ll just keep on trucking  no lesson learned.
I truly thank you for your reviews so I dont have to actually sit through watching this whole terrible show.
I have 0 hope for dare devil reborn....
watching melonie try to act like the gay guy and failing made this video all worth it. the dude is even outdoing women in acting extra fake feminine.
why did they add gold to daredevil s suit   just to somehow imply that thats not the same dd from netflix universe
thanks for saving me the time from watching this show. I only watched the first 3 ep. but I stopped because it was boring for me. I guess I ll just skipped to ep 8 just for daredevil. much appreciated
its so weird that they chose she-hulk to be the feminist  men bashing show of all characters..if anything  she-hulk is probably one of the more beloved and iconic female characters in the comics.or at least.. thats how it used to be.love your hair btw.
11 45 this is what hornpub is for     yet they react like this for she-hulk episode. xd
so its ok for her to initiate the  hit it and quit it  strategy with matt  but when a guy does it to her  he s a piece of shit. tells you a lot about the writers of this show tbh.
people did not believe me when I said she hulk was the villain in her own show  well eat your heart out people
personally her winning the fight wasn t too bad for me  since...yknow  she s a hulk...in the mcu dd hasn t faced anyone like her before honestly  I was just so happy to see him again. hope we see punisher  jones  cage  and iron fist again too
they say something is great just for one little scene of cameos.if a man s life is defined for just one big mistake  while most of the time he struggles to do better....this is the same  but the opposite way..1 8 of she hulk is acceptable and people watched for matthew... not for jennifer..thats a pity.this is not going to change. we pay. we dont deserve  leftovers   small mercies  etc
at least matt destroyed her because her portrait of a lousy lawyer. lawyers have to ask and investigate these things. what really happened and plan a good way to win
they only added daredevil to immaculate him.
marvel writing matt murdock hooking up with she hulk thatsoon  is entirely contrary to matt murdock s character.  matt would never do that.  but hey  what do I know
what was the fuel supposed to be
there s no lesson to be learn because women are perfect to begin with. its not her fault  its the men s and society fault.          - she-hulk writers  probably
@melonwatermelon   its actually a metaphor for nature and how there s a storm inside every woman  waiting to unleash because of what society has done to us.
if he is the same daredevil  bullseye ruined his image by stealing the suit and he might be looking for a friendlier appearance. plus he mentioned he had multiple suits made.
emasculatethey immaculately emasculated him
talking about stupid  how many superheroes or vigilantes would choose a clothier since it would kinda defeat the purpose of concealing your identity. 4 43 saying she beats him at least to me feel like taking things out of context  she is a big hulking monster I doubt he really knows if is friend or foe at that point. so imagine his just feeling the situation out and decide to leave since she isn t his actual mission goal. I think that just make sense  why would you even fight a big hulking seeming monster you dont know if its not part of any means to successfully achieve your mission objective  it would just feel like unnecessary risk and waste of time  but maybe I am the only one that feels this way about seeing thatscene.find her having sex with daredevil isn t it the author glorifying toxic masculinity writing him to cheat on his love interest from previous show
not going to lie the way jennifer walters loses that court case actually makes her look really dumb  which surprised me. I was also surprised they let her appear in court as jennifer walters considering she works for a superhero law firm and was told she would be in superhero form all the time.... but I guess they figured it d be unrealistic for matt murdock to be into she-hulk  but back to the losing of the case  absolutely! the most basic of idiot lawyer would have made sure that their client was using the product as intended before it ever agreeing to that case... the fact that jennifer didn t was an absolutely mind-blowing to me and had me shouting at the tv the whole time. this was absolutely the dumbest episode yet which is saying something
it has got to be hard bard being a puck me girl when imaginary women have better jobs and lives than you  and you know deep down that on your best day that the partner you eventually find  would still pick jen over you given the choice.
the frog guy is a real character btw
I couldn t agree more with you
your so beautiful  and then listening to you is such a blessing.. thank the world for producing this
she complains a lot like she write the show and directed it  d
it honestly feels like they violated him  and the walk of shame was a joke at his humiliation...
actually  she-hulk beats daredevil not because woke feminism demands that the woman wins. in this case  daredevil is barely a superhero. he has amazing hearing and smell and he s kinda quick and good at karate. thats about it. specifically  he s had  ninja  training and is probably an olympic level athlete. she-hulk is a major superhero strong enough to be on the avengers. way above the olympics  indestructible  super strong  other powers like super leaping and such. she absolutely should kick his butt up one side and down the other. every day. all day long. even without feminism on her side.youre also wrong about the hallway fight.she-hulk didn t save daredevil. he just took out some guys and then she took out some guys. Im quite sure daredevil would have wiped out the second group as easily as the first group but she-hulk got impatient and barged in. it was meant to be funny and she did not  in any way  save him from doing what they just showed him doing  kicking a bunch of goon butts.I get it. you get more likes and more subs if you trash-talk this show at every turn  especially if you can hang the  woke  or  feminist  label on the writers in every scene. but neither of these scenes I describe here have anything to do with that. of course the super-powered superhero beats the barely-powered sort-of-ninja guy. and of course she-hulk being impatient doesnt mean that daredevil needed saving when he was successfully  even easily  winning the fight.
I get we want to hate them making men look weak but she hulk is a literally hulk   daredevil wouldn t stand a chance the best he could do is evade for a bit plus he doesnt want to fight her to the death he s not going to use some crazy weapon and put up a serious fight
she-hulk cringe  but how is dd supposed to beat her
I would do the walk of shame too if I knowingly slept with this version of she hulk
the cgI is revolting. the way the light bounces of everything as if every object and texture had been coated with bee wax  or during night scene  no contrast whatsoever.then the animations  the jagged weight shifts between two steps or when throwing something  the clumsy facial expressions  the absence of inertia force when something heavy is moved or launched  and the awkward physics when someone or something is landing crashing on the ground...this is so 2002 in terms of execution that I expect a matrix  bullet-dodging  parody in the next episode.
jen is ridiculously easy to bed and its increasingly making her look like a fool. you d think she d be more guarded after the last two guys let her down.
damn itseems like she got angry
how was there footage of her and josh hooking up   either josh had to set it up beforehand or jen regularly films herself hooking up with dudes.  or she was so drunk or in lust thatshe either didn t notice him setting it up or didn t care.  while it was wrong of him to film them having sex  it also kind of feels like she brought it on herself if she completely didn t care and allowed the filming to happen instead of telling him not to do it when he was setting it up to film.
is the green suit man kick-ass  lmao
they massacred my boy. cap and dd are my favorite marvel characters and they were the best rated characters by far and I was so grateful. until now.  now they re pulling this with matt and pretending falcon needs carrots caps sloppy seconds. its embarrassing.  the mcu died with endgame
the fighting scenes with him was fairly decent  except the horrible cgi. I cant stand his outfit though  but I guess thats just me.
I see pictures of the fashion guy and all I see is hollywood montrose from the greatest film ever manican and he came back for manican 2
I never said he wasn t lol
@melonie mac go boom  you clearly dont know about him thats for sure
seemed pretty happy to me
@brenda spence  how they write the character to feel is quite different to the situation.1  the walk of shame made no sense. he doesnt need to walk barefoot  he has boots not heels. he also wouldn t walk in broad daylight casually like that.2  the walk of shame is by nature shameful  the joke is by nature humiliating and at his expense. I understand she-hulk being all over him  he is gorgeous  but it feels out of character from what we see of him in the netflix show. promiscuous sex  I would argue doesnt make a lot of people happy. pleasurable sure  but happy  no. just look at jen s love life.
matt s body count is twice as high as jen in comics. he has countless one night stands and hook ups and makes even iron man look like a virgin by comparison.
thanks for having some sense
lol thats fair
yikes
I filmed myself and my girlfriend without her noticing back in the day. I used an app called spy camera on my phone and when I finally told her  she was confused but not angry.
@fernando martinez  confused why you would do such a fucked up thing without her consent
@brenda spence  it was 5 years ago and Ive grown and learned since then but I suppose its because I wanted my first time on camera. I was an 18 year old creep but we ve worked it out. Im hoping to propose soon. my point though was that its actually easier to do than people think.
@brenda spence  I know itsounds fucked up but at the time I saw it as preserving a memory of the first time. I was young and stupid and in love with her and I saw it as a chance for us to see our growth from our first time to way later on. turth be told you it was so poxalated and poor quality that you couldn t even tell it was us specifically. I didn t realize how fucked up it was until I gave itsome real thought and we talked about it. she wasn t angry with me but defintely felt uncomfortable. we managed to work through eachothers shortcomings though. like I said  I know how fucked up itsounds. all the more reason to warn ladies to place the phone away from view regardless of if the camera is on or not. which I do warn now.
dd literally acts how he does in the comics here and captain america was taken up but falcon in the comics long before it was ever put in a movie  you probably wouldn t even complain if bucky took up the shield. its not a problem when the comics do it but its an issue when it transitions to the big screen for some reason and disturbs people
@fernando martinez  what s that have to do with anything
this episode was written by a man.Im not saying that all male writers are good. Im also not saying that all male writers are better than female writers. the previous episode with the therapy session at abominaiton s hippy retreat was the only other episode written by a man and it wasn t a very good episode.but these two episodes have one thing in common  they didn t make jen look awesome by crapping all over the men in the show.in episode 7  some of the men were reasonable  some were dumb. but so was jen  spending a whole episode whining about her boyfriend not calling after 3 dates. she s a smart  successful professional lawyer in her mid-30 s  why is she acting like a 14 year old in jr. high in episode 8  matt murdock beats jen in the courtroom and nearly holds his own when very outmatched in their fight scene  then definitely holds his own fighting the bad guys. and in this episode  both matt and jen are likeable and fun to watch. first time for both of them in this show  but matt has a good excuse .now I wont say that male writers are better than female writers. Ive now denied that twice.but I will say that these male writers  especially cody ziglar who wrote episode 8  are better than these female writers who wrote the other episodes of this show. much better.for a lot of reasons.
yeah the only reason I stayed this long was because of care devil
this was the only episode that was moderately entertaining  and it was only because of daredevil.
sadly  this   hook up   culture is almost considered normal in this day and age. the things I saw  the body count on some young women in their twenties... I swear  it pushed me to celibacy voluntarily. the writers of this show really dont see nothing wrong with she hulk self destructive behaviors  cause they probably do worse.
the streets are callin lol  I liked daredevils part but no it did not save the show
glad to see matt finally  too bad he became just another booty call.
whos looking to season 2 of shr hulk...
womp-womp  looks like Im the only one who didn t like how daredevil was portrayed. in part because we were spoiled so much by his netflix show. I felt like  at least in this episode  the fight choreography and action directing was a lot worse. for starters  they had to make him cgI when fighting she-hulk  which looked and felt rubbery -- there was no impact to any of the action. plus  when they were quipping during the fight  it was clearly recorded in a studio and then dubbed over the actual scene. the level of strain seen on screen did not match the really subdued level of strain I heard in their voices. it robbed a lot of what was happening off impact.but the worst thing to me was that they turned him into an incompetent  mansplainer . she effortlessly revealed his identity. and then later  when they went to take down leap frog  not only did he not respect her abilities. he was made to look like he was just clowning around compared to her. and then when he just started talking about legal matters right in front of everyone in costume  or walking around in costume in a residential neighborhood in broad daylight. he should not make himself a target like this.dont know my dudes  but those are a lot of details that to me made for a pretty incomptetent superhero. daredevil deserves better than this.thatsaid. the original netflix show may be my favorite show ever. charlie cox and crew are some of the most wholesome people in show business and Im happy the save daredevil campaign got him into the mcu. he cares a lot for the fans  which by and large seem to be enjoy this episode. so  Im genuinely happy thatso many people got something out of charlie cox in this episode  even if Im sorrt of iffy on it.
I couldnt agree with you more. my dissapointment hit basement level with the writing on introducing him into this show. and going from the daredevil series where he hit rock bottom  and then he goes from that to this happy go lucky matt murdock  its just stupid writing once again. lets hope the new daredevil series is good. check that one out melonie if u dont know about that one. its going to be a pretty dark themed 18 episode series in 2024 called  daredevil  born again. its based on the 1986 comicbook written by frank miller.hopefully disney wont turn it into this outlandish portrayal of our beloved hero daredevil.
still have to watch... I have this amazon fetish
I wouldn t have a problem with matt murdock sleeping with she hulk let s be honest daredevil makes james bond look like a eunuch  if jennifer walters were a more interesting and well written character!
they massacred my boy
to be fair  daredevil cant really win in a fight against any hulk.
more great non-woke insight!
yea I love daredevil but without some special weapon he ain t  beating she hulk.  he s just a normal human strengh his punches etc wouldn t do anything and she could just pick him up like a doll.
jen is a terrible lawyer  she should have found out about the jet fuel before they went to trial. how was she in the da s office  she doesnt even get copyright law. matt murdock has more legal professionalism in a few scenes than jen in the entire show. was she trying to kill daredevil  tossing cars  busting the ground under him  she is not in control of her powers. the hulk does collateral damage but he is a rampaging beast. jen chooses to do this damage  she doesnt care.
that guy supposed to be a villain
I cant bring myself to watch this. I seen the  hitty cgI from the hype videos before it was available to watch and there was nothing in there that remotely got me excited. I find it hard to endure melonie s videos  its not you melonie  she hulk looks like such trash  that I cant tolerate it  however  I watch through to support melonie. I fully agree on her opinions from the little of the clips I have seen of the series. they ended up doing daredevil dirty....
frog guy said  third degree burns .the writers have no idea what this means.it means the skin is gone. muscle too  to a varying degree. burns that destroy so much tissue that often the bone is exposed.per the national institute of health   third-degree burns of the lower extremities are among the most difficult burn injuries to treat as they frequently expose bone  tendons or articular surfaces  and they usually cannot be treated with skin grafts or local flaps. so this guy shows up with bandages on both legs from knee to ankle and claims third degree burns. that much damage to his extremities and he d likely require amputation. if the legs could be saved  its years of surgeries and physical therapy.ok  its a small detail  but it could all be avoided by just not using the words  third-degree . bingo!how do I know Im a writer. when I use words  Imake sure I understand them or I do a minute of research to insure I am using words correctly. every writer should do that.
believeallhulks
ugh.  I hope that daredevil either uses a. less cgI or b. different cgi.  watching him prance around unrealistically was a bit jarring compared to the physicality and realism of the netflix series.
I blame netflix. if they brought the show back disney couldn t have gotten it.
clearly  the writers hate women as much as they hate men.
I wont be watching the whole episode. just give me the timestamp of daredevil s scenes. I ll pop in and out without a trace. the way she hulk looks on the show is ridiculous by the way. although I cant imagine how I would improve it myself.
granted leap frog  frog man are supposed to be complete idiots. and yes leap frog nd frogman are really characters and there s lore
so  jen lost most of her cases in this season and she s winning best female attorney
Im your 1000th liked.. your welcome. keep up the great work
to be clear  I didn t watch any other episodes of the show  I heard that dd was finally in this one  so I dived in. honestly  I didn t mind it  of course seeing dd again was great  but even the parts without him seemed ok. the frog guy is really dumb  the gay guy is really gay  but I think the show is just trying to make all the characters seem more goofy. I get why that would be disorienting when most mcu projects have had a more relatable approach to characters  but I think you just have to realize that the show is being satirical  idk  could be totally off base  Im sure watching the whole show would give a different perspective.with that nonsense on twitter  its pretty obvious to me that thatscene is having the cops surround she-hulk because she s turned into a rampaging hulk  and that world has seen what rampaging hulks can do. twitter is just a cesspool and youreally shouldn t put any stock into anyone s opinions on there.
mel  this is zee from the fd community. been a while.  so here is the thing. as a 40 year comic collector  this  was a solid daredevil. this suit is his original one which is cool and has history. also  the character used to be known for making jokes and quips. it was not until the 80s that he became grim and gritty.this one worked well for the mcu.leap frog he s always been a kook character and he works well here.she hulk is solid. its written like the comic. literally. she is pretty sexual also.the great thing is itshows characters outside of punching which is great in a living universe.people just like to hate on things for the sake of it. not everything is going to be for everyone anyway.
9 28 daredevil would sleep with at least 5 or 6 women in thatsame time span sometimes.
Ive criticized the cgI stunt work and Im being attacked as someone who never read comics  and its hilarious listening to people now turn on the netflix series.
she slept with 3 guys in a couple of weeks! thats just just messy!  c mon melanie  quit being naive. chicks out here be busting down 3 dudes on a weekend!
I have to disagree about the dd s suit. I was never a big fan of the yellow costume and the neflix version was almost perfect.so I really dont like dd s look here.
as good as charlie s performance was  its obvious they re just using him for views  and thats what I dont like about it. it doesnt feel like he serves any actual purpose to the show  and the only reason they brought him on was because he s popular and they needed something to keep people invested after all the backlash  much like a lot of cameos this phase . it wasn t treated like he had an actual role to play but was just a guest star appearance. not that Im asking that he do more  but my point is that it doesnt feel like they actually care about him as much as they just needed a big name. yet people are still hyping over this just because he s in it. its sad that all it takes to make people scream is to wave a familiar character in front of their faces and rehash old things they did before  sigh.
yes and no.... daredevil on this episode was the best! I only watched this one fully. matt made her open up of the idea of a real hero. what bruce was trying to say... but she didn t listen. call me crazy but the walk of shame  probably because matt didn t have any other clothes... still they could have done better.
I saw the daredevil scenes.  it was an embarrassment.  they just had to emasculate him in every way possible.  and the hallway fight was crap with all the cuts  I still remember the vastly better one-shot scenes in the netflix productions.  then  of course  the walk of shame...   just pathetic.
tattoos brains looks and Christian bugger me you are perfect x
not only could it not redeem the show  and nothing can  but it just made daredevil look like absolute shit. all of the 3 amazing daredevil seasons and even his short cameo in no way home...this show  shocker  just wrecks him.
daredevil was the only man that actually hooked up with jen instead of she-hulk. the kicker is that daredevil is blind. what does that tell you about the show runners
u rly should make a video with star wars girl. that would be fun to watch u know u two talking about she hulk last episode
which cases did she lose
she was defending the immortal guy  she lost the one that titania broke in  and she lost the case against murdock.
@bumtown1  are you serious    she had nothing to do with the immortal case and she wonthe case where titania broke in
@monky  yo  she lost the case in episode 1. she got fired for that.  remember   its the part after the car accident
@tofu topper  she wonthat case. pretty sure the boss says it too. she got fired because glk h argued that the jury was biased in her favor for saving them. her boss said she was a liability.
daredevil busts down 5 or 6 girls a week in comics.
might as well have been johnnie cochran or that chick form the amber herd trialliterllay any lawyer
@darren gordon-hill  yeah lol
@fernando martinez  the point is that only the blind man wanted jen
500  comments so this might have already been mentioned...but the bad  intelligencia  site was doing a riff on doomcock. which would be a thinly veiled reference for a lot of you folks that work the  tube in the pop-culture arena.  also matt murdock in the netflix show is a fervent catholic who struggled with a lot of stuff. he wouldn t  iirc  be doing the one night stand thing. glad Ive only caught the videos about this dreck. I ll go back to hotd now.
dont like the show but that episode was not that bad  plus  the whole matt and jen hooking up is not out of the ordinary  it was cool to see him a more light tone and still be the daredevil from netflix that ik but eyy  you might like the show  but bruh this shit is at best a 5 10  so yea the hate this shit get is wild
so they give the  walk of shame  to the one guy that defies the  toxic masculinity  trope...Im going to go out on a limb and say he definitely made the show better but not for the reasons the showrunners planned.
very refreshing take
jenn is such a terrible person she straight catfished a blind guy.  how low can she go.
seems like most people prefer content where men and women respect each other. jokes are jokes  I get that  but there s a big difference between jokes and making vindictive jabs for fun.shows that do that are  trash tv   is marvel making jersey shore now
she had no remorse for killing the guys she dropped on.
she-hulk s behavior varies on the comic writer.  I think the 90s incredible hulk and even hulk and the agents of smash did the character far better justice than this abomination of a show.
more interested in people hooking up than the actual plot of the show  oh people have been doing that forever. just look at the gundam wing fandom. but at least I d give that a pass because its mostly schoolgirl aged yaoI fangirls and not the presumed 30 something women audience thats the  target demo  for this show.
I like the red and black suit better  gold doesnt do it for me
it wasn t enough to save it because the parts with only jen after were bland af.
cant watch this yet...haven t watched  suffered through   the episode yet.
matt murdoch represents.... the stylist !!!that was all I needed to know about how much of a trainwreck this was going to be.matt is the champion of the underdog - this guy wouldn t even be on his radar.
yep this episode was just pointless  just a way for the writers to try and live vicariously through these characters. only redeeming part was how good daredevil matt murdock was  but it was not enough to make the series worth watching.
in the 19th century  twitter went by another name  asylum.
I absolutely hate the  hookup culture  that this show promotes... its killed the concept of just being friends and nothing more among many other things.
and she had a problem getting cat called
aggghh I love daredevil so much  but why does this show have to play every single character for laughs. plus a couple things throughout like how she wrecked a whole parking lot without any repercussions  plus her whole  girlboss thing with undermining daredevils plan to take the base stealthy was so annoying. the court scene was really good despite the fact it was like 5 minutes. reminded me of the daredevil shows scenes. and the ending  why would they go through all the trouble just to film her having sexual relations like  career over! its so dumb. and they hacked it like they were doing some grand scheme. Im starting to think these guys are just neck bearded internet users that pose no actual threat. what a waste. marvel fr fell off with their last two shows  and no its not because they both have female leads
I am praying that dare devil gets more seasons  its a lot better than the garbage the woke are showing us.
its a butterdevil!
guys dont have the walk of shame  we have the  stride of pride
that was a lot of fornicating for a devout catholic.
@thembanI the one  to be fair he dated elektra he must ve spent a lot of time at confession
@thembanI the one  matt is the worst catholic ever  thats the running theme of him

he represented the innocent man who made his suit. why is that an issue
oh God
embracing comedy in the mcu is worst decision they ve ever made.  we have gone from witty one liners to goofball pratfall humour and self parody.  when it gets to the point of them actually making fun of beloved characters and concepts  then why the hell should we care   why get excited about secret wars if its gonna be the superhero equivalent of abbott and costello meet frankenstein
wtf was that. daredevil did the walk of shame. he had feelings for karen and electra and never behaved this way on netflix
not even daredevil can convince me to subscribe to disney  especially since they re probably going to turn him into a wimp who will need to be saved by a woman.
at least the action scenes for daredevil were decent.  I thought they got the fight choreography and his athleticism better in this than they did for most of his own series.
daredevil has an stI now
she was nominated for best lawyer.at least this part is accurate - in feminist world women are best everything  even if they dont know anything.
can I get a shethot
when I expressed my opinion about her being doxxed at the ceremony being her fault  twitter had a fit and started harassing me. I decided to delete the app after that. I was called sexist and I apparently  slut shamed  she-hulk  a fictional character btw . apparently her sleeping with 3 guys in quick succession isn t bad according to twitter  so thats nice... I have a problem with it because jen is being painted as a victim this entire show when she has shown no redeeming qualities...she hasn t warranted any sympathy from me  and hasn t had a character arc at all. also please tell me if Im wrong for this next part  but is jen the victim when she trusted josh enough to sleep with him  sure what he did was messed up by filming her  but jen literally trusted josh within a week... a week . thats not normal. Im not justifying josh s actions  what he did was wrong  but its jen s fault for trusting every hot guy she meets and not considering the consequences  and how the dude s she meets are complete strangers who could be criminal s. remember  she is a public superpowered being  there will be people trying to kill her.
the cgI fight scene was pathetic  the editing from the cgI dd fight scene or his jump off a building to the quick cut away to charlie cox was pathetic...then have dd take the walk of shame was just fucking sad.
frogman looks like a parody of kickass.
....she sleeps with matt. he pumps and jumps  awake of shame  I lose all respect for marvel  jen get a participation trophy  outed as a sleazy  modern empowered woman   and takes a tantrum. roll credits.
didn t  the cops arrest her for going beserk
I love woke shows. instead of actually watching them  I watch people talk about how bad they are which is probably much more entertaining than the actual show. thanks for sitting through this tripe so we dont have to  d
she almost kills daredevil  then ends up screwing him. lol!!!
again someone misses the point frogman is a total joke in the comics.there s idiots in comics
to be honest daredevil was the only thing good about this episode it even made me watch the netflix series again still wasn t enough to save she hulk though
I dont get it  women writers and directors want to push woman empowerment  which is totally cool  but they always want to dangle a popular established male character to popularize and promote their female empowerment base show. they did with the lokI show  thor love and thunder movie  and now the hulk and daredevil for the she-hulk show. real women empowerment is to work hard on you skills and talent so you dont need a man to succeed. most of all needing to bring a man down to boosted yourself up cuz by definition that is what insecure bullies do. why are women activists blind to this concept   !!!
I would like to have a conversation on the matter of theology with you  melonie. if you accept  I ll give you an email address. if you are sincere in the pursuit of divinity and understanding  it would be a most wise investment of your time  as you may shortly discover. I look forward to your acceptance or regrets.
its a comedy show and its a she hulk show not the daredevil show she specifically said that with the voice over at the start of the ep.and leapfrog is a marvel comic character but u wouldnt know that bcaz u dont know sh t.
I can only speculate that all the twitter and youtube reviewers that are raving about this show are doing it for the opportunity to review shows and movies early  clout and swag. either that or they re seeing a completely different show. she hulk is by far the worst thing the mceu has produced so far.
did you actually watch the show  foggy himself told karen that matt was prone too dating an insane amount of women typically for a month or two and uses his blindness to seduce them. you can see foggy annoyed with him about it all throughout season 1. matt s body count is twice as high as jen in comics. he has countless one night stands and makes even iron man look like a virgin by comparison.
the irony of this statement
also  worst show  limp fist would like a word with you
come on man - we all know that absolutely nothing could ever redeem shit like she hulk.
weird of you to say that every man in this show is portrayed as an idiot...so daredevil is portrayed as an idiot  and her boss  and bruce warning her of these things being out of her control frogman is for the og comic book fans. he s like that on purpose.he also lied to her. he modified his costume and that was why it was defective. the fashion designer was in the right  getting defensive. because he knew his shit was good. they cant have a guy be better than a girl  ...they just did!daredevil did better than her. how did you miss that  just like shehulk  you cant do the math. shehulk didn t do her due diligence. daredevil did.she accepted that this is a lesson learned...explained and presented to her  by daredevil... which is what bruce at the beginning of this series  has been trying to get through to her.there s a daredevil show coming soon. be patient. they re working on it.this is them showing you that there will be a lead up to daredevil s show. daredevil can sense when people have a sensual attraction to him. this is consistent in both this show and netflix s daredevil. the therapy wasn t about men ghosting her. it was about  why do people like one jen and not. the other.she had a breakthrough with that and has come to terms with it now.no one said the comedy scenes have to be slaps knee! funny  doofy. the female lawyers accepting an award  was supposed to be a light joke and it was quickly brushed away. but leave it to you  to stretch that out for all its worth.in the background the internet group that got her  have been playing behind the scenes the whole time. it was in that moment she realized what was going on. its still an embarrassing moment for all of her dirty laundry to be aired. no one said it was a woman hating website in the show. that was someone s opinion on twitter. I dont know if you know this  but there s people out there who hook up with way more than 3 people a week. this is realistic television. you canthink what you want of that  but this is also realistic to daily life. if you want 7th heaven  you know you can rewatch that  right  the lesson here  is she should have kept her identity a secret. everything bruce taught her and daredevil has shown her  just came to a head here. like the world seeing her as a monster regardless if she tries to do good. thatshe s not in control of her emotions. that once her identity is out there things will get complicated and dangerous. multiple things came to fruition here.how do you miss that and equate her anger shehulk rage  to  weird grunting ...its not because she s a woman. its because she is a hulk and people are afraid of hulk s. bruce banner hulk destroyed an entire city. people are afraid of hulk s because of the rage they have witnessed and aftermath.it has to be bots that tens of thousands of people say they like it  citation  please. its rated  1 of all disney  programming right now. all those numbers are bots  citation  again  please. do you not remember the fappening...where celebrities had their nudes leaked  this is realistic to real life. and that is your example of that happening. daredevil told her   there s a difference between being a celebrity and being asuperhero  you should think about that. you contradicted yourself and I dont know if yourealize that.you said the show portrays women as perfect. so how was she a victim  people can paint her whatever way they want. most people watching the show would come to the conclusion that guns were pointed at her...because she s a hulk. not because she s a woman.just like jen  you cant do the math.
you impose your morality on jen s relationships. fine. you do you.you admit that you dont know how much time has passed then say its a couple weeks.I imagine from the announcement of the female lawyer of the year nominations to the award ceremony was longer than that. for the oscars  there are two full months between announcing the nominations and giving the awards. this is smaller  but these things still take time - the judges are reviewing court cases  arguments  legal strategies  etc.how long was she unemployed  a day  a week  a few months  we dont know.every one of jen s 4 dates from the dating app could have been a week or two apart. or all 4 on the same night. we dont know.between doctor sex and josh sex could have been days  weeks  or months. we dont know.this show could have spanned just a few weeks or maybe many months.we dont know.even so  3 guys in a few weeks time isn t  nasty . or  maybe it is to you  but not to everybody.also  some james bond movies  james has 3 women in a period spanning just a few days. is that nasty  most people would say  james bond is a ladies man. a stud. a player.  few would call it  nasty . so why is a female hero having sex a few times in a few weeks  or more  so  nasty  when a male hero having sex a few times in a few days is somehow praiseworthy you called jen a  ho  in this video. your words. if you knew that daredevil banged two women in nyc in the last month of so  would you now call him a  nasty   ho  too maybe the message here is to stop treating women with double standards. ironically  you mention double standards in this video but ignored this double standard because you  apparently  are ok with this one. or maybe not. maybe you would be equally disturbed if matt murdock was equally as promiscuous as jen. please let me know  I ll correct this if you do.I found the problem. you said  people shipping sex in superhero shows is weird and gross.  your words.I dont know why you think sex is weird or gross. Im sorry you feel that way.apparently jen and matt think sex is fun.you do you. if you want to keep thinking sex is weird and gross  go for it.but maybe let jena and matt think what they want without passing judgment on them based on your standards rather than theirs.I ll say one thing  their way seems more rewarding. ymmv.
this show is terrible  but I cant stop watching it. the people who slow down on the road to look at a car crash  thats me and this show. honestly  it could have been really good if they had just hired competent writers. I think the actress is pretty decent.
1  thats what frogman is. kind of an idiot. 2  what else could they do for the case win  that was the thing wrong with his suit.3  of course she would wear her suitshe doesnt want to be a hero. 4  she super claps  he goes off audio. he d be stunned enough for her to get him on the floor.5  watch the netflix show then6  she didn t  know better  she didn t want to sit there while he did everything.7  she hulk and matt in the comics are both  hey let s skip that and hook up 8  yeah she would because thats realistic. going to a female lawyer award show would have someone say that.9  a mockery  dd makes quips  dd hooks up often. you made some good points  but I cant agree with it.
frog man was always a joke tho
daredevil is such a cool character.its sad this generation has forgotten about cool superhero stories and storylines. Im so sick of woke feminist crap.
I actually dont have any issues with her beating him. martial arts and enhanced senses are not invincible and being a hulk pretty much is. you will mostly always have to run away from a hulk. he did finesse around her until she shockwaved him too. writing is still shit though
I d do the walk of shame too if I ever featured on she-hulk knowing its such a terrible show.
you know a show sucks when they have a character that is a cartoon version of a cartoon character  .not mention     she lost a court case to matt murdock because she is a awful lawyer  .she is a typical sjw    sticking up for and protecting criminals  .I cant believe that I am actually going say this     but she gives lawyers a bad name  .
I ll just stick with netflix daredevil.
to the actor that plays daredevil . . . there is not enough bleach in all creation to cleanse your soul! I hope the money  and promise of your  own  show  was worth it.
this show is gonna go down in history as one of the worst  if not the worst things that the mcu has ever produced.
14 24 lmao!!!!
every guy isn t a jerk. look at the support group headed up by abomination. they re kind of funny and have issues but they dont fall into your obviously political statement.  jens boss isn t a jerk  he s a boss. the judges aren t buffoons or jerks. howabout the lawyers
I liked this episode mainly because of daredevil but I did think she was better with him. the actress isn t the problem. I do think they will botch the finale. we are getting a jen walter s red she hulk .. let the period jokes flow  .. pun intended   I hope at least we get the leader but Im scared its just the super hero fanboys out smarting who is and should be smart. like this show is meant to empower her by being sex positive but they made her stupid  . these writers suck
nice to see how the  writers  portray black men specifically along with their misandrist views towards all men in general. cringe.
its nice to hear a woman s take on the show based on objectivity and logic. I see lots of male youtubers calling out the show  understandably  but I wanted to hear what women  actual women who aren t brainwashed by the cult of woke  thought about the show. subscribed.
I dunno I liked she hulk but im also into 12 foot tall green women who would give me death by snu snu lol
its like these women have never heard of women s suffrage. women have had equal rights and equal protection under the law for over 100 years. where women faced real problems not these made up problems.women of today serve in every career field men do including the military which historically was one field they were expressly prohibited from. women of today also are viewed more favorably in the judicial system when it comes to cases like child support custody  divorce alimony  and even recieve lighter punishments than men do for committing the same crime. women of today have everything that the women of 100 years ago wanted and fought hard for and these left wing feminist wine moms think they just sat on their asses and did nothing.they re acting like women are second class citizens in reality and thatshe-hulk was somehow smashing the patriarchy and forcing people to witness the  problems  women are going through everyday is ridiculous.this show has a plethora of problems   the clear mysandry  for those who dont know its the opposite of misogyny   the bad writing  and the cheesiness of it all  but the worst has to be its die hard fans defending this garbage!she-hulk wasn t arrested for defending her own honor. she was arrested for going on a violent hulk like rampage and the city and the police know what her cousin did and wanted to prevent that in the future.seeing daredevil was awesome though so ill give it that. I disliked the gold parts of his suit but Im at least glad that he wasn t totally demasculated and humiliated.
holy shit! an actual intelligent breakdown correcting her .and she didn t give you a heart .funny that
@brenda spence  haha im not holding my breath  she s been wrong about every episode so far and keeps pushing a man hating narrative ...but birds of prey!
3 guys in a few weeks time isn t  nasty  how desperate are you   what if your wife said that to you  do you wear underwear other gave used  why not  they washed it  right
maybe let jena nd matt think what they want they are fictional charcters  weirdo!!!they do as they are written!!!you are so blindyet another case of defending this show proving funnier than the show
all the mcu before she-hulk has had less sex scenes than she hulk  and its just one woman
@darren gordon-hill  and yet here we are talking about those fictional characters.and melonie is making a whole video about them and passing judgment on the behavior of those fictional characters.and Im offering a counterpoint judgment  or willingness to withhold judgment  on that behavior of those fictional characters. and youre attacking me about my lack of judgment on the behavior of those fictional characters.every one of us knows they are fictional.why are you even here watching a youtuber criticize fictional characters or maybe melonie s comment  and my reaction to her comment  weren t about fictional characters but about behaviors and how some people pass judgment on those behaviors.but I guess subtleties like that might be too hard to grasp by the kind of mind who attacks people on the internet over the behavior of fictional characters.in case that was also too subtle  I  meant you  darren gordon-hill.
@fernando martinez  exactly
yeah agreed. in terms of raw strength he couldn t possibly beat her. he could potentially  however  use his martial prowess to get a slight upper hand in some specific scenarios  because she s just brute force while he s actually got skills.
@david conway jr.  he still ain t getting a strike thats gonna make her flinch hell iron fist stands a better chance
@david conway jr.  just no... it would look like deadpool vs colossus scene with a little less bones breaking. they could definitely have extended the fight but daredevil would be on perpetual defense until either losing or getting a break to get away. you cant armlock a person who can always break free by lifting or breaking your body.
the entertainment industry is obsessed with feminizing black men lately  it feels beyond deliberate at this point
madysinn is the hulk king
so much for controlling her anger  infinitely better  than bruce huh   why would she be getting a lawyer award  hasn t she actually lost every case she was the attorney on   at least they managed to sneak in that the sokovia accords have been repealed. that might have been the most interesting thing in this episode.
if she-hulk was a competent  female lawyer of the year -worthy lawyer  she should have found out if leapfrog had used the boots according to the instructions before taking the case to court. super basic stuff!
question  shulk beats ddevil in this encounter.. so just talking about the context of this one instance - at this point in time how long has he being doing what he is doing vs she being hulk   strength alone wouldnt beat him if he has more experience .. and she would automatically have new knowledge of her new self - which was indicated when she was with bruce and he was trying to help her -.. but of course she  magically  could do everything already .. so .. question withdrawn.  just a horrible horrible show from the writer! wont blame the actor....  but one might      but the writer is just...     !!!
you made some great points! totally agree!only people who would defend this are the   woke  generation!the show was a total train wreck. daredevil was also very marvelized ! shame
gave up on society. dropped all my friends   became a recluse so now its just work  sleep  video games    cycling. the world s problems are no longer mine
at this stage  Im just completely gobsmacked that rational people haven t given up on all western  entertainment . its just pure man-hate  and so badly written and performed. again  kudos to you guys who sit through this miserable crap so we dont have to!
to me  episode 8 of she-hulk is something that is very relevant in todays society  and I believe is an actually really good representation of the concept of hookup sex  and the implications of it if known to your peers. it is well-known that  culturally  women are held up to a higher standard than men when it comes to sex and how much they acquire. men can have just as much   and not a single person bats an eyelid. that is just a fact. but why is that  calling someone a  slut  is the most easiest and best way to remove any predetermined judgement a person has towards you  as it presents a negative connotation in your brain - removing all layers a person has to their being  i.e. are funny  smart  loyal etc. having sex  whether that be a lot  or very little is a small part of a persons life. hence the term  sex life . sex is a very intimate thing  that is why when it is exposed to others  it has a very negative impact on you as a person  along with the people who know about it.in this case  jennifer has never denied thatshe enjoys sex  its quite evident thatshe enjoys it  and uses men to fulfil her need. the big difference this time around is that because jennifer is a woman - it is a great tactic to use against her  as the media do on say female celebrities like taylor swift. if you date too much  youre a  slut . if you write songs about your relationships youre  emotional . if a man were to do the exact same thing people would say thats a good song  oh damn the lyrics relate to me. everyone writes songs about their love life  but young woman in particular get penalised for it. that also is a fact. this episode demonstrated that instead of gathering criminal evidence against jennifer  the most affective way to destroy her representation is the release her  dirt  to the world. and it worked. they humiliated her at the peak of her career  whilst simultaneously catching her reaction  which in turn created a domino effect of more negative publicity. it was a simple  but affective way for the show to demonstrate how easily it is to take a public figure  and destroy them - as we see more and more each day through social media. unfortunately  the show uses this to provide further negativity against men  and how they treat woman. they took something jennifer enjoyed  used that as her weakness  to completely destroy her. now they will be a negative consequence every time jennifer wants to have sex with another person - as this event will be a point in time that will affect her relation with others forever.
gala dress  sweet merciful Jesus give me the mental fortitude to carry on.
this is probably the lamest villain motive Ive ever seen in this ep.
is melonie taken  cause I wouldn t mind taking her out for a drink
also I imagine they let matt win because his client was a sassy black gay man whereas she was representing a straight white man.
if you dont like she-hulk why do you continue to watch it every week if I tried mountain dew for the first time and hated it  I wouldn t keep drinking it.
are they making fun of kick-ass
you are such a  pick me  girl lmao
once again  she hulk was improved with the cameo  this being charlie cox s daredevil. like this was the most action Ive seen in this show and it was one of the better episodes but what on earth did they do to his costume  why shove him into a one night stand relationship with jennifer walters  and seriously    the whole female lawyer of the year awards banquet giving almost every woman lawyer an award .really    you couldn t have narrowed it down to one deserving lawyer. this is like giving every kid on the baseball team a participation award for doing absolutely nothing ..
didn t like dd s outfit at all.  it was just a poor design choice  like they got the wrong pieces from the costume people and  just didn t want to take time to color it properly.
props to you for watching this crap . Ive canceled my sub to them and judging by this vid I doubt I ll change that anytime soon.
1 had to have daredevil do the walk of shame. couldn t let the almighty she hulk doing it.   2 its funny that daredevil smashed she hulk most of the show it was she ho.... so empowering. she hulk smash the patriarchy
sounds like this was better done in the movie mannequin with the white guy s black friend who did the window dressing. I think that black guy was named hollywood. been a while since I watched mannequin.
which cases did she lose
what case did she lose
I dont know why these female writers would think a man would ever be ashamed of getting some.
ooh look at me controlling my rage and emotions
this series has been shameful. I have two daughters  8 and 5  who Ive gotten into comics and superhero s. naturally they wanted to watch this series but its extremely difficult because the entire series is like a soft porn hbo film. there s zero effort to really establish the character of she hulk and 100  energy put into her sex life. like  wtf marvel! !
I think the show runners just want to live in a  perfect  world without men lol. which makes me feel really bad for them. like what a hole did this and scarred these poor show runners
this is my favorite channel to watch between ladies pole vaulting.
why does disney try to make these shows like disney channel like that doesnt make any sense if they wanted it to be successful they should try something different and interesting with the source material follow the source material I know they didn t but Im just saying it might help if they did especially for the daredevil disney plus show because this does not give me much hope
they even butchered frog man.
destroying a wall of tv screens etc self defence setting a man on fire as he sleeps self defence and award from pm s wife
she beats him because she a hulk
the one question I had on my minde watching the end like this is a party ok but why is there a huge ass screen on stage like did they plann to put clips from curt or what it made scens like the rest of the show was bad but like why every thing hase to be cented around her beeing an angel and evryone els is bad
daredevil didn t save the show even his scenes were wonky.
why was he carrying his shoes walking bare foot they aren t heels.
was tv attacking she-hulk for her to  defend  herself
lol melonie I couldnt help to look help to see if the one dude in the beginning was samI zayne  pro wrestler
afaik has the frog always been clumsy and a problem especially for peter parker.
this girl looks so much like pokemane but better lol. she loter makes the actual pokemane look like the walmart pokemane
I hope they leave the punisher alone and dont fuck that up as well
sounds like you owe mom an apology
wtf  really  they made them hook up im not even checking this episode.
hoelk  exposed . disney makes a youtuber the villan . lol doomcock
probably best not to put too much thought into it.
@john durham  I was just mocking of ppl saying she  defended herself hence why she got mad  whatever happened to  I can control my anger infinitely better than you
@ashura  I was just worried you were taking this show seriously
@john durham  well all the trope about women thatshe-hulk was saying its all about the men and not both sexes do it.
@ashura  you are truly a wise person.
@john durham  I call it as it. dont pretend because as if both cant do it.
sup she-dunkwhy have you banned the cuddly cuties
to be clear  I dont like she hulk on this show. but daredevil made jen wake up!. if daredevil is out  not gonna watch the next ep  but hey it was good that one
did you say  vagarring
I think they are bots or are the one s paying for the bots because out of know where all this accounts saying its  so reliable   then all at once stop talking about it.
even though it happens in the comics I hate matt slept with her but she hulk sleeping around is a thing she does so meh I ll Ive it a pass
of course she gonna beat daredevil she s a hulk yes daredevil a bad ass but still a regular guy
so realistic  right cause they didn t point their guns at her because she s a hulk who punched a wall causing parts of the ceiling to fall on her own parents  friends  and others in that building only to bust through a wall to grab a guy by the neck with no legal evidence  even if its obvious . no its cause she was  defending herself  after hooking up for three weeks and getting exposed for it. sure totally realistic. realistically delusional.
who on earth would vote any so called lawyer as bad as jen  lawyer of the year
twitter might be 80  bots. its an advertising and marketing campaign.
kirkland amy winehouse doesnt like the show. clutch the pearls.
why does intelligencia hate jen so much  were they forced to have to watch this show  if not  then why does abomination  uh Imean intelligencia want to destroy her  shouldn t its time be better spent at literally anything else  she s a minor character whose only had one public battle  and that was in the court and was over in 2 seconds  as the stupid rematch at the wedding wasn t national news. the whole premise of the show makes no sense  and the freaking finale is next week!this is what happens when characters arent fleshed out. the only character that is at all fleshed out is jen  and its not in a positive light. she is a missandrist  is toxic  shallow  slutty  selfish  narcissistic  vain  lacks empathy  lacks humility  and is extremely self centered. but since we the viewers are the only ones privy to all that  it makes no sense why everyone else  like imtelligencia  titania  josh  basically every male character treat her so badly. I hope the writers of this show either study immensely or never work in hollywood again  as we viewers deserve so so much better then this slop we re being fed! the only enjoyment I get from it  is hearing youtubers like you rip it to shreads. itshould be taught in writing classes on everything not to do while creating stories and characters.
special antI she hulk unit was there in like 5 min.  and nobody grabs the guy in the mask at the end  so dumb
we re watching through the lens of these lonely 30-something-year-old childless chopsticks cheetos eating female she-hulk writers.
nothing attracts a guy to commit to a woman more than her sleeping with the guy asap.
damn she cute
by doing the walk of shame   nope.
with all due respect mel  you are so fine
no in fact it made she-hulk worse.
why did he hold his combat boots like high heels and walk out in the day light I get the walk of shame joke they were trying to go for but its really dumb poorly done
I dont want to point out the obvious but you are also an attractive young woman
thank you
melonie has more testosterone than any man in this tv show xd
wait dare devil operate at night so this walk of shame day time  in costume makes no since
11 58 notice how this person conflates their own subjective morality with objective legality.
women aren t physically weaker when the guy wont hit back.
canthis show just get to the point where its like bros  accepted as an embarrassment   loses money for disney so they get their head out of their ahem and then they sell the rights to someone who will make something actually good
madness
people who ship characters and loose my mind when they do sexual shit is so cringe go outside and meet someone
its so funny how the coolest thing they have on this show is a man hahahahahahahahaha
go boom
bru name is frog man nd got jet boots to fly.... now Im not the brightest bulb but frogs dont fly
the few good actors on this turkey sd be ashamed of themselves. I wd be willing to watch  for  1000 an episode  maybe.
they completed degraded daredevil
that daredevil episode was awesome  now the other episodes were  !
I was excited to watch this show  couple of episodes in  im not excited anymore. ok   I know they re going to have daredevil in the show. maybe it wont be as bad.....even having daredevil  the show still sucked. they did a good job with daredevil.
she-hulk defeats daredevil  unmasks him  sleeps with him.btw  in the new werewolf by night  the two males are joke characters  and the female lead is all-powerful  unbeatable.
you have never read a she hulk comic have you
what the actual fuckdaredevil deserves so much better.
okay  melonie...we get it! you love men we love you too  now chill!!
I knew it of course she-hulk beats daredevil classic m-she-u God I hate this show good video melonie keep it up
I thought it was funny that these officers with high powered guns just happen to show up immediately after she hulks out.  so dumb.  daredevil was the only good part of this episode
sadly true
I think its because they hooked up and he didn t have a change of clothes  so he had to walk back in his daredevil costume  but he doesnt even try to hide. it doesnt make any logical sense for him to do something like that  even if he doesnt have a change of clothes.
@fernando martinez  that has nothing to do with anything  except in your mind.also  superhero comics weren t sex comics till they started getting morphed into alternative relationship dramas instead of action   adventure.
she-hulk should beat daredevil. she has super strength.
@jermare  that doesnt matter she literally has no combat experience compared to daredevil who is a highly experienced fighter
@jermare  so did kingpin and daredevil end up beating him plus daredevil is a trained martial artist acrobatic not sure he s got radar sense didn t he have that in the netfix series let me know
@virgil hawkins   .she is a hulk  are you seriously comparing kingpin ..and a ducking hulk ! ! lol ok
@sockmonkey gaming  it literally does.she is a hulk.he is a human ninja.no ouch or kick is hurting herhell iron fist is a better match for her
I just watched the episode yesterday daredevil badassery got toned down from a 15 to a three and Im like what the hell is this crap. he cantake out all eight guys in a little hallway scene he did not need she-hulk to save him  just remember everyone she hulk is not a superhero she does all of her supposed helping out in the law firm only and she s even bad at that too. the episode is now acting like she is always known the superhero gig which is wrong very very wrong and its pathetic these writers are pathetic the showrunner is pathetic  plus I did not understand why daredevil would encourage her to be a superhero when she isn t a superhero.
what daredevil hookup with her. that make no sense.
promiscuous men - badpromiscuous women - yasss slay queen!this is the hypocrisy of it all
but we can say daredevil was the only thing cool about the show
whoa spoiler alert!
she hulk made dasredevil dirty...........way to ruin him disney
soy-devil doing the walk of shame was just sad.
8 38 pronouns in the bio lmoa
I have mixed emotions on this episode.  daredevil was fantastic till the completely unnecessary hookup scene.  but she hulk is still nauseating.
shreks and the city.  -
the writers and creators of she hulk have ruined this show.
melanie fye
the cgI is so bad with daredevil. omg
wow that cgI is terrible
I guess I d also be offended if I originally followed or cared about original she hulk to begin w..honestly wongers and this episode are only 2 worth watching
kind of ironic how big stronk she-hulk gets away with destroying parking lots and stuff without any consequences whatsoever.  bad lawyer  bad.
this ass not gettin  whooped today
double hockey stick hell no
so she s a hero   how much property damage does she cause . who sues her
wow you and kat the hijabI gamer are almost alike
but she beating dd makes a lot of sense  how could he beat an indestructible being. this show is boring and really garbage  but idk  it just makes sense  not pushing any propaganda. btw  I think the cgI on some scenes were really good  at least in 1 episode it felt like a 6 10 episode. and that ending
normalizing hookup culture is depraved and repulsive.and  unfortunately  keeps gaining speed.  its destroying the concept of healthy   real relationships.
this women is trying very hard to find the most little things to hate on this show
in reality there is lauded man-hating  and women-hating is met with the full force of cancel mobs.
leapfrog was ridiculously stupid and incompetent....they got him right surprisingly...but I am with you....the show has been a dumpster fire.  people watch marvel for the super heroes  not the kardashian-esque drama crap  there s drama real life shows already.....marvel fans watch marvel to get away from that ish.    after 5  episodes of filler crap.....we finally got a good character again  daredevil was on point  as we knew he would be after the netflix show being as good as it was.  they d have been better off with daredevil being in it earlier  and him teaching her to balance the lawyer and hero instead of a quick statement about it and thats it.   - also they keep painting her as horribly thirsty  but alllll the guys are terrible....cept daredevil.  it is annoying af disney.
they are doing daredevil dirty  my hopes for born again are already in the trash  for fucks sake!
it was such a miss representation of matt murdock. disney is turning daredevil into a soy boy. I was excited to see matt murdock appear in  no way home  but this is such a disappointment.
gaslighting does not mean saying something that you dont agree with.
like wtf was this episode...the villain has goons and a warehouse for no reason...kidnaps edna mode to force him to make a costume...and this is such a threat that they need daredevil for this  like the only reason they had daredevil was to make the fight scene look cool but the frog guy did not need 20 goons..and his silly suit didn t work the first time so like wtf was the purpose of the need for the suit  like why is a edna guy making super hero suits for just anybody..why does matt need to go all the way to california for a suit he ll only wear once....
I couldn t get passed the third episode. stopped watching the show altogether. Im a girl and I have a girlfriend. but I also have three older brothers. and I hate these types of male bashing shows. you can have a strong female character without having to rely on hating men each and every frickin five to ten minutes. rather watch agents of smash where she hulk is portrayed a billion times better.
she-hulk... a show that could ve been great   should ve been great but was just terrible.
she hulks greatest villian is not titania  not the leader  not red she hulk. its the internet trolls
definitely not haha
no. cuz its a she hulk shownot a dare devil show
its a good thing he doesnt have super smell!
I agree with you. this show is overall horrible
30 seconds in the video and you called him  frog man . no no no no no no. I hate the fake fans and people who dont even do research so much
they made dd loom ridiculous in thatshow
intelligencia is doomcock! haha  they thirsty..
she seems based
no  he wasn t
chyna made a better she-hulk.
nope. they ve ruined that character completely. as soon as they ended the series on netflix  I knew it was going to take a turn for the worst.
the daredevil scenes are the only good thing about this show.
daredevil is one of my favorite tv shows. if he cant get me to watch this trash  nothing will.
wheres your accent from
I swear  these marvel people are just tryna rip off better call saul and cash grab off it - dont let them!
no. this show is essentially a scripted dating show.
that looks like a kick--ass wannabe.
I cant see how you can watch this. disney always takes the most lazy path when developing a character. john wick is one of the most op ed male characters but always look like he is constantly on deaths door.
best female lawyer ... ! this show is a gold mine of
if you cant speak on the comics then your definitely not gonna get the real of why the show really sucked! and dare devil has zero chance of beating she-hulk in a fight  what is he going to do to stop her  just stop and think just a little bit  please
cant really comment on the show itself because Ive not seen any of it .. but.one of the big disapointments for me with the clips I have seen is she barely looks any better than the old tv series hulk  like they just slapped some green paint on  its jarring to go back to something as basic as that after the mcu hulk.it just looks bad and really crappy.
I came in like a butterball! lol sorry just put this pic up  p is it me or woman without their makeup hotter then with makeup  just sayin
Im sorry no new super hero can out due expericed hulk  or beat  out due a experienced daredevil female or not
and loll not mad matt slept with jen. not she hulk coz that... wouldn t been good.
daredevil was only there to bring in viewers. she hulk as a show is bad.
watched the episode expecting to be disappointed but was actually a good episode youre just hating for the sake of hating for views at this point instead if genuine review
no  but it did give good amount of hope  for his upcoming show !!!
wow the cgI is distractingly bad
this version of daredevil looks so cheesy  the cgI is crap.....Im sticking to the original netflix version of daredevil...matter of fact  Im going to binge watch it now.
nope 2022
crystal dynamics is having a survey for a new legacy of kain gameplease use it.please. show them we care because one of the questions is remastered reboot or sequeland it also asks things to inform the teamplease help  maybe we can get amy hennig back.who knos.its 20 years sincewe got a game please participate. I would love a new game and all the va despite some being dead now  lets finish the story...fans have been beggingfor yearsthis is now your chance to tell crystal dynamicsexactly what you wantvae victis
this whole series has done a huge disservice to she-hulk character and women and I say this as a guy
the walk of shame gag did not hit as intended
screw she hulk.what I wanna know is......what s this girl got against sleaves never wears em.
the cgI is God awful
I lost count
jessica gao has to go!! msheu has to end!! absolutely disgusting and disgraceful television.
not read the comics then.  the hook ups are all over the place in she hulk comics as well as in dardevil ones.  as for property damage er  shes a hulk.... and no she doesnt try to kill him at all
this show is an absolute disaster  and they ve ruined daredevil in this episode! they re going to doing it much worse in the daredevil disney  revival!
the women that plays  she hulk was good actress   but  disney just turned her into a puppet  .  come here puppet  yes I know u want to o way lets go woke puppet  yes master . I will obey  lets do woke   weak story  I will obey master disney  . pathetic . like really what the hell is going on same as amazon with rings of power . like come on really  . do we all have to  fight in real in person
the episode wasn t funny at all. wasn t the worst though  cause daredevil was cool and more professional than her in every sense. my problem is jennifer is way too thirsty!
I will admit the show is bad and to think it was suppose to be out before moon knight but the studio made them reshoot some episodes
the tweet about a woman defending herself makes no sense to me. because to add to the whole cops siding with the woman thing more woman get away with domestic violence simply because they are women. there is no reality where this isn t the case. she-hulk wasn t even being threatened because she s a woman. she s a six foot seven rage monster that just ripped apart a giant flat screen and then proceeded to crash through a wall like the freakin koolaid man. every single person was running for their lives because they thought they were next. she merely had guns pointed at her. if bruce had lost control like that they would ve opened fire on him immediately.
one somewhat decent episode cant help this show its still awful
wish I gave a shyte.
3 guys in 2 months
11 07 well thats because they re bots or people they hired to praise movies etc.m if the actual public reviews say that the movies etc sucked.
if she can have opinion so can you dont make this woman feel like your crazy for liking it the show if you liked itsay it loud and proud and also they never said being  shut is good thing where get that idea from that what Im talking about just say false things about a show is stupid to me.
or .people like the show
@brenda spence  I guess the actual public review data just goes over your head and you believe you and the few that does enjoy the show are the whole universe.
this fight scene between the two of them was pathetic  daredevil does look cool but his costume is garbage they could have done a better job with his costume and the fight scene daredevil doesnt run from any fight.
she hulk is a great show tbh
no it was not actually I have no idea  I have no desire to watch that trash.since you brought up daredevil  though  Imight o back   rewatch season one of thatshow.
so...not only are they making matt murdock an idiot by not even trying to conceal his abilities and identity  but then they triple down now on she hulk being the village bicycle !  what message are these writers trying to send  that hitting on women is bad  but also will get you laid  all you have to do is have a  maybe  2 hour conversation  oh  and be hot. be muscular  or rich  or well kempt or a bad boy. the fuck what is this shit  itscreams against objectification  then shows in scenes that  not only is it valid  but it works. and isn t jen supposed to be a lawyer and better than her cousin  why is she destroying private property while aiding and failing to report a vigilante! ! also  I love that the two cases that we see matt murdock taking on  that I know of  is being a legal counsel for parker and his friends  and this dumbass frogman. he s being a lawyer for super hero cases instead of high risk criminal cases involving death  extortion  or blackmail. in other words he s doing the casework jen should be doing. they have it reversed! daredevil is the batman of marvel. why is he so pedestrian now  why is she hulk so selfish now  why is the hulk so passive now  why is dr. strange so idiotic now  why is everything wrong! ! only spider man is in a situation that fits him and will lead him to grow. what is happening at disney  why such a massive sea change  almost everyone can see how terrible these shows are. anyone can write and direct these shows better. why these people
its a shame. that women want to men so bad  at the same time man bashing at every chance they get. men cant do the  walk of shame  no man is shame after having sex. those who think dd should have been a shame of sleeping with jen  then thatsays more about what you think of jen than dd. stud shaming is not a thing.....lol
matt would no do her.....
man  that cg is bad!
damn this show portrays women in a very bad light.
nothe answer is..no
daredevil was neither a jerk or moron
you dont like the show  we get itso why watch it
for fuck sake.....of everyone daredevil is supposed to have some class
mustard and ketchup daredevil didn t add much flavor to this beyond boring she-hulk burger.
holy crap the cgI is bad.  neo fighting agent smith 20 years ago was better.
does no one care about matt s relationship with karen
that cg looks so fake.
did they forget about karen and matt  this show is awful!!
ah  no
great vid..... thatshow is terrible and I refuse to watch one episode of it
rotten tomato gives this trash an 87  critics score  but it has no critics reviews. the audience score of 35  is loaded with reviews  good   bad . very odd.
he absolutely would lol dude is a horn dog even in comics
I never said he was  I was talking about how they portrayed the other men in the show
hopefully she and foggy come back in the new daredevil series  but for all we know its just going to be charlie cox as matt with an otherwise fully new cast.
agreed if I was charlie cox  I would of ask them to have him not get in a relationship with she hulk. that part was the dumb also.
@david conway jr.  l
yes.
I knew dude would he gay and I didt even watch the episode just seen the picture sigh
I dont like the yellow suit. didn t likenitbin the comics  and dont like it now. it makes no sense for him to wear yellow.
in my view daredevil did not save the show the show still garbage was supposed to make daredevil a badass and they only made him again I say from a 15 badassery down to a 3 which is garbage.
the dialogue was pain and they made matt dumb
I knew they d use him for sex before this ep was available but  remember when he used to have principles about this kind of thing   I hear thatstopped within his own show  but what a bummer
hell no
is she seriously complaining about daredevil losing to she hulk
the answer is no
she hulk was utter garbage with its pandering and agenda they had from episode 1 onwards  thats why the viewings of this is worse than any other marvel show ever. but now that the daredevil cameo that everyone was waiting for in the first place has come and gone the show will go back to being trash again  but hey hope all the twitter boys enjoyed it tho.
you and anna tswg  got this review down to a tee. still glad I didn t watch this.
the super suitstylist looks like a gay character thatshould be on the proud family.  which I hope they do not do.
Im sorry  but Ive got the biggest crush on you... God  I cant even watch your videos
sorry but griffin matthews  the gay guy  is like that in a bunch of his roles. the man just has sass. sass for days  sass for days.
maybe just a bra next time this is a grift  she s not selling her opinions  she s selling her ....
lol
the frog guy looks like a discount kick-ass  and the black gay man looks like a key   peele skit. the writers have no originality.
nope  cant polish a turd.
I thought maybe this should would be entertaining to kids b c so silly   slapstick but first 2 minutes she hulk used words that I dont like   kids aren t allowed to use.      and then much more downhill from there. not for kids.
just to add insult to injury... comic books intelligentia is a team made out of the most dangerous and smartes super-criminals on earth that  in their first incarnation  almost caused a gamma-apocalypse by hulking many superheroes and setting them on a rampage in washington dc... here  a bunch of incels leaking a she-hulk s x-tape...this show is repulsive on so many levels its staggering.
nope.
youre ridiculous he s absolutely a ladies man in the comics too
dude .daredevil has a body count in comics
this show is an abomination! they completely destroyed dd and thatsuit is trash  .f disney for destroying characters they will never understand
overwhelmingly negative reception on yt yet you go to rotten tomatoes and the show is featured at the top of the page for best tv and streaming series of 2022. why the blatant fucking discrepancy  wtf is going on mel
what happened to the Bible verses
it was great seeing real superhero stuff... but I didn t like the comedy moments with daredevil  we dont need another deadpool  spiderman or fat thor!  and why is she-hulk having sex with everyone on the show   this hook up culture is crazy.... they need to do a trojan s commercial!if captain america had banged 3 different women in 6 weeks people would have lost their mind  but for a woman character it is looked at as normal!!!! crazy....
more crybabies hating lol  this daredevil is comic accurate
probably not  but then again no one cares if marvel shows are good as long as there are member berries and nostalgia jiggles. so fuck it.
continue  they already ruined her outfit by leaking the action figures of her outfit way before the episode aired weeks earlier so no surprises there .
oh no  not even if the averagers came out in it  even if they brought tony stark back itstill wouldn t help  because the writers would just fuck that up too
was I the only one who didn t enjoy the daredevil fight choreography
daredevil is ruined fivever.
nope
frog man amazing but actually not she hulk is competing for the stupid show ever but hey lets keep pretending we like it.
sorry had to skin threw all this bullshit! 10 15 its all bullshit and fucking daredevil from disney plus will have a laugh track.
no
it wouldn t matter if they had literal Jesus Christ in the show... its a horrible show in general...
its impressive how you misrepresent everything happening in this show to fit this weird narrative to cultivate hate  but then proceed to call others delusional who like the show. on top of that you genuinely dont understand anything about these characters you try to complain about  thatshit is lame and disingenuous. you are not a fan
this show  is a mess. Imean  last I checked  filming sex without consent is illegal. posting it for others to see violates all kinds of other laws especially in california. so  this is dark and ugly comedy and completely erodes the tone of the show. how is this considered a sitcom
this writer has a very immoral view on relationships and doesnt know how to write about heroes at all.
why ask a dumb question  its literally impossible to  be the only one
intelligencia is a spoof of a youtube reviewer  dr doomcock  check it. its terrible
im kind of disappointed in your content here. itseems to me that you rush to judgment for the sake of making or rushing content. its not well-thought of
you have to go over the top with the gays  otherwise how do you get diversity points
is it a stretch to say that this is the worst show in the mcu
there goes mcu 4 destroying more iconic characters to push agendas that tend to create a backlash
he won because blindness   female and black probably gay client trumps white dude. I dont care cause Im not watching the show
nope. no chance. more wasted time with only slightly less awful writing.
this plot sounds stupid.Im glad I dont watch any of this dumb crap.
my opinion of daredevil has fallen.  what terrible taste in women!  even worse  he has some sort of weird bad-cgI fetish.  I d rather he was a furry.
so they completely ruined dare devil  great
of course not its trash
the cgI is so ridiculously awful.
as much as im disliking the show  I have to say. if you think there s a universe where daredevil beats a fucking hulk in combat you are on some good drugs
hot garbage
that walk of shame bit was so stupid.
regarding the hallway scene...what are you talking about lol  she interfered and demonstrated she s not a team player...because if youre invulnerable youre probably not really into people helping you. it had nothing to do with her plan. they were demonstrating thatshe s not a superhero and doesnt know how to be one. she s all brawn and no strategy which humanizes her. in closing she wasn t saving him because he had it handled. this is a comedy show and this was the twist or punchline. youre too biased to conduct a fair analysis. and I know this series has not been the best. but this episode was awesome.....except for the walk of shame. that was dumb.
cant wait for this show to get cancelled . if they a good she hulk show to work then cancel the recent show   fire all the misandrist woke women   hire men that are loyal and respectful fans and do not allow any wokeness. its the only way that it can work .
its so apparent you have no idea about she-hulk because you haven t read any comic. also the show is a comedy. every person is a exaggeration. there is strong positive male men in this show.pug wongbruceemil. it goes to show you are just like the villains in the show calling the character a ho. let me remind you there have been celebs that experienced the same thing pam andersonparis hiltonkim kardashianyou can have an opinion but be a little smarter.
probably.  just a filler show . it is not point to it
yea its not happening. even if she doesnt know how to fight she s way to strong for him. he s just a normal strength dude
@daniel n  yup also a hulks healing factor is to op but idk what hers is like cause hulks gets better with rage
I dont get how revenge porn is funny in a quirky and fun comedy. your association of comedy with victims of revenge porn shows the kind of character youreally are.
@ominousflare  clearly not what they were saying but im not surprised given your other comments
