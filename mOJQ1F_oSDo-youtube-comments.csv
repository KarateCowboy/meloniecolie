changing for modern audiences  is the phrase that lets me know to avoid the game
modern audiences  is a misnomer. the audience hasn t changed. its catering to the tone deaf toxicity of  modern corporate culture . thats what its for. not us. its for their own shallow  broken selves.
appealing to modern day audiences.  so samantha fisher will take selfies and post them on social media  complain a lot  and have his feelings easily hurt because its a cruel world we live in  sounds like the type of tactical espionage game I d like to play.
10 years ago  I would ve laughed at the prospect of them turning fisher gay. now I laugh at the prospect of them keeping him straight. this is where we re at...
we couldn t save lara croft  now we just lost sam fisher to the wokies... nooo...
then when this  modern  splinter cell doesnt sell  ubisoft will say   no one wants splinter cell .
games should be made for people who like the game  not a  new generation . that language immediately implies that older fans aren t wanted. outside of historical or technological references  if they are in the game- its been 20 yrs  I only played splinter cell once so I dont remember . nothing should really be changed.
this just after it was announced that james bond was changing to reflect  modern men . its like a meteor shower watching all these franchises go down in flames
phrase   update for modern audience. translation   we deem this product problematic and so will re-write it to fit our modern ideology while trying to erase its history. the audience themselves actually does not change. look at everything that has failed. twitter activists dont buy or engage in nerdy products  they just want to yell about everything they hate. meanwhile  us passionate nerds and geeks who are the actual audience are simply walking away from each betrayal.
I want to see them update duke nukem for  modern audiences.
I feel like sam fisher when he found out about the truth about his daughter in conviction and he goes into this rage.
we desperately need some new companies to come up. the bigger more successful ones seem to always get corrupted with woke.
these companies are ruining things we love. I hate it when this happens. but I hope its not as bad as so many other games have changed.great video melonie. keep up the good work.
we are truly in the videogame post-apocalypse... those born into this hell have no remembrance of anything else. those who survived... those are the truly broken. for they know what was before.  -griffa  mad max videogame 2015
goodbye sam. you were one of my favorite characters ever  sigh.
rip splinter cell - killed by wokeism
modern audience  is just code word for making the game a live service and turning the content woke because the director has a brain aneurism.
if I were a betting man  I d say they re most likely to change the villains  maybe take sam out of the nsa. I expect a bunch 1 6  qanon  and alex jones references more than anything else.
update to appeal to those who are not interested in games at all  what could possibly go wrong  sounds like a good plan ubi
the  changing for modern audience  is a fairly recent phrase that companies have been using  so I suspect it ll be another year or two before they realize thatsaying that making those changes actually detracts from their sales. sadly I dont see the current aaa games making a big shift back in a good direction sooner rather than later.
this.
the fact that its by modern ubisoft should ve done that already.
yep 100   was excited for this but now Im gonna avoid it completely. I got the original trilogy on ps3 so I dont need a remake  I just would have liked one. but if they re re writing the story and changing things its no longer a remake.
my fear is that they stop saying it and I buy woke garbage.
thats the phrase is like a curse.
changing for a modern audience.   puts on the glasses  here is an example of how you are to live your life in our modern world. or we ll find you.
it worked like a charm for saint s row.
used to be  streamlined for a wider audience
agreed.
pronoun rounds loaded its time to miss gender
they certainly dont mean  modern customers   because the only people who will be happy about this are game journalists and people on twitter who dont even play video games.
they are trying to get a new audience  that being the people s who s lives revolve around twitter activism. however  those people dont buy things even if they verbally praise them on social media. meanwhile  those of us that are in the original audience walk away in disgust. as a result  products fail.
they re nothing without the audience thats been buying their stuff for years now.  new audience  will never buy your shit if the initial audience is done with you. this people never learn.the gaming industry just now entering the 2018 political poison like the movie entertainment.
saving this post because its simple and perfect explanation for the new version of what woke means.
I believe it goes much deeper. companies are doing to up their esg rating for the woke investment firms like black rock. they are looking for money  and its faster to get it from firms than fans...
the original splinter cell was released 20 years ago meaning there s a generation of gamers who haven t experienced it yet.
@norman readdis  movies were woke before 2018 lol ghostbusters was 2016 and it was going on before that too
@kyle sawkon  2016 is the initial startup of it but it full throttled in 2018 with all the  peaceful  protesting with different kinds of groups know to wokedom
pretty much.
I cant wait until they tell me not to buy it!
salutes   you know the drill
it means changing for modern games urinalists
this phrase kills every single franchise in existance. I wonder why big studios keep pretending to not have noticed it yet.
yup once I read or hear them say it  I immediately lose all interest.
agreed!
in all fairness its wrong to automatically judge a game we know absolutely nothing about other than a small statement put out.in the case of updating splinter cell for a modern audience  to me personally I interpret that as removing the heavy cold war or terrorism references themes associated with the ryanverse  something sc is canon to. if this turns out to be the case then I would fully back ubI s new direction.
or it can be just coded for updated gameplay mechanics. I personally think people are just getting way too overly reacting on this woke shit. I recently saw the leak on gta 6 and nothing really looked in the slightest woke about. hell it even open up in a strip club with sexy female npcs.also keep in mind the marketing people tend to be very lefty which means it can be mismarketed completely cause of the fact. modern audiences is also way too much of a generalized term to begin with.
bingo
u guys are more sensitive than twitter lol. how u gonna let 4 vague words inform your entire perspective on a game with no trailers or gameplay lmfao
@caleb dansby  because the phrase always has the same outcome  no one s offended bro. quitstraw manning. it just tells us where the games priories will be in development lol.
caveman  stay in the past we re in the future
yep  the original story is most assuredly  problematic . such a joke.
nuff said
@rach darastrix  and we re all out of bubblegum
does that mean woke or packed full of microtransactions
@joshua allen  it means woke.
I want to give the benefit of the doubt and imagine that they just want to modernise the mechanics and gameplay to be more appealing to modern audiences because the controls of the first game didn t age very well
@psychedelic fox  I complettely agree with you
yes
@th3professor  its literally just a remake of the original game with updated mechanics. you guys need to relax with all your inaccurate speculations.
this isnt for you  this is for the new age splinter cell is ours now
exactly. the best content is timeless  content. itshouldn t need cringe  how do you do fellow kids  or woke rubbish to appeal to a modern audience. if its good then it doesnt matter how new or old the game is and what age the players are. tons of old games have young players for this reason. but like everything that these people say  its not to be taken at face value. its coded language. its a new dialect designed specifically to pull the wool. might want to check what stake blackrock or one of the myriad of its subsidiaries has in ubisoft. thats more likely what this is. these companies know going woke   going broke  problem is getting naughty points on their esg score for not being woke enough means blackrock will make them go broke anyway. it keeps happening over and over. many large companies simply aren t in a position to fight blackrock.  companies are going woke because they are being forced to. the money from consumer spending isn t the only thing at play. many companies are heavily reliant on capital from investors  and blackrock controls a gargantuan portion of that market  and their game isn t to produce good outcomes for the companies they buy into.
I cant wait to buy the collectors edition. this game is already better than the new God of war.
yup.
bruh  its the first non-binary trans black lesbian woman ever to ever become a spy. thats alone its worth a trilogy exploring they transition up to very first mission. puberty blocks conspiracy dlc available in 2024
@davI de assis  pre order to get the third echelon pride googles
really sounds like a story that will give spec ops the line a run for its money.
trans-racial
they will make fisher incompetent and grim will be the one who s gonna be saving the mission
@davI de assis  if they are so obsessed with this garbage why not make sam a alien or a robot...no because that would require imagination..
bottom.
world is where we live now
but just think  now radio conversations with lambert  who will inevitably now be a strong independent female boss b      can dispel the toxic masculinity associated with this genre by sharing words of affirmation and encouraging sam  ze zir  to work through their feelings about the systematic oppression they face.
zoomer cell
this is common everyday stuff. there is no real future with these franchises as long as they people are in charge.
@dying rose  the only hope is to refuse to engage with it  let it fail since their  intended audience  never actually supports anything  and see if they eventually correct course when the money dries up. some companies are starting to realize that the  message  cannot be pushed endlessly when the finances are gone  and are slowly embracing the  toxic  fans again.
@mr. toxicity  splinter shell.
@tkdboy1889  yes  you only have to look at the recent news about the ceo of embracer and how he is taking the news about the new saints row not doing so well. I hope him and many more will realize that the original fans dont want this crap the wokies are peddling.
ya but its ubisoft I list faith in them years ago.
lara croft peaked with the last 3 games and splinter cell will peak with these next 3
poor baby
to be honest sam told us goodbye a few times. in ghost recon  in mgs  even in conviction. sam has been a mangled corpse for a long time. then again those original games are still great so a new throwaway junk game doesnt really do anything. point is I dont know how anyone could get their hopes up after sam s many farewells.
if we cant make him black or a women  then we can just make him more in touch with his feminine side
why you think that james died in the movies and his daughter is now taking over ...james was one of the things I looked up to as a kid  because the concept was amazing  maybe little easy to create but it had its charm that no other agency character could ever re-create. I bet you that they are going to use a female lead now as jennifer bond or some shit like that and when people like me dont like it I obviously wont they are going to use all the old reasons in the book to call out fans again.
@gaia legend  they re planning to have an 007 a blck woman. that idea is still on the table and whould probably fully realize soon.
g4 tv comes to mind.
just take a look at wolfenstein youngblood to get an idea of how that would look like.
careful what you ask for
yeah - replicate the entirety of 3d to unreal 4  keep in all the content of the original.  easy.  the monies will pour in like manna from heaven.
dont kidding with this...soy patrol and woke companies has a intention to really make this true.
oh dang Im going to be piss when they change metal gear solid
its samantha fisher
in this iteration he finds out sarah is a feminist
oh God noooooooooooooooooo
haha same sentiment here. why does everything we love must turn to shit  why cant we have ever nice things
@mr. toxicity  he finds out sarah identifies as sanderson.
go buy 3 copies of kingdom come deliverance.
thanx man  Im gonna check that out today.
for the big companies  its all about the esg score. they dont actually care about this stuff.
the trick is to care less lol.  still got the originals and the memories.  get woke go broke.  I ain t buying this crap lol
@colonel radec  I have only watched far from home of modern mcu  haven t and wont watch rop. stop allowing activists to gain more power by watching their shit.
I hope its not as bad as  far cry 6 smh
@colonel radec  exactly  the only message that will ever reach them is the game sitting on shelves. speak to them with your wallet.
yes  those who remember are the masses with buckets who beg for water in the desert.  thinking of the movie
@drse 25  how dare you assume their pronouns!
rip

yeah  you just know that there will be tons of allegories to trump and the ultra-maga stuff.
yes  domestic terrorism  nationalist maga types  etc.
with ubisoft its safe to assume it will be shit. they passed on rainbow six patriots a real story where people would ve cheered for both sides to give us rainbow six siege which is essentially call of duty in a house. just beyond idiotic.
@regulator  siege was awesome at the start  then they started to only listen to competitive players who changed the game to fit their play style instead of getting good at the game
@elijah aitaok  ok but it was still call of duty in a house with some swat tactics. go check out the rainbow six patriots trailer on here. it was suppose to come out after the 2008 financial crash. the game producer lost his entire 401k when that happened and wanted to tell a great story shitting on bankers lol. knowing what we could ve had is probably why Im so salty about it.
its so sad though.  Ive always loved the splinter cell series  and the stealth genre in general  we dont get enough of  those anyway imo  why they gotta destroy such a niche category
change for modern audiences   is code to leave the franchise on the shelf and make something new.
I always assumed ubisoft wasn t releasing sc because they couldn t figure out how to turn the franchise into an open-world  multiplayer  looter shooter where they can sell the game to us in pieces for 3yrs.
love to see a woman who actually feels the same way as the rest of us
I see splinter cell and my heart soars! I then read the full title and I crash back to earth  realising that I should have known better from modern day companies...
one of my favourite games of all time. Im gonna cry internally
you confirmed my suspicion that they will probably ruin it. the silver lining for me is finding your channel! just subscribed and looking forward to all of your content.
what Ive noticed in recent years is that any game involving stealing  sneaking around  tricking others  or anything that cant have a positive spin on it in terms of morals is either being canned  wokeified  or making the characters return the stuff they stole so that the characters can be seen as your cut and dry mary sue hero so it can please an audience that the game wasn t designed for which is why characters like sly copper no longer get new games or cameos  lara croft being made into a girl next door type and emotional  and now with sam fischer being turned into who knows what which is sad cuz there is no more creativity or freedom for big name ips anymore in terms of games in an attempt to  not offend people  which is dumb.
lambert   fisher  get him to talk any way necessary sam   did you just gender assume
ok lambert  I see 3 guys up on the balcony over the-.  sam  are you out of your mind. you cant just misgender someone like that. this mission is over
they re even messing with sam fisher now  Jesus.  wish I could say it was surprised or shocked  but we keep seeing this happen.when you said  make it woke   it reminded me of jean luc picard s  make itso!
great video melonie.  sadly the madness is creeping into video game series we love now.  will have to see what they do.  on a sports note  I do have a quite a few steelers on my fantasy team so I ll be cheering for them tonight as well!
7 40 there was a time where a badass female lead for a new story  be it in a movie  game  book  etc.  would ve excited me. now with captain marvel  she-hulk  rings of power s  galadriel   little leia  etc. I go into  at least big budget western media  expecting the worst. we need more great heroes like sarah connor  lara croft  princess leia  ripley  and the bionic woman to name just a few ones I like. sadly  I dont think any big studios in the west are going to give us that for awhile. their view of women is someone perpetually  angry and afraid  to quote she-hulk. they are so convinced that they cant write a believable and compelling female hero that they create a mary-sue and have them preach at characters. badasses dont talk at people or complain about people holding them back. they get stuff done and find ways to overcome challenges thatshow off their skills and talents.
changing for modern audiences  is synonymous with  we hate you and dont want your business .
summarybad news - ubisoft doing something stupidgood news - mel is looking great.
splinter cell  became  clump of cells  for the  modern audience .
for a modern audience  is the death sentence of every ip
michael ironside has always said he wants to return as fisher again and I have desperately wanted him to.  if they are butchering the series and character  I would much rather they just leave him alone.  he will always be sam fisher to me
idea for the next game. pov  you are a member of 8 other new recruits who are being trained to become a special agent using actual woke training methods  such as being addressed by pronouns instead of name and rank  and the drill sergent not being allowed to talk to you as if you aren t the God in the room and him the peasant worshiper. the first level is also the only level. you are deployed into the battlefield. you are told  the russians dont stand a chance. their training methods are still in the nineteen eighties.  and then your whole team dies in under a minuet  and then the last thing you see is a russian soldier tea bagging you.
people in 50 years are gonna look back at this era of media and laugh their asses off
because they hate the old audience and think there s a new  more woke audience they can attract.that this supposed  new audience  rarely actually materializes never seems to phase them.
because stealth games sell shit  yet splinter cell has a huge fanbase... so yeah they need to do a splinter cell game but it cant be tom clancy espionage stuff
I reckon most do tbh. very few women wanna play games and the ones who do tend to wanna get along with guys not ruin our fun
@spiax  what are you laughing at punk
I wouldn t be surprised if they destroyed metal gear solid
its maam fisher!
noice! lol
at least the old splinter cell games are always there for me to enjoy. tom clancy games went to shit once the man himself died.
mel you made my day
changing for modern audience  is pretty much a death sentence to any franchise. its been so in the past  its not going to change any time soon. Ive never seen this done right  everyone ends up hating it.basically they just said  we re putting this one down .
this is my favourite game series. Ive completed all of them  yes  even double agent . I really hope they dont ruin this franchise.
mike  how does it feel to watch all of your favorite franchises go down in flames   - jay bauman  red letter media  202x.
changing the story for  modern audiences  from what I understood  or my take away  was changing the climate of the political warfare to be more revelant to today  instead of being more about things people are out of touch with. they recently did the same thing for punisher in the comics  rebooted him to remain relevant. instead of his war stories being about vietnam  they re about afghanistan now.
couple of points.a   blacklist  was a prequel afaik  which means that using ironside as the voice wouldn t have worked.too much wear and tear for a then fisher as opposed to a now fisher  if you catch my drift.same reason why one couldn t have ray earl jones voicing anakin. too much crud has happened to have effected the voice  thus would create an uncanny valley equivalent for the younger version.b  I fear that youre right about the buzzwords and the direction they re going to take it.which is utterly daft considering they have sarah in the wings who after  conviction  may have been far more inclined to learn dad s trade.thus setting the scene for a torch passing  because sam isn t getting any younger and would have to hang up his boots sooner or later. with his cameo in the last ghost recon dlc possibly being his penultimate mission. plus  sam s particular skillset isn t one that a female operative couldn t pull off.this isn t like being a ghost  recon  or rainbow six operative  where its far more in your face and the physical differences between males and females canthrow a curve ball into the equation.this is about not being seen heard detected. about embracing the one shot  one kill philosophy.nothing there that would prohibit a woman from doing the job.hell  her going on a revenge spree to kill the people responsible for her father s death  possibly giving his life for hers  .honestly  rather than hiring some modern  writer  to mess up the franchise  have a talk with mr. clancy as how to set the scene and cross the t s and dot the I s.this really shouldn t be that hard to pull off  asian literature fiction has been doing this for ages.my hero academia is just the most recent example.  shakes head  yet western writers keep dropping the ball far as I cantell.
for modern audiences translation  we dont want money
its getting to the point where I dont want to watch or play anything unless it is youtube content that I can choose and know that it reliably will not be pushing a progressive message to me  I am absolutely subscribed to you by the way
story pitch time for new splinter cell sam fisher has gone rogue. he and a small team of former splinter cell defectors are now considered an international threat to the point of almost being considered a rogue state. you play a new splinter cell agent who has never met sam  but naturally he is a legend who retired some years ago. he s an old man now  considered by those in the agency to be the best who ever was  but now he s an irrelevant fossil who couldn t handle being shelved  and so he s started his own rogue faction to recapture glory days and it is putting our national security at risk. lambert was your mentor and he is still guiding you through your ear piece as the next generation of splinter agent goes on a maximum deniability globetrotting stealth campaign to capture or kill fisher and his team. by the end of the second act  we have located fisher and his team and we have to infiltrate his compound to try and collect the hard drive of third echelon agents and black bag funding sources. just as we complete the task  three green lights illuminate the shadows and we are ko d. turns out  this was all a scheme by fisher and his team to expose the actual rogue element who is has taken control of third echelon  having corrupted the mission of the agency and turned it into a private hitsquad to maximize their authority and grow the agency s ability to spy on anyone anywhere domestically or internationally  and gain the authority to take out that threat before they even know they are being watched. sam and his team are there to stop it and they need your help. lambert has been a mole for them and he scouted you personally because they believe that you understand the true mission of third echelon and you wont allow it to be corrupted. the agency has a plausible deniability op on american soil  a false flag designed to enrage the american people so that they demand this new program be implemented for their own safety. now that you have been made an enemy of the state  you have no support but sam s old school team and old school stealth tactics to break in undetected  sabotage the final plan  and then expose the rogue element within the nsa. maybe even completely end the entire third echelon program if you have to.
Im a simple man   I see woke shit - I dont watch play read it
I think that  changing for modern audiences   is    morse code from the devs to the fans   they are trying to tell us     they got us  while some  men in black agents point them with a gun towards them
this is absolutely heart breaking. been waiting so long and now this....what next  wolfinstein will be re written to where youre actually the antagonist but with the same story  wonderful
I do understand the game being set in 2004 so it makes sense to kinda modernize it  sam fisher with modern technology  certainly not turbo futuristic  would be a really cool idea  and new locations and enemies  but usually when they say for modern audiences it usually ends up poorly
looking forward to seeing the big bad make something great again
melonie you always make all this bad news much easier to digest.
on either bbc or fnt  a superchat asked why they thought video games didn t seem to be going as woke as movies and tv  and someone  I cant remember who   smartly pointed out that video games take significantly longer to make than movies  so we can still expect the wave of woke video games to come crashing down on us soon.  with saints row  the interview about gta6  and now splinter cell  it looks like that time has arrived.glad I almost entirely moved away from aaa games a few years ago  because the timing indicates its going to be a wokey woke woke woke next 4 or 5 years in the aaa gaming industry.
the sad thing is not that long ago  the news of a remake  with better graphics and gameplay etc.  probably would have excited most people.  now it just makes everyone groan thinking   how are they going to ruin this one
I have enjoyed the last couple of splinter cell games especially conviction such a shame its going down this road but its not surprising this is definitely an easy pass for me
holy shit.. it never ends.
this is so sad to hear about. I was excited for this just like you were mel but now idk if Im even going to buy the game now. they need to keep that woke shit out of our games!!!!
how is the entertainment industry always the last to know they re doing things wrong
video games have been on that path ever since the likes of anita sarkeesian started to cry bully games industry into changing in accordance with her regressive views.first games that reeked of that influence started to come out in 2014  like dragon age inquisition.
a big part of the indie game scene has been woke for years  so yeah aaa is only just coming around to it lately  but you moving away from aaa and not noticing that the indie space is one of the most influenced spaces when it comes to wokeism  Im wondering if you moved to physical board games or something.
there s a space in between triple a and indie...
@not telling  yep  commonly called double a
@tigoniii  nope. the difference is there are countless more indie and double a games to choose from  so its easy to steer clear of anything with social messaging.
if they re directing the reboot at  modern audiences   I know damn well michael ironside will be no where close to this. they should just leave the series alone. if you cant do it right  dont do it a all.
humanity has literally lost their minds. and the really upsetting part is there are probably more people who are against all this stupidity  but they re just too scared to say it in fear of being shunned
the closest we got to new splinter cell storyline with sam fisher  voiced by mr ironside   was in ghost recon wildlands and breakpoint. sam fisher quote in ghost recon wildlands  k- you look like you ve clocked some miles since are last meet. sf-  yeah  they dont make em like they used too. there was this other guy  army infuriation. he wore a bandana or something. k-  I heard he retired. sf-  really  Im the only one left...
being a curvy woman is illegal  was hilarious
splinter cell  blacklist is my favorite in the series. Im glad I can always play that. the missions are long enough and Im on my second playthrough on pc since I first played it on ps3 when it launched in 2013.
the last good splinter cell game was the ps2 version of double agent  and I believe that is the last splinter cell game that tom clancy himself had a hand in writing
I was looking forward to this remake when it was rumors. now its being remade for  modern  audiences is a red flag and what will sam take down the enemies by saying the wrong pro nouns.
this is why I always said I dont want another splinter cell because I knew they d ruin it.
I love splinter cell and have been waiting for a new release and return to the original play style of the originals.
when I heard about the game being reworked I was so excited  I fucking loved splinter cell growing up  the use of tactical non-lethal weapons  the multi-vision goggles  the smart and cool dialogues between sam and whoever was in the earpiece... but all that excitement went to sht when I read that they ll update the story to current times  which we know means to just add woke garbage in it
a lot of game companies dont know what remakes mean anymore. man  when these companies need to learn that remake means building everything from the ground up in a new engine and keeping the story  dialogue  cutscenes  etc.  the same with updated graphics and mechanics... wait  too much work these corrupted lead devs and some newbies to the game development.
the funny thing is they already tried to  modernize  the formula and everyone saw how it went.
damn melonie  I havent seen you since about 2015  wth nice to see ya again
...because  appealing to a modern audience  has gone so well every time its been implemented.
I dont keep up with this young lady often but hearing a former fragdoll rip ubisoft is satisfying
did sam fisher pass down the torch  to his daughter   lol in the books  did she have the type of training he did  becz he was best of the best lol so it might not make sense for him to pass it on to his little girl  if he had 1  dont remember  but I get why she would have the idea back in the day  I probably had thoughts like that about characters I like too  esp when I was younger.
I started making classic doom levels again and now Im really starting to think I should just learn how to code and make video games. Im getting tired of waiting around lol
and they re gonna make him be able to  talk  to bad guys more and see why they are doing  bad things.
lambert   let it go fisher..
the problem with them bringing in sam fisher s daughter   sarah to play the role is she died in the third game     chaos theory I thought her daughter died.
I dont think any of us splinter cell fans expected we would get an authentic experience from ubiwoke. sadly since gamer gate the gaming community has been pretty divided on these matters  so I wont even rulel out this abomination is going to be a succes.
highly recommend michael ironside in 1981 david cronenberg s scanners  the film with the best head explosion ever on film. ironside has one of the best fictional antagonist name  daryl revok.
the military espionage genre is in desperate need for an androgenous purple haired agent that uses ze-zem pro nouns
so depressed about splinter cell but go boom
plus melonie  I love it when you show your screen and I can see a comment Ive made. its the simple things.
as a die hard splinter cell fan  this makes me just sad
I am not surprised. I was officially done with ubisoft after watchdogs legion was revealed  and I say this as someone who loved the first watchdogs game. during a trailer for watchdogs legion  there is a scene with protesters  and one of them was holding up a sign thatsaid  stay woke . that was enough to keep me from wasting my money on the game  and I have avoided funding ubisoft since then.
this is not what I intended when I said I wanted splinter cell to come back
I dont think a  modern audience  exist in that they would be too different from 10 15 years ago. of course people born in that time have their own tastes but they havent replaced the audience that originally existed for your product and have probably had a chance to become fans of the media you created because its still in the market. its so annoying that these companies are taking properties that have a fanbase and changing it to appeal to someone else and expecting the fans to just fall in line and pay them while simultaneously telling them their bad people.
Im still over here waiting for the live action movie starring tom hardy as sam fisher. when did the teaser trailer for that release  like in 2007
let me guess  this new game is gonna have us play as a samantha fisher and she will be on quest to curbstomp people who wouldn t use someones proffered pronouns through using her weapon  twatter cancelation.
sam fisher is honestly pretty overlooked as a character. I like him more than snake honestly. his character is more subtle but I think much more profound. he s able to display his immense skill and intrigue in personality in a better way. the guys a badass. it makes these games more fun than they already are and truly immerses you.
darn  I was really looking forward to a new splinter cell game. hopefully the gameplay is decent.
I saw that headline for tarzan s live action and busted out laughing
I am playing currently ghost recon wildlands which is really good. nothing is woke in the game except the bolivian women radio podcast hosts. I am currently on the mission where I have to meet up with sam fisher I thought it was pretty cool hearing his voice in ghost recon wildlands talking to my team leader  myself . sad to see splinter cell going wone
our only choice is to stop engaging with these games movies comics until the money does our talking for us. support small independent creators that put entertainment and quality above message. large publishers will eventually have to answer to their shareholders.
pride flag blue hair rainbow night vision goggles let s do this.
Ive always wondered why people weren t so keen on double agent. sure it wasn t as good as chaos theory but the ps2 version of double agent is not only my favourite splinter cell games but in my top 10 favourite games ever.
Im not going to assume that it will be woke. like you said  splinter cell has always featured a diverse cast and a strong female character. they are bringing back sam fisher  so my guess is that the storyline will be different and that we may see sprinkles of leftist bullshit being dropped by a few characters here and there. Im happy that they didn t make the dumb decision to make sarah a splinter cell  they very well could in this new version  because itsimply wouldn t have made sense given her character in the previous games. if the new version shows her character to be in the military or a government agency like the cia  you can expect her to take over in a future game. I dont understand reboot. we had briggs from blacklist  so why not use his character as the main protagonist and have fisher in a support role as the new lambert  as long as the gameplay is enhanced and the campaign story is great  it will do fine. splinter cell games have always been for  modern audiences   but it appears that ubisoft doesnt even know their own work  so maybe we should be worried about who is calling the shots over there.
youre a splinter cell fan       there are many layers to your personality
im dead
well  they woke-ified jack ryan in season 2 of the amazon series. I guess we couldn t think tom clancy was safe.
oh wow never figured a company would be so bent on going bankrupt yet here we are...
the past will never go awayto hell with the future
side note  if youread the books you ll find thatsam fisher s love interest is a strong female character  who runs her own martial arts studio.
so in like 24 hours your previous statement about reboots is proven right
praying for the best  preparing for the worst....
sam is now samantha  and sarah is the protagonist and sports a hip rainbow stripe led pattern on their goggles lol
ok  so splinter cell ended with blacklist.
trans fisher ... stunning and brave
I think in this specific case  its not that big of an issue tbh. the political climate has changed a lot and game companies are more aware that they always portray america as the good guys and other countries  especially russia  china and korea  as the bad guys. I am not gonna say this game will be good or bad  I will simply remain cautiously optimistic as more papa sam fisher is what gaming needs right now.
ftw used to stand for for the win... now it means something else to me.
welp  looks like splinter cell is gonna be on the shelf for a long time after this one
its under the tom clancy umbrella so Im choosing to remain optimistic about what this means. like how sam s pistol  the five seven  never really performed out of the handgun as advertised so maybe he d use a nato standard or  hell  even keep the five seven  but adopt the current mk. 3 optics ready version. his rifle  the f2000  is kind of a bag of shit in the real world. certainly overall  but even in the world of bullpups. that could use an update. some of the tech bits definitely would need to be updated if they re doing a modern setting. the conflict with georgia might seem a little dated  where it made sense to sam and crew in the first decade or so post cold war. could definitely work on characterizations since we know where characters like lambert and grimm end up in the story. maybe plant some seeds there  beef up the relationship with sarah  they tried this in blacklist . modern audiences tend to expect more from their stories. so yeah  remaining positive for now  lol.
sam fisher character is one my old favs!  I dont have any confidence in this reboot.
the only time updating the material for a modern audience should be done is in the context of things like the netflix punisher where they made him a veteran of the war on terror instead of a vietnam veteran. it leaves the character traits without making it a period piece.
I swear these companies dont pay attention to eachother. if they did they d realize woke reboots sequels dont sell.
title just crushed me... such fond memorys playing thru the original trilogy.big sad. hope the backlash they get is enouormous
sam fisher is going to have a mission where he is going after someone for mean tweets.
sam is going to be ghey and in need of validationthat could actually be turned into an interesting game mechanicwhen on infiltration you must avoid detection but first you have to monitor your validation bar because if it gets to low  sam will burn his cover and shout   hey you ! notice me !!   which will lead sam to his demise and the player to a game over screen
Ive been waiting so long for another splinter cell game as Imiss games that were one genre and did it as best as it could be done  like with splinter cell or skate. Im sick of them taking old properties that are popular for a reason and shitting all over their fanbase. from splinter cell to static shock  to star wars  to superman  its almost like they re trying to start a war.
this guy gets it.
1990s  we fight for survival.2020s  we fight because someone used the wrong pronouns.
I can 100  say  I have  a feeling that its going to be like the saint row reboot...
rip splinter cell.but I do look forward to being called all the standard names for disliking it.
this industry needs an enema!
there was a crossover between splinter cell and ghost recon. I know this will fall on deaf ears but I hope they dont go this route with not only splinter cell but also ghost recon too  but who am I kidding  its gonna happen. its ubI  they hate working games and its player base
I hope this never happens to a from sofware title.
woke people dont play splinter cell. they are catering to an audience that doesnt exist for their game.
God damn  thank you melonie  u da best
the feeling I get is that meme with the guy and his girlfriend out for a walk  and he s looking over his shoulder at another woman.who are they talking about when they say modern audiences  we re still here. the games were not made that long ago.
good news!  they re making a new splinter cell!bad news!  they re making a new splinter cell!
my hobbies include  sports  video games  movies  and fishing.  more and more I find myself fishing instead of the others.  a damn fish ain t gonna go woke on me
I guess its time for jack carr to start making video games
yesterday it was conan. today we learn its sam fisher  james bond and even the wizard of oz. I am so over this modernity crap
well  mel  you might get your sarah fisher as a splinter cell if they are gonna change it for a modern day audience.
they did enough when they changed the voice from michael ironside. he helped immerse you in the dark. then they did not know how to write for him after blacklist  so they were out of practice with no tom clancy-style stories. they need to diverge from the source of the character and make him something he is not. like a sword-wielding punisher  or a non-gruff sam fisher toxic masculine single father.
for a modern audience  how about just for the game s central audience  for those of us who have been waiting a long time for the series to return  this is disappointing news!
sc was my favourite game series for a long time   well the first 4 anyway . its sad they invested money to bring it back and did this. now it ll never make a good comeback.
well ffs  rip another part of my childhood...
I think splinter cell can absolutely move on without michael ironside. the atmosphere and tone is really what sells the classic games  spy thriller with lots of dark humour . I loved blacklist  but the team chat was too direct and objective focussed like you d expect from a ghost recon game.
the audience they re hoping to appeal doesnt play this!!!
business as usual.
I think they know that  but the message is so important that they will bomb franchises to push their ideologies.
I cant help but laugh at your comment given the character in this series is named sam fisher.
what happaned to james bond
changing for modern audiences     cue drinker voice  the message.
wow this splinter cell game is amazing.....wish they had blue haired people in it  said no gamer ever.
as of more grimmdotir on the field  people tend to forget she was on the field. remember conviction  shes the one stopping the vilain after all.
ubisoft basically kicking a dead horse.also tom clancy rolling in the grave right now.
this kinda breaks my heart ong.
any thought on the  cameo of lara croft and sam fisher in ghost recon breakpoint
now days the question is which franchises haven t gone woke answer-not many but cobra kaI is one of the rarer exceptions in fact the show mocks it.
seriously! this hurts my heart.
I cant take any more reboots. wouldn t surprise me if they made sam younger and had him figuring out how to be the sam we all know and love. wait  thatsounds familiar. thats assuming sam doesnt become female. oh well  I just picked up the og xbox game in a bargain bin and will be playing that one again. have fun watching the steelers game  I ll be cheering them on.
this one hurts bad! I dont really play games anymore. the xbox360 was the last console I bought. the splinter cell or gta series are the only sequels I would upgrade for..
blood hell      what isn t getting a reboot in this day and age. what happened to longevity  you d think companies who own some of the biggest ip s would want to extend the lifecycle of their most recognisable games  shows  and movie franchises instead of changing them. you cant call someone the same name  change everything about them and expect the fans who paid for this new  modern  game to not be happy. its identity fraud at this point. 5 9   now 5 4 . Im looking at your crystal
they did it to the new splinter cell book. turning sarah fisher into a new agent. sarah is supposed to represent the humanity side of sam  not as a carbon copy of her father. ubisoft should just made another character.
corporate toxicity is really what it means...
the  modern audience  wants the same as the old audience.
im a fan   good job
sam    yeah boss   seen what they ve done to the military    yeah.  that bulls  t ain t happening round here  got it  spread the word. first person that even mentions anything woke   yeah   will be sent to siberia with bob   steve. got it  Im black- that ll have to be good enough... if they know what s good for  em.  yeah. there ya go clancy. game updated. now  can we get back to what we love  or do I have to call bs
so they re gonna do sam like they did joel  a  splinter of us part 2  if you will. though this is ubisoft so they might not put in that much work  more likely that they nerf the stealth into assassin s creed  far cry stealth.
these companies never heard of a backbone apparently  and pathetic
at worst I expected they would water down the gameplay for a modern audience... not the story itself
better hope it really is woke or youre gonna be in for a rude awakening on twitter lol
just replayed the original on the new machine.  it was still fun  and less blurry than before.  cant think of anything that needed to be  fixed  or  updated.   since the support characters are already  diverse   they must be targeting sam fisher himself for an  update.   what a stupid  stupid idea that would be.
rough and gritty. blacklist style is what we need.
and he s gonna have a little beard and a man bun.
Ive played through and beaten all of the original 3 games more times than can even remember so much so that Ive memorised all the best routes through the levels and have all the door codes memorised and I fail to see any themes in any of these games that could be considered inappropriate for even woke sensitivities.
the old audience is the ones that make them popular and a lot of money.
when they sat they want a bigger audience or a modern audience  they really mean a small niche audience  but that wouldn t please investors.
if all they do is make a few modest changes to reflect the current technology and geopolitical makeup of the world  I d be ok with that. we all know that the only makeup that they want to change is gonna be sam fishers eyeliner though.
its getting ridiculous!! are these companies getting some sort of compensation for going woke  most everyone that does this looses money  fan base etc.
it be cool if they let up play as lambert and tell sam what to do while hes sitting in his office or van lmfaoo
story was fine the way it was. argh.
I recently joined the pc master race because Im not going to play  let alone buy  any woke games and there are so many fantastic older games on steam  gog and elsewhere that will keep me occupied to my dying day. Im currently playing the original saints row. its the perfect antidote to the woke rubbish being churned out on consoles.
sam fisher better be the main protagonist  bring in a second character. in case they want to retire sam  as much as I would hate that  you can continue with the other.
splinter cell is going woke oh hell naw!!!
modern audiences is something that the critical drinker often quotes in a very sarcastic way. rewriting a movie  tv show or game for modern audiences is synonymous with rewriting a movie to push a political message  specifically changing things to match a radical left ideologue. because a diverse range of characters ain t already enough!
golden rule  get woke  go broke!!
made for modern audience  has become a major red flag. they all use it now  for tv shows  films and now games. the audience hasn t changed.....they are actively shifting the narrative to pander to people that wont even play it.
no kidding. even ubisoft has gone woke for years and splinter cell remake will have some work elements to it melanie
ok but here s my question what audience  seriously if there were actually people that would spend money for this stuff I d understand the change but every time they do this they lose more money then they can hope to make from these changes
we all know  sam has a daughter which will run the show..... let s see.
ubisoft is about to go bankrupt.
any trans characters in those games  what about poc s or latinx  sam fisher surely is the embodiment of toxic masculinity.
@robovader  no trans but definitely has poc one of which is your boss and your technical operations officer is a woman as well as chief intelligence operative is a jewish woman.  the main character sam fisher is also a single father to a teenage daughter.
I guess ubI didn t see what happened to the new saints row game.
maybe they re just going to make splinter cell an open world game  Imean modern audience like open  world than traditional linear games right  knowing ubisoft they re into the whole open world genre since assassin s creed and watchdogs became huge.
modern audience  looks like they saved me 60 bucks.
what itsounds like but at the same time really not 100  means its goin woke
melonie-san. have you ever considered writing your own graphic novel  I would totally buy it  senpai.
its the fact that people talk about these things  is why its popular    if we all could collectively shut out this  woke  narrative  I truly believe it d be irrelevant and disappear. its all about clout
this is where we re at...  cause its true
well  time to go and make my based  red cell  for a  selective niche audience.
the name would be change to  sammy fishy
yeah  that worked great for saints row didn t it
title   splinter cell is going wokevideo   6 29   9 32
live-action cowboy bebop  lokI  batwoman  captain marvel  kevin smith s he-man  last of us 2  picard  the marvels  ghostbusters 2016  last jedI  she-hulk  kenobI  rings of power... is anyone else reminded of that adage about insanity being  repetition of the same action with the expectation of a different outcome
the new splinter cell is doa.
I really hope they actually just update it to make it better.Imean  it happened with top gun  so maybe it ll happen with splinter cell I prefer to try to stay optimistic so I dont just go full nihilist...
awesome....I just cant wait to play as samantha fisher who solo s her way through every mission cos she dont need no help from no man..... lol
cool.  I ll buy a copy for me and one for you  too.
at this point Im not bothered anymore  im actually quite excited to see how they ruin it. there should be a woke bingo and every  modern audience  troupe they add you get a prize.
walker the texas ranger  with night vision.
modern audience  has become such a red flag. there have been more than enough examples of beloved stories and i.p.s getting  modernized  in a way thats all about including  progressive elements  while not putting any focus in good story telling or character development  creating either very mediocre or downright bad products as a result.Ive seen very  very few  updated  stories franchises that managed to capture the original charm and spirit while modernizing certain parts and making things enjoyable.
spoilers its an old game if you haven t played it  play it!dont forget wilkes a male character who helps sam  who they kill off to replace with a woman and it worked it fit
yes that is my dream! Ive written a story and drawn out my main character   so I need to just put in the work and start making it. its just a bit overwhelming tho haha
@melonie mac go boom  just make the character go boom  cant go wrong.
@melonie mac go boom  I love the art you showed for this before. I hope you share more as you make progress.
make some stuff for the 90s audience.  now  thats an audience with some chest hair.
Im not surprised  but Ive given up on most of western entrainment industry today as I keep on saying. mostly japanese and indies is what I play nowadays. also  why yet another remake reboot and not simply a new entry into the series  are they really that creatively bankrupt to come up with new stories  -
companies seem to hate making money these days.
my spidey sense tells me this is going to not be what the og fans want. surprised...nope
as multiple others have already pointed out  I think people might be overinterpreting the recent statements made by ubisoft. especially the whole  wokeness  thing.in my opinion ubisoft is increasingly trying to avoid any geopolitical scenarios too heavily tied to reality.although maybe not  woke  by defiinition it can certainly be described as an appeasement approach.a fitting example for this might be the recent ghost recon games  where they moved away from bolivia in wildlands to a fictional country in breakpoint.this might also be the reason why pandora tomorrow is not purchasable anymore   because of the east timor setting...  I am guessing they will move away from the georgia-plot and establish something new  maybe even in a fictional country. this would be especially sad considering the nature of tom clancy and its roots in real-life events. this is what I think is meant by  for a modern day audience . it is inconveniently phrased.  a lot of optimism here on my part I also think with videos like this one  you do the whole thing no justice  at the moment  nearly all videos on this topic share the same narrative . conclusions like this one feel like they are pulled out of thin air.
you have to say all your games are going to be for modern day audiences when youre sexually assaulting so many of your employees. how else are they supposed to deflect criticism without taking radical measures like stop sexually assaulting their employees.
watch them do the same for metal gear solid.
splinter cell  where a spec ops operator now for some reason  needs everyone to know his sexual preferences. this is re-fuckin-tarded  we all know it will be something like this.
modern audience  is code for  we hate this franchise and want it to die so we can focus on free-to-play garbage
if the game has good stealth-gameplay and I  m not woke-cringing too much  this game ist for me
Im sure they will have sam fisher now be attracted to men....becuse that adds so much depth and plot to the splinter cell gameplay.
the new phantom audience dont ever have any money.
I swear if they ruin this franchise  I will officially be done with anything ubisoft
I wish it was just going to be a solid remaster. but noooooooo.
a modern audience means fischer is going to be dragged around by a stunning and brave female character. then they are all going to cry at the end.
cant wait for a strong female character to walk all over sam.
hello melonie I wanted wish you  yourfamily have wonderful weekend coming up let s go pittsburgh steelers!!!!!! takecare melonie
let s just hope the game isn t going woke because sam fisher is the last tactical espionage game we have this is itsnake is gone  gabe logan gone.
at some point these creeps are going to have to get tired of losing money.
I had an opportunity to buy a ps5 recently and I turned it down specifically because of stuff like this. when you buy a console  you aren t just buying it for what s on the market now  youre also investing in that console s future. sad to say  but the video game industry is creatively bankrupt at the moment and that future does not look worthy of investing my time or money in.
read the new book.  they introduced a new female agent.  I think the story was great and nothing was woke.  I think it made sense for splinter cell.
lambert will constantly be talking about buying a toaster oven.
something I dont understand is that nothing that they update in order to adapt to  modern audience  ends up being a success. so why do they keep doing it
sam  as in samantha fisher. God help them.
sam fisher would ve glad to know if he s gone as well with snake.Im not existed for a syphon filter nowadays specially with playstation commiefornia is in concern.
Imiss watching the steelers. I just couldn t keep watching them after the entire team hid in the tunnel while alejandro villanueva stood on the sidelines for the national anthem by himself. dude was an army ranger that earned multiple medals for rescuing squad mates while under heavy fire. that was the last nfl game I watched altogether actually. heard they started honoring a rapist and  if I remember right  murderer the next season so I was very happy I stopped supporting them when I did.
update for modern audience refers to 5  of the real audience and ignoring that will see it fail
modern audience  means  we want to make the game for the blue hair land whales on twitter and not you know  the fans. we want to make sure we virtue signal until the game is a complete failure and burn as many bridges behind us as possible!
they re making splinter cell woke so fans van stop asking for a new splinter cell
ugh looks like ill stick with conviction  I keep my 360 set up to play it frequently. right before ubI pulled the plug on their convitiin matchmaking website  I had 80 k kills.  lol that wasin 2015 and I stoll go back to conviction frequently.
when you see or hear the term  updated for a modern audience  that means its going to be a pile of crap that appeals to nobody. rumors are that disney is considering remaking the three original star wars movies to  update them for a modern audience  and to force them to fit their continuity errors they incompetently installed in their movies. if they do this they wont get my money.
if youre still giving these woke corporations money  stop it. as long as you keep giving them money  they re not going to change.
to me the last great splinter cell game was double agent.
I thought splinter cell ended...
his visor will highlight everyone s pronouns within a thirty foot radius.
maybe  and hopefully modern audience means people used to the sophistication new games have today
he s a ninja assassin. he sneaks around and kills bad guys. nothing needs to change. any new generation of players dont matter.
splinter cell  the gender re-assignment surgery edition when sam fisher becomes samantha fisher!there will be bullets and hormone pills at your closest gamestop!
sam is a gender neutral name  so I guess the game s reveal will be like a gender reveal party.
when I heard the news I was excited but then when they said changing it for a modern audience. I cringed because the wokeness is a potential
changing for a non-existent audience is more like it.
I wish the majority of shareholders of ubisoft would vote to make a game fun instead of a political debate
I wonder if they dropped securom yet.
after just looking at the title   Jesus Christ  is syphon filter next    how in frigid hell are they going to wokify metal gear  I cant even imagine how that would be possible.  solid snake is a macho power fantasy moreso than lara croft.
I cant wait to play sam fisher as a pansexual furry who goes under cover using different pronouns
I dont think I can buy this game until its seen as to what is changed...
conviction was the last good splinter cell story wise. they made anna a field agent and it was cool as fuck. next game they put her right back behind a desk. lost opportunity.
damn you ubisoft
its not the same without michael ironside.
yes  avoiding will be the best thing we can do. but young people who dont know anything will be molded by it and will buy cause they dont know what s right and wrong.
sam will be a quadriplegic now. cyberhandiman 2022.
brace yourselves bois  we are now all wacist and swexist and phobes for not wanting this remake
sam fisher is short for samantha fisher in this game
one of my favorite ubisoft characters is ezio auditore. Im just glad that the older characters have died off so that they cant be transformed by  the message!  still  new characters are fair game to these devs
oh God please no! please dont let em make a  modern  splinter cell  I d rather have no new splinter cell at all  even if I grew up on those games and they made me to who I am  d
being rebuilt with the snowflake engine
in other words  they re going to make it a playable movie with plenty of world view confirmation biases for millennial self-proclaimed  nerds  who didnt touch the game  or any game for that matter  when they were teenagers and most likely have an array of funko pops in their living room.
cant wait to play as samantha fisher they them
they should get the writers of saints row to rewrite the script. they did a fantastic job of ruining their own product. Im sure they could ruin  modernise  other people s work.
by modern they mean catering to those who have never spent a dime on the franchise. or haven t carried it through the decades. sounds about right for ubisoft.
why cant we have nice things
the obvious move is to have sam pass the torch to his long lost half latino son rodrigo  who part way through the game reveals that he wants to be a woman and that the team is to call her lorretta from now on.
they r re writing it because the og game is about the main character breaking into a chinese consulate...for the cia
what s sad is that  modern audiences  dont actually play the games  read the comics  or watch the movies.  modern audiences  just sit and complain on twitter all day.
changing for modern audience. freaking wild. like imagine them not using russia in their game due to everything going on. I think people look a little too far into things like this is funny. but more sad than funny.
sam fishers going on a golfing weekend with abby  well bugger this game can be left on the shelf
looking forward to sam fisher being voiced by some campy fruit.
everyone protect snake at all costs
thankfully I never enjoyed the games but I feel bad for true fans of it.
as a splinter cell fan guess I will never buy or play splinter cell again
here comes samantha fisher  the first they them super spy.
modern audience just means adhering to  correct  political takes which also means   we re devoid of creativity so why not score brownie points with twitter
toronto  canada and woke. suprise suprise.
not only do you have to worry about going woke  we still need the game to not be shit or broken  modern gaming can not be trusted even with aaa studios. sad really.
never played it  thatsaid I hope they do not ruin it for the old players
modern day audience     being woke.
what I hope this means  new campaign settings and political intrigue that applies to today  as well as updated mechanics and controls for today s players.what I know this actually means
when the dev said they going made the game for the modern audiences we all know what that mean  alot stuff that was in the past game are about to be remove and some new stuff that nobody want going be in there and I bet money they either made one of the character gay for some reason like I wont be surprised if they made sam gay or they going race switch one of the character  like I got a strong feeling by the end of the game sam going be replace by a all-powerful women with no training at all and she going be better at everything
I think I would prefer the rabbids taking over this series over that.
sam is made into a bisexual hispanic man  sarah is going to be half black  and grim is going to become a God-tier splinter cell agent  so she can emasculate sam by doing everything he does but better.
its going to be samantha fisher putting the black back in black ops
the saint s row game was made for modern audiences and that hasn t gone so well for the developers... being outsold by 10  year old gta 5
sam fisher has transitioned to samantha fisher confirmed...
funny  but their  modern audience  should be the exact same audience that enjoyed the games in the first place. they mean it as  a completely different audience of woke activist college students that never played the originals and wont play the remake either.
I have a feeling they ll kill sam fisher in the first 30 minutes of the game and a new strong wamen will take his place.
noooooooooo! are they trying to ruin all their solid ips
why not just make a new splinter cell for the  modern audiences     and let the remake alone
mostly I just buy indie games these days... big companies games have become quite bad for quite some time.
the woke crowd is the weak crowd. thats why all the hard core hero s all go weak. if they ever change johnny sliver hand from his character  from being the person he is to update everything and make him weak  that would make me hate cyberpunk then. thats one of the reason I like that game soo much.
Imean  splinter cell series died a long time ago  the last game was boring. so expecting now a remake that would beat the last one is impossible lol. ubisoft is one of the worst .  you can be certain there will be a very strong women leading lambert and sam to do the right thing in this one.   and the plot of the game will probably be sam fighting against domestic terrorists and sending pink popsicles to ukraine.
I was gonna say you look abit young to be a splinter cell fan but 30 is the new 20
I just dont get it  I just dont get.  the tomb raider anniversary remake was so good for the sole reason that it told the same story but just updated the graphics and ability to interact with the environment that made the puzzles much more interesting.  as another splinter cell  fan this breaks my heart  I loved sams deadpan wit  the sparring with that gorgeous icelandic american  redhead grim  yeah she was my teenage crush even though she was just a voice coming out from the speaker  and lambert s carolinan drawl.  if it ain t broke dont fix it.
this is where Im at.
toronto .that explains a lot. we have the people that make syfy shows making our games.
if we got a faithful remake of all the games leading upto double agent  maybe including it  made it take place in the 2020 s  and the only other major difference is that other characters poked at sam being gay or him mentioning his husband back home watching sarah after his wife died or something  I would be just fine. he can be dumbledore gay all day.my two dad s but its splinter cell coop campaign where the players have to sneak past sitcom situations to help their lesbian daughter.
Im glad I never gave splinter cell a chance. now I dont have to see another thing I enjoyed be killed.
I wonder if this one s gonna be like the other 2 ubisoft games where you also murder multibillionaire bearded tech nerds.
nope  Im out. they wont be getting my money.
the steelers are embarrassing  the najee fumble summed it all up
Goddamn it!!!!! why do they have to kill this franchise. actual proper stealth games are so f     few and far between nowadays and we ve been waiting for this franchise to not be neglected or butchered for well over a decades now.
you would expect any less from 2022 ubisoft
these devs need to keep their politics out of my games
it going wole probably wont be much worse in this case. if I remember correctly the original splinter cell games were awesome but story and setting wise it was basically bush-era  pro war propaganda.
this is where we re at  t-shirts  when
i...  am... sam mother f n fisher! I swear to God  if they do this to my franchise  ubisoft will not get one more red cent out of me. splinter cell doesnt need a remake  it needs another sequal. each game in the franchise has been an improvement of the last  and all we want is more sam fisher esque gameplay.  I get it  sam fisher is getting old  but that just means he may need to pass the torch  not that the existing franchise needs to be overhauled.
ubisoft presents  alana fisher  a black bI woman  is the new agent  tasked to enter and dismantle the most evil corporation  ttf  the trump foundation
I have the og xbox and 360 splinter cell games  so I ll survive.
the gameplay has changed a lot between the first game and blacklist  so I dont understand what the problem is with a game like pandora tomorrow for example being upgraded to blacklist gameplay. and if you dont like that then just play pandora tomorrow. whats the big deal.
I got news for you  every single american ip is going woke.
these things never make sense. they shouldn t even announce it either because all they re doing is screwing themselves from the start. but its like they want to remake all these old ip s because they want that built in fanbase the ip brings  as well as those nostalgia dollars. but then they do this and pander to people who dont buy their products but just  like the idea of these things existing . actual fans dont recognize the ip and feel like they re being lectured to somehow  and they usually lose the thing that made these ip s work by forcing woke bs  which is really what a corporate suit thinks woke people would like. its as tone deaf as it gets. I thought after a couple times of doing this companies would realize they like making money and stop this nonsense. but they continue to basically throw money in a pile and set it on fire.
director of third echelon - irving lambert a black man.communication lead and super highly skilled hacker anna grimsdottir a woman.  how is this not good enough   I never thought anything about them other than what a great team they made.
itseems Im not the  modern audience
Im sure the designers and writers will have nothing but respect for the franchise.samantha fisher  half-shorn strong black woman   you are too old  white man. I am the new splinter cell.
they dont have modern audience  their audience are the same audience from 2002
ubisoft please...-----------------------------well  I guess we shouldn t be too surprised. modern day ubisoft  has done it again.it could have been so simple  1  remake the original splinter cell properly and  reintroduce  sam fisher as an integral part of ubisoft s lineup.     2  one last splinter cell game  with sam  voiced only by mr. ironside   passing the torch along to someone else. briggs from splinter cell blacklist for example 3  place sam in a  mentor role   our new lambert  from then on  or do it at the end of thatsequel  as a sort of  epilogue .this would end the sam fisher storyline  and make way to establish a new cast of characters.instead we ll probably get this  woke fiesta . in all seriousness   I honestly hope it wont be that bad.
I to as a fan of so thing know regret.... for I wanted a sequal to rage. instead got a  sequal to rage  made by compleatly different developers...im sure they will treat sam fisher like  their original game franchise! rayman! the were they conpleatly replaced the protagonist and ousted him from his own story for illusion entertainment minnions... before dispicable me was even a thing...
its not a remake if they are changing it
in all fairness I think its premature to assume ubI is going  woke  with splinter cell.  if anything I think ubI could be alluding to present geopolitical realities.many of tom clancy s works in the jack ryanverse  including video games which are canon to that  splinter cell included  carried a heavy cold war theme. my guess is that ubI wants to update that by removing those cold war themes to reflect the post-cold war reality. if ubI is doing this then I would wholly support them.we re no longer fighting a cold war and in the interest of peace Im glad the entertainment world has moved past that its long overdue video games follow suit.
ok cool so they re telling me not to buy it.  done.
the series painted the country in a somewhat noble light. thats unacceptable in today s social climate of  cops  military  and country bad .
sarah was never a part of the military  she never wanted to be and sam would never have let her go down that road. she is the only thing he has left. sam took on a suicide mission beucase he heard about her  death  and thought he had nothing left to live for. now  in conviction we learned that her death was faked and then sam goes on this crusade to make sure she is safe again! making sarah a 4e  4th echelon  operative is random and unnecessary.  and if the  modern audience  thing turns out to be true all the people who came up with that have no respect for the source material and need to be replaced with people who can actually think and create new and interesting ideas  stop disrespecting tom clancy s legacy  ubisoft!
bahaha I gotta do that
the same modern-day audience that the new saints row was made for
it was a great franchise  but now its screwed.
here comes samantha fisher....hard pass.
its ubisoft they are woke. not any surprise here. in for honor years ago now valkyrie had the  no touching  execution. basically you killed your opponent and they trip  accidentally grabbed valks breasts before valk kicked them in the nuts and caves their skull in with her shield. fierce independent woman that doesnt need a man to protect her but they removed it because some libs got butthurt over it.
sam fisher is masculine  alpha male  and is a strong father figure. he doesnt stand a chance
ugh even the fisch man is getting ruined.grimm ... request backup immediately
whether it is movies or games  remake is code for spitting on legacy.  I didn t want a robocop remake.  I didn t want a total recall remake.  I didn t want a ben-hur remake.I dont think they are making this game for russia. that would break the rules of the banking overLords.
yes  splinter cell was diverse but it didn t had dragon they them
dont preorder the game  guys. do not. preorder. the game. trust me. you will only have yourself to blame when youre crying in online posts. the game isn t going to disappear if you dont play it the minute it is released. wait and see what the general consensus of it is before you buy it.
how can you make a war game woke  war really doesnt care about your feelings. it utterly destroys them
well  time to cue up another one bites the dust... I just read an article about it. definitely not wasting money on this one.
always loved splinter cell.  these companies forget that men are only woke for their women and men are their target audience.  some women play video games for sure  but like all men do.  will be doa
melonie is so fine
these companies are cowards and dont think this woke trash will sell a new franchise.  if they did they make original stories  characters and franchise s.  but they dont have the confidence it would sell.   thats why they take successful franchises  games and movies stand on their success and name recognition and push the message with a rewrite or reimagining of the story and characters for a modern audience.so people dont get upset because of race swapping  its the changing the lore race or gender of an established beloved character for no other reason than woke bs.  fans would have the same issue if the next blade movie was asian. its not race it character story and established lore. this companies are rewriting history not unlike any communist country  i.e. china in 1949. teardown statues  rewrite history  movies etc... its always starts with division of citizens and real or conjured injustices.  I wish gamers would use their wallets as the message to these companies to stop. until it hurts their bottom line they will continue.
simple...is there a white dude ...are there straights in there is there a good story does the character stay in character and dont randomly act differently if you answer yes you know what will change
they re make the game about a female sam fisher or make his daughter the main character
updating for a modern audiences  means move on  it ain t for you anymore!when dc did the new 52 back in 2011 Imoved on to other things and never read touched anything dc going forward  still enjoy pre2011 dc .
ouch watching the steelers lose also  get kenny pickett in there
the comments on the reddit thread were hilarious  until one of the douchebag moderaters stepped in and shut it down. my faith in humanity was restored for a while  d  people know what s up  we all just get censored out
they could remove all characters except sam.. its the gameplay that matters. why not update controls  and graphic and roll it out.
well  some mfs did make the army woke  wouldn t be surprised if they d make war woke too!https   www.youtube.com watch v miygfsonkbk
changing for modern audiences aka changing it for people who dont even play video games and wont buy their product.
ubisoft as a franchise has gone down hill so much
the title of this video alone has me dying.  gotta give this one a watch for sure.  what will happen in woke splinter cell  does sam fisher s daughter attend college  dye her hair green  discover that with her father being part of the imperialist american patriarchal war machine  she must become a terrorist  change the stereotype that  muslims are the bad guys . she will instead show the world that women can be strong and independent  prove that even white women can be terrorists  ruin things for the men in america after being exposed to the tiniest amount of feminist indoctrination  or will sam using his stealth skills unlock the capitol doors on jan 6th  further help in the provocateured set up which happened that day.
Im renaming ubisoft  to ubersoft  as there s no testosterone in that company.is every game studio  based in sad fadcisco  would explain alot...
so splinter cell finally gets a new title and we find out  its a rotting skinsuit with a bunch of corporate wokes trying to fit in it.  lovely.  back to the originals I go to enjoy the superior times gone by all over again.
we have grimsdottir  who s a woman ... uh oh  here comes the  did you just assume carbon units gender    crowd.
sprinter cell director requirements... be poc  female  a activist  progressive  people from lgbt will receive special considerations   no gaming experience required
noooooo! nothing is safe from these lunatics! also you are a gorgeous female  lol
ubiscum have no appreciation for good old red storm entertainment that tom clancy started back in 1997...I still play their og titles to this day rbs98  rogue spear   rvs   expansions  gr island thunder   graw  sc123 which stand the test of time because they all have a dedicated old time fan modding communities and the foremost reason I will never give yves   his entourage of money gouging thugs at fun genocidal sweatshop another cent of my expendable income.here are some recent gameplay mods https   www.youtube.com watch v m5jaxt670mg t 204shttps   www.youtube.com watch v f-0pz9oerro t 1s
a series of games that just started 20 years ago - abandoned 10 years after -  updated for  modern day audience . smells like another recipe to throw money away and blame the demographic it wasn t directed to for the failure.
hey melonie good video thoughts on games like spider-man ps4 and ultimate spider-man game on ps2
as a long time player. of the splinter call games. this is disappointing. but not surprising.  just look at what they did to beyond good and evil 2. how d that go
yeahhh watch them change sam to samantha fisher as well
the fact of the matter is  nobody will stop buying their games but a minority. the majority wont care  they ll still buy it and these companies wont suffer.
how the duck does splinter cell need to be  updated for modern audiences    this isn t a gta or saints row where they crack jokes at everyone s expense  this is a stealth series with a serious story. the only thing they re saying is that they re going to openly push far left politics in the game. this is ridiculous.and Im putting money on the main character being a black samantha fisher that has  transitioned .
urgh its going to be samantha fisher isn t it
why are you tripping and jumping to conclusions   exploring characters  does not indicate a  woke  agenda. throughout the series we got attached to the characters and they may simply dive into their personal life more.
where is this modern audience  they never seem to show up to the things catered to them.
great theyre changing a franchise for the woke crowd who wont even play the game!
I kinda think splinter cell was ruined when they didn t bring michael ironside back in the last game. rebooting the franchise with a woke neoliberal agenda just adds insult to injury.

I thought ubisoft were running out of cash  they dropped splinter cell vr due to needing to save money and their master plan is splinter cell woke edition  good bye ubisoft!
changing for modern audiences  is a stupid phrase. the success of highly popular works of fiction is because they contain compelling characters and stories thatstood the test of time regardless of when they came out.
well thats doa
was splinter cell particularly offensive  I dont remember anything cancel culture would have to complain about unless the mc being a white guy is a problem. I dont recall any internet controversy  splinter cell was just one of those old espionage games people remember playing. its not like sam fisher was secretly a racist radical  he was just a guy doing his job for his country and sometimes for his family. what even is there to change besides maybe going back to actual stealth games that actually punished you for being reckless.
splinter cell is one of my all time fav games. I played the originals back in the day. the woke keep taking platforms with a pre existing fan base. to change it with the woke trash. Im more than happy to not play the game  support them and give them my money. because if they go as far as removing sam fisher. then its not splinter cell and shouldn t be called as such. I bet one of the big moves they will make. are changing the criminals in the game. move away from middle eastern and central south american crime organization. because you know thats racist even though its true. it helps the woke to ignore it as long as they dont think about it. so they can point the finger at the evil they want to focus on. which right now is russia and white trump supporters. it wouldn t surprise me one bit if they came up with a criminal organization and called them the red hats . idk what they expect from doing this imo and as a og gamer. splinter cell back in the day wasn t for everyone. because of the heavy stealth aspect. this game wont appeal to the modern generation. they are worse than ever before  they like fortnight and minecraft with zero attention span. need instant gratification and only have about a 2-5 minute attention span. they are just going to ruin a classic. why cant canada just figure out you cant label something that isn t the original and expect the same out come. canadian bacon is a perfect example
how does a guy mac on miss mac lol
what I dont get is  why do this with a remake  the story and characters should be set. at best you update graphics  sound and polish the gameplay. why not make a separate new game that contains all your aspects for  modern audiences   oh right  that would require effort...Im already opposed to this whole remake remaster bullshit going on  basicly milking nostalgia with minimal effort and rarely producing good results. this just confirms my opinion on that nonsense and aaa publishers developers as a whole.
youre really coming off as delusional just cause a few triggering words. my interpretation of  modern audiences and  new generation  are new mechanics because the original games are clunky by today s standards  making it more accessible to a wider and less hardcore audience  more in depth character development possibly  probably a more action based story rather than stealth based on the more recent games. nothing about this article has any indication about a woke agenda. all this article says is they are either planning on a hard or soft reboot for the franchise. if youre going to judge something  base it on facts and for the actual game itself  not your insecurities.
I dont want to jump the gun on this by already proclaiming it  woke .perhaps they simply mean making the game more relevant in terms of modern day global political climate  which admittedly has changed since early 00 s.but hearing   modern audiences   anytime a classic ip is getting brought back does make itsound sus.
sam fisher literally had a black boss and a woman telling him what to do. why do they feel they need to update it
he will become samantha fisher lol
I wont play thatshhit if sam fisher is not doing missions
he s gonna find out that there is a female sam fisher in the world who is better than him in every way while dealing with his sexuality after finding out she s transsexual
woke doesnt sell..
not splinter cell!!! nooooooo
companys need to stop catering to people who dont buy their shit to start with
samantha fisher heading our way
boycott ubisoft
why they tryna castrate us
what about staying closer to what made it a success or loyal to its tom clancy s root. instead of going full woke.
ac did this with ac 4
yeah  I agree with you  they might change the geopolitical part of the game  but why call it a remake when it is not a remake but a reboot or reimagining of the original  however  lots of people hear the modern audience part of the interview  and the conclusion is made because of prior ips going for modern audiences.
thats a possibility optimism is still important
splinter cell reboot  the only game where you take control of an international alphabets master rainbow pooping unicorn pc spy!snake can hold my beer!
this kind of thing makes me really nervois about the new mass effect game coning out
unisoft  black ops you say
well why dont people go and apply on the site for the job I did. we can hope one of us wll get it
they already gave you a black co-op partner in blacklist. what more do they wanna do this time  make sam fisher black himself
so sam is going to be samantha and is a crosdressing women
so the main character will be a  they  whoohoo!
go woke go broke.
they make the game just like last of us 2.
changing for a twitter audience.
y all getting mad at stuff you made up in your heads
boycott ubisoft
I ll bet if you look closely under the hood  you ll find anita sarkesian.
searching for a script writer  anita sarkeesian has entered the chat.they mean diverse as in gay and gayer.
the triple a gaming is dead... has been for many years.
retrogaming its the waay lets go
noooooooooooooosay it ain t so!
probably will write sam out.
oh no  not sam fisher!
facts. all Ive been playing lately  Im over it with new games
sam s gonna be bisexual and lambert is gonna be his male love interest  one of the other characters is gonna be trans and there gonna have some dialogue about blm
gg  thats why other companies are better lmao.
well they are one on the loss their  modern audience  does not exist and they do not buy games..... they will just end up losing their current audiences and fans and then they will be stunned why their games are not selling that much.... updating for modern audience     a product to avoid and company to avoid  sad thing is that it will take them few years to figure out that. o well it is good indies are still there...
I often play females in games when given the choice. but I swear to God if they gender swap sam to a woman someone is going to get hurt.
they mean catering to people who wont buy the game and wonder why the lose money. I hope they dont try to revive some of the games I loved as a kid and do this.
time to boycott ubisoft
this is exactly why I hate remasters and remakes  this is what happens. not surprised.
yha I never care about all this and Im black but my issue is how they present these issues with race and gender equality and how they target it is what really kills it for me. like really I dont know who s more racist the entertainment world or the people in it that thinks they need to add someone people can relate to to make things work like movie s   tv shows and video games. Imean thats fine but dont blame all that if everything you make sucks and blame fans over it just like the she hulk writers are doing.  like how would women feel if tomb raider got replace and got switched to a black man or asian men like they wouldn t like that right cause well anyone can do the role of park core or like to read past stories and see if we can use it to help better our future.
splinter cell was dead the moment the original va for sam fisher  michael ironside  was replaced. so I was done with splinter cell since then.
I dont think Ive pirated a game since the 80 s on c64  with all this shit they keep releasing maybe its time to start again if for no other reason than to sit and laugh at the insanity!
samantha fisher incoming.
ubisoft   u be soft lol
yeah  you dont need to remind me
anytime I hear  modern audience  I ignore them and buy something else. wont be getting gta 6 because of it
going from south park to woke is a long jump. they will probably block the old south park games like they did with other games anyway.  I will probably stop buying from them for a long time
but we know the woke crowd wont be buying this game
most splinter cell fans I talk to.... myself included.... dont actually want another game because modern day ubisoft isnt capable of making a good splinter cell.... its just a fact at this point.
hey  I haven t played splinter cell
leave my boI sam alone!!!!
why cant they just create a new game   2022   where franchises go to die .
sam fisher is now samuel l. fisher.
@melonie mac go boom
modern audience   those who dont even play or appreciate the series.
yeah  dont remind me
what s the outro song
you gotta be kidding me
saints row said the same thing.
zoomercell
remaking  robooting  reimagining and continuing the past is ayds and cancer.
game is doa to me. any company that goes woke is doa to me.
they re gonna make grimmsdottir black because she is a ginger for sure.
p          a          I        n
lol ubisoft torontoI have no faith in anything coming out from the creative minds in toronto.
sam is short for samantha.
at least they dont own metal gear solid  and we ll always have the original sc s.
when will these companies learn to stop hiring activist s and cater to the 97 percent of normal people in america. we re living in clown world
I think they will gender swap sam fisher and will get sandra fisher instead.
woker cell
if they wanna do that  create new ips. why screw up already established ips with this agenda
you mean  going broke
r.i.p splinter cell!bright side of this bullshit is that it came from a cute chick with tats.
melonie is so pretty
....special guest writer  anita sarkeesian.
dude  I bet ubisoft is gonna do the  chick  thing and make  sam  either a man or a woman and you can pick  like in ubisoft s other stuff like assassin s creed ! !
its gonna be an all female cast.. lol
deep sigh why  where do they get these creative directors  writers  producers because none of them can seem to be creative or hold a good fictional narrative. none of them.
meet splinter woman jane doe  the new character that has taken over the series because gay characters are just step one of the change  with her side-kick agent codename w.h.i.t.e man that is the funny cannot do anything character in this universe. explore secret facilities that are run by suits that only think about the evil capitalism  and take all their gadgets to increase your stealth expertise. but most of al...pay off your student loans.
sam fisher will be pregnant with twins  the entire purpose of the game will be to sneak into a hospital to give birth to his babies   theybies  . his pronouns will be she her  oh  and he s gay!
couldn t we just have gotten a splinter cell collection instead of this  give it the masterchiefcollection treatment then call it good. I know... big ask.
lool its getting so difficult to be a fan of the og gameshow is splinter cell problematic now..
splinter cell has practically been done for a decade who are they kidding doing this lol not even modern warfare iI remaster could resurrect itself
hImelonie!!
go woke go broke .
bye sam... hello samantha.
then they need to hire me. I can write a good story that avoids turning people away from the franchise. if this industry keeps hiring activist hipsters  they wont last long.
grim is a redhead - we definitely cant have that in 2022.
cool tats btw
news flash the  modern audiences  they are trying to get dont care. they will not buy or play the game. so why push your already great fan base away in favour of losing a lot of money  surely they have seen all the woke garbage fail and all the problems it causes  so why fallow them down that path  goodbye splinter cell we shall always have that first game.
destroy their art too. desecrate and ridiucule them all. they are evii.
never played it  and now for sure never will.
noooooo nooooo nooooo nooooooo pls dont go woke and broke why
sam fisher becomes sam fister
samantha fisher coming soon! also  anyone catch the new hellraiser trailer  pinhead is now female ffs!
dead on arrival.
I feel like they ll change reddings either to a woman black or gay or mixture of all three
so sam fisher is going my go to be black  gay etc  lol
samantha fisher then hmm  God I hope not  but sadly in todays world it is a possibility.it also could just mean that the story they want should be more modern  and the characters remain the same. I never liked the idea thatsam s daughter must go thru the same shit her father have gone thru. sam would never allow that too happend ever.sarah fisher should have never been a big part in the story of splinter cell in the first place. she just dont need too be.killing of lamberd and involving sarah fisher into the story too much where when splinter cell never where splinter cell again sadly. blacklist is a good game but it isn t splinter cell anymore. chaos theory was the best and from then on it goes just downhill  with blacklist a little light of hope.
prepare for trash
we need people to stop giving a shit about  modern audience  and just make good stuff...woke stuff is awful...
you are cute as a button!
Im excited for kratos to be the overweight and empowered  trans-Goddess of peace  person of the night .
lore sam fisher black ops special agentubisoft update for modern audience sam antha  fisher black womxn specially autistic comrade
sam fisher is going to be a woman. Im calling it!
old audience dont bring new money that is the reason why they dont carekinda like phone carriers  all the freebies for the newbies the rest can eat dirt!
samantha fisher.  bet me.
they are catering to a small demographic who doesnt even play their game.
2 37  the game is being rebuilt with the snowdrop engine. are you sure its not the snowflake engine
new splinter cell.  sam fisher  a african american  part latinx  super soldier infiltrating key white supremicist militia complexes while struggling to pay off his student loan
alright a steelers fan
brie larson might become sam fisher and be the love of the daughter. Im kidding I hope.
sam.. is... mam....
Im thinking it ll be that lambert is rewritten as trans since they cant race swap him lol.
wack
dear God please no Im so upset
fuck. maybe it was better that it went the way of metal gear.
support indie developers that just want to make an enjoyable game! fck the fake woke corporate bs
update for modern audience so  america is bad now. and didn t the first game involve china in some capacity
oh  wait until they remake the hitman games and turn 47 into a purple haired blatass. instead of a cold calculating clone contract assassin like he actual is. take an established franchise and shit all over it. the mo of woke hollywood and video game development and publishing companies. splinter cell took place in 2004  pandora tomorrow was 2006  chaos theory in 2007.
oh my God  they keep destroying franchises.  I will not be buying any of it.
your script writer is no match for tom clancy. looks like the activists are in ubisoft
ehhhh well I was more of a metal gear solid guy anyway
9 52 sphincter cell gay ass theory
tom clancy s is turning in his grave I can guarantee you that!!
Imiss when xbox was rad.
why!!!!
is there any proof that this  new audience  cant appreciate a continuation of the original source material
this whole crap about making video games more  relatable  is bs.  I play games to escape reality  I dont want to see  me .   I am replaying the witcher  and woah!  he doesnt look or act anything like me in my real world.  go figure.
nooooooooooo  I survived this long by not caring about movies or tv shows but they found me  now my beloved sam is gunna get the joel treatment for being a straight white male. theres gunna be feminist talking points and bitter super lesbians and tokenism and incompetant males etc. im pissed lol
people are offended by the dark
quite simple  stop buying anything from ubisoft. problem solved. when they lose enough money they ll stop their wokeness.
pfff... unsurprising... I realy enjoyed chaos teory back in the day. tolkien   rings of powertom clancy   splinter cell s rewokea little history repeating
feel like I have to keep saying this over   over  remaster not remake!if you hear  remake  youre inviting some bullshit change of something you loved
samantha fisher
it probably has to do with the story and current global conflicts being too similerto  georgia  https   en.m.wikipedia.org wikI georgia_ country    to investigate the disappearance of two  cia  https   en.m.wikipedia.org wikI cia  officers    alice madison who had been installed in the new government of  georgian president  https   en.m.wikipedia.org wikI president_of_georgia  kombayn nikoladze  who seized power in a bloodless  coup d  tat  https   en.m.wikipedia.org wikI coup_d 27 c3 a9tat  following the assassination of his predecessor earlier in the year  and robert blaustein who was sent in to find her. fisher discovers both were murdered on nikoladze s orders by former  spetsnaz  https   en.m.wikipedia.org wikI spetsnaz  member vyacheslav grinko. further investigation soon reveals that the cia agents had discovered that nikoladze is waging an ethnic cleansing campaign across  azerbaijan  https   en.m.wikipedia.org wikI azerbaijan  with georgian commandos. in retaliation   nato  https   en.m.wikipedia.org wikI nato  forces enter azerbaijan  prompting nikoladze to go underground.
anything developed by ubisoft toronto is going to be terrible. watch dogs legion  far cry 6  and now splinter cell.
isnt     ironside   dead already
they will likely turn sam into a women who is black and change the story explaining she is their best and the old sam fisher either didn t exist or they will claim he was nothing in comparison to her.then she will act like a man and talk like a man  then they will change 3rd echelon into 4th echelon with an all female staff and agents because reasons  no need to explain because we are pandering to the woke mob on twitter.the story will essentially rewrite everything from the old games  make everything about how men rule the world and how they must smash the patriarchy by any means necessary. turn all the villain s into straight white men because reasons  no need to explain... no need to ask why either  they will let you know because rainbow reasons....
so which gender is sam fisher going to be... wtf
are they gonna make sam a non binary pronoun using they them and call itself samantha fishet. is it gonna get offended if the enemy misgender it. will it defeat the bad guys with canceling then lol I guess they didn t pay attention to saints row. hey saints ya may have competition soon
odd how all these ips became rich and famous but lose money trying to appeal to a larger audience. seems to me that this larger audience doesnt exist. so Imust conclude that all the remake crap has a different agenda than the one they speak of.
sams gonna be a transracial nonbinary genderfluid demi-pan polyamorus asexual masculine presenting non masculine person.
meh. I wasn t a fan of splinter cell anyway so they already weren t getting my money
changing for modern audiences . thats ok  I ll stick to indie games and games made by eastern european companies. gsc  warhorse studio s and render cube all produce fine games.
melonie mac go boom you ar so cute
I dont understand why they gotta tamper with the old classics. dont remake the first game and ruin the continuity  just make your own crappy sequel with the new mary-sue female lead  samantha fisher  so that we can atleast cling to the old classics. what is also so damn stupid is how they deem an ip  problematic  yet they still wanna exploit the inherent fanbase. make new shit ubisoft and stop shitting on your own legacy
was anything thats gone in this direction successful  movies  no.. games. no..I even saw hostess snoballs are white now and not pink
everything will be destroyed soon.netflix is bastardizing my favorite anime one piece
no and you better not manifest thatso shut it
@melonie mac go boom  ohh he s only 70. so he might well rasp along for a few still
trans female
can I customize my pronouns
im calling it. the main character is gonna be gay or pansexual or something or make him female and or black.
yet another franchise is 6ft under rip splinter cell this is why nintendo rocks because they say f the wokies
they are gonna either gender swamp   or race swamp   or make him gay or gender fluid   always one of these 3.
aka will be bad
also passing the torch to sarah was and always will be a terrible fucking idea you cantake thatshit out back behind the shed
maybe after splinter cell they would reboot the metal gear solid series and have solid snake be a trans lady
solid snake   sam fisherchange my mind
I played so many hours of splinter cell.looks like I ll be skipping this one.if its made by those people it ll be bad and boring anyway.
Im gonna pirate it
they re coming after God of war next  kratos will be a member of the  lgbtq
its a game  if you dont like it dont play it. why bend to these people that get offended at a fictional character game. the world is screwed because of these snowflakes
done with this new generation of entertainment because thats solely all it is  to entertain the ideology in a corrupt oppressed mind society.
I think its obvious it will still be sam fisher ...samantha fisher a black female   and grim will be trans chr
I guess they should change the guns too  Imean who can afford those type expensive guns etc  they should be using more grouded   reliatic guns that you can buy at a cheap gun store...they do wnat to apeal to everyone yes  but I think the generatl public cant effoord all those expesive weapons.just as these people claim girls dont look pretty the gun too should also relefct that...they should only limit it to guns that everyone can efford...or maybe just use a pee shooter
another reminder why I stay retro. modern gaming is dead. mostly. indies are still releasing some stuff.
eh they ruined it in blacklist already
sc remake plot  sam fisher gonna be transgender black gay guy who battles  their  feeling and emotions.lambert and grim
rip splinter cell...... ubisoft has become ubisucks.
this will surely save splinter cell.
..
please dont ruin splintercell..... just give us chaos theory 2
splinter cell can kiss my ass now if it is going to go to the woke nonsense. please dont james bond fall to this next  please!
samantha fisher
Im not going to play that game
samantha fisher   they them  the first non binary trans woman black-ops soldier.
I just started the video so let me take a guess... sam fisher is transgender
youtube deleted my comment
samantha fisher
trans fisher.
3
what Im hoping it means  less blatant state department propaganda  more subversive ala metal gearwhat it probably means   we fit a climbable tower into nsa headquarters! dunno what everyone is on about with this freaking out about  woke stuff.  is anyone seriously expecting any sort of real attempt at social introspection from a franchise with tom clancy s name on it  what brainworns are you housing in your skulls
sam fischer will be apologizing to everyone. and then gets put in his place by female lesbian black character who also happens the be a doctor.
lol the steelers
oh for fuck sakes. another one to remove from my list.
we still use the word  woke  ....
modern audiences  dont have a clue who sam fischer is. this means sam will be a fat  pink haired  they them of color. all interest and hopes I had for a new splinter cell  just went the way of last night s taco bell.
changing for an audience that never played our games. great move. another failure on the way.
so sams a woman
also I dont know why they keep saying modern day audience  I dont know a single person who likes this kinda stuff and it always tanks.  what audience      the 0.002  of angry bitter sjws
I said the same thing about wildlands 2. we got breakpoint  a prophetic moniker.
so what word you will use to describe this
sooooo.......samantha fishers trans journey and  her  fight against bigotry in the armed forces -both foreign and domestic.
why would you get initially excited for a splinter cell remake before it was announced it was going woke  hasn t nobody learned that old video games remade rebooted for current day almost certainly spells disaster! just leave the old stuff alone and make new characters and worlds. so lazy and still shocked how many dummies shell out full price for  modern  gta trilogy  mass effect  the last of us etc.
splinter cell died in a new york basement in 2006. 2010 was the funeral.
cant wait to play as sam fisher the empowered indigenous trans bi-quadsexual deerkin black woman.
sam fisher is actually a muslim transgender and was called samira fisher in the past
whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy     . seriously stop pandering to the few who make the most noise.  update the control scheme not the actual themes!
splinter cell conviction didn t have ironside either.  its all so pathetic. sony studios is now based in san francisco. imagine the woke garbage they re going to put out in the coming years. we might see another gaming crash if it keeps up like this.callisto project it is
is lara croft going to be a trans  man  next
here we go again with this  toxic masculinity  bullshit
the villain will be based on trump... book it
spinter gay.........
sam fisher will become an overly emotional man  and or a woman  and or black  and or trans. Im sure you can be all those things at once anyway.
sam is gonna be a purple hair male soy feminist that is vegan and against guns lol
watch them pull a hey in this version sam fisher is going to be a black guy thats also a homosexual.
dead on arrival!  ubisoft games are dead on arrival incarnate
what are they changing exactly    is he a transvestite now
sam fisher is now a  black transgender man!
jumping to fucking conclusions too early. not that I trust current day ubI  but saying this means going woke is just dumb. and no  I am not current day audience either  splinter cell fan of the first hour here  1978.  doesnt sound like they re gonna change the characters drastically. probably just gonna change geopolitical details of the story  ergo  trying to not offend the chinese  tencent ubisoft .
well this sucks ass   im 40 so I have played the older games witch I loved . I tried blacklist but after 5min of it I stopped playing it because I dont like how you can go loud or stealth   I liked having to sneak around in the shadows . I even bought the ps3 remastered version thats how much I liked the olders games that I replayed both
how shitty there was no reason for this.
I know I am late to this but if they torpedo this with this political correctness  I will not buy the game. the franchise with have ended at blacklist.
oh no there going to make sam fisher gay since he s epitome of masculist toxicity
its quite simple. update the controls  the sound  the graphics but dont touch the story or dialogue- or I wont buy it. get woke................go broke.
I hope they dont make a female lead. lara croft is enough  no need for any more of this tough girl nonsense.
grimm is gonna be a lesbian   wlkes is gonna be race or gender sword and lambert is gonna be a trans black woman to honor that fuckin weirdo admiral we got representing us overseas now
can we all just stop going woke ffs who the hell likes these things      who      npcs
get woke go broke I really hope sam fisher doesnt become a gay-bI non-binary protagonist because og fans like myself will say hell no to this idea. instead of trashing a franchise why cant these writers just make up their own rip off franchise to hit on  oh thats right because they have no creativity.
samantha fischer
you jumping to  woke  when they say modern audience says more about you then anything lol.
just play the orginal game not the modern dumbed down version
splinter cell has always sucked imho
ffs
steelers  boooogo ravens!!
if you ask me melanie this whole wont crap sucks but thats okay let them remake that woke-ass piece of crap I got the originals I got the trilogy plus splinter cell blacklist
damn I hate this crap
so basically you made this whole video and didn t say absolutely nothing  I didn t hear not one thing you said that tells me that the game is going woke. just a bunch of assumptions and when you assume you make an ass out of yourself.  they modernized resident evil one  two    3 remake and about to do the same thing for resident evil four remake. did you say the same stuff about those games are those games woke  what about final fantasy 7 remake that was modernized is that woke
michael ironside cant come back dude is too old and far from healthy.
so  the question is  will sam now be black handicapped trans female  or will he end up being the racist   fascist bad guy
sam fisher s half black lesbian daughter will be fighting trump supporters in wisconsin.
absolute click-bait video. the original game took place in 2004. so much has changed in 20 years. tech  social media  etc.its like if they wanted to adapt  hunt for red october   they d have to change shit because the ussr doesnt exist anymore.
I hope they do it just so you can go follow that arabic saying
right  she s so annoying with her whole antI woke thing she has going on atm
@sad satan  it honestly probably means they are going to make it more cinematic or update the gadgets or something. the original splinter cell games basically had no story and modern audiences wouldn t want to experience it like that now. but its cooler to hate women I guess
thats the spirit. a lot of these franchises are already long-running and dont need a woke entry to have a sense of progression or completion. and I ll bet you the new mass effect game will be exactly the same. just you watch  people will go back to the original trilogy and say thats mass effect  end of story.
all they need is his voice  no reason he cant do that lol
@melonie mac go boom  there was a reason why he has reduced his voice work over the years. you dont put an old man s voice on a character that is supposed to be 42. even he has admitted it. especially  if they are bringing the series back. how long do you suppose he could do voice work for ! he s 72.
but putin exist
so  boring like tomb raider reboot
no thanks lol.  soon as sjws or woke gets involved im out 100 .  I just move on  0  chance this wont be awful.
sam fisher is going to be a black jewish woman
so  the dude fights for esg and electrical vehicles and shit  he wants to bring down capitalism and usher in a golden era of universal basic income I hope its as entertaining as the dumpster fire thatsaints row 2022 has been.
I hope it flops.
love you girl  but the steelers suck
modern gaming sucks
I swear you guys lol. company with fictional story ip  we change some things  mac boomers  keep the gays  colored people out of my video games.
I prefer playing old retro games modern games sucks and mostly boring
oh my goodness  this is probably the second comment Im leaving on this subject  but leave my sam fisher the f    alone! all you woke developers  go create your own diverse video game characters  your own story and produce your own game! stop piggybacking off of the greats! use that imagination of yours  oh wait  you cant! because you know your ideas suck  so you have to ruin already existing amazing work.
I love splinter cell. but I wont play this if its full of woke nonsense. I dont know who they think this  modern day audience  is  like 1  of the population  most people detest woke. good job ubisoft you absolute clowns. I hope the game flops.
youre so annoying with this  woke callout shtick  you have going on atm
ps5 sucks
if the story is being modernize it automatically makes it woke  lol what an absolute asinine assumption to make when mw 2019 had its story modernized did you call it woke  its called an alternate timeline no wokeism reeeeeeee
get over it. diversity and inclusion are here to stay. but it is funny to see people like you cry about it.
you have not seen the show...or even played the original games...so what do you know  ms football
I absolutely played the original games back when they came to ps2  splinter cell is my second favorite franchise. did you miss the part at the intro where I said  long time fan   lol!
@melonie mac go boom  lol just making sure
