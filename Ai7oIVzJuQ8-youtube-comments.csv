the petition to have her completely removed from the film is at over 4 million signatures now.  its becoming more and more evident how manipulative she has been from the start.  we have the same thing with birds at my house.  we have houses in the backyard  but all the birds seem to like building nests in the plants.you seem really refreshed from your time off.  great to see you back!
agree  they needed to recast her for aquaman 2. also throw in ezra for the flash as well  needs a recasting. since they check off the correct boxes  they are treated differently. glad you are back melonie! enjoyed the fishing pictures!
she should been fired from the film. johnny lost fb and potc. welcome back melonie.
they just should have done the reshoots recast using emilia clarke  as mera  as was suggested by many.   clarke and mamoa have terrific chemistry having worked together on got.  once again  not smart on the part of wb.  welcome back  as you can see throughout the chat  you were missed!!!  terrific view from the boat and your curly raven hair - looks amazeballs.
the real reaction evil has in the presence of God  14 25  instead of what is portrayed in hollywood. keep up the great work  ms melanie!
welcome back! we missed you. also. she should be fired and never have work in hollywood again for what she s done. Ive watched the entire trial  and this woman is the epitome of madness.
welcome back  melonie! Im glad you had a nice vacation. good job catching the fish! how many rupees did you get for it   most of my fishing was done in the legend of zelda  ocarina of time  so thats where my mind went I was just thinking today about how annoying it is that amber heard is playing mera  because I love mera in the comics. she was awesome in the blackest night event. I wish they d just recast her instead of diminishing her role.also  this is the first time Ive seen a Bible verse reaction video.
I absolutely refuse to watch the movie unless she is removed completely.  if she is shamed publicly in the credits or in the film itself  I will be a fan for life.
welcome back  mac! I was at my parent having devotions  which we do quite often these days  and my dad was reading this exact chapter to us. just thought that was interesting to note. anyway  glad to have you back!
personally speaking with the way they treated johnny depp and basically destroyed his career over mere allegations. I think that amber heard s role should have been cut as well. they could easily have replaced her character and nobody would have batted an eye. lol
good on you for taking a break. its easy to get caught up in the grind and never really take time off. this leads to exhaustion and burnout. God instructed us to have a day of rest for a reason.glad youre back though!
they definitely should have recast her  as there are some who would do much better at the role as well.  taking a break from creative pursuits is helpful from time to time.  it can be feel strange getting back into them at first  but you ll get your groove back in no time.
welcome back and coming back strong too. now regarding wb  too little too late. people were telling them for years about her and they kept doubling down. they deserve whatever they get.
mac is back! my daily cardio wasn t the same without your videos.if you think about it  this is some pretty wishy-washy stuff from the studio. we know her contract was optioned  so warner bros could have taken a definitive stand from the very beginning. but instead they decided to sit back and see how the winds would blow. if the response to her seemed favorable  they were the good guys who stuck by her  and if not  they could reduce her role to minimize fan backlash. I can understand the business decision while at the same time pointing out how spineless it is.also  that character is a complete throwaway anyway  they could have just cut her out entirely from the beginning and not had to ever take a stand.
that pig farmer must have been so pissed after loosing all his pigs. I d like to see a comedy skit on that. pleasure to see youreturn and glad you had good time off. and I d like to thank you for introducing myself to g-fuel. its the only energy drink in few truck stops that doesnt have all the crap in it.... and just water gets boring when over the road.
there is a mtg card that quotes part of this passage.also Ive been possessed itstarts off with what I would call amplified feelings  mostly in the anger  frustration dept. it is hard to think for yourself because you are having two minds at once until it takes over.
Im hearing rumors she s been fired and cut from the film entirely.  you could make an argument thatshe s already done three movies if you count zack snyder s justice league as a separate film since she did record new dialog and footage for it.  about 18 years ago  my family had birds living in the bush by our garage but some things happened and they sadly died.  I wont go into the details because I dont want too upset people too much.
hImelonie  glad to see you survived a fishing trip without obvious sunburn lolif only we all could be so lucky.
Im little curious of the lara croft figures you have in the background. I happened to find neca made legends lara and bandaI toybiz angeline jolie bikergear lara figures few weeks back and I got curious about whether or not you collect all kinds of tomb raider merch or just specific kinds  if its a lot have you made a video about them  Im always on the look out for cool stuff so would be neat to see what is out there
the  verse of the day  is back in the menu!!!!!!!also welcome back mel!!hope you enjoyed this week with your family
ole ezra needs to sit down in prison for a while
@chris m  he s assaulted so many women and the alphabet community lets him get away with it. the dude gives off buffalo bill vibes ffs.
I agree
now that you mention it I think emilia clarke would have been a far better choice from the get go.she s likable as hell and more than cute enough to get butts in seats. she can also act with the right material and direction.
@max  and no more of amber s hacky fake british accent
@damage_case138  yes  good riddance to that too. but to be fair  its the least fake thing about her.
ever seen a pitbull dachshund mix  absolutely hilarious. my friend s brother has one named puddin . she s dachshund sized proportioned  but built like an extremely muscular pitbull. and she is strong.
welcome back  I was worried I was missing your videos  glad you were just on a break! I enjoyed the first aquaman movie  but I thought that amber heard added nothing to that role. not sure if she wasn t used to acting with a green screen or  as we ve seen with the trail  she s just a bad actress. easily replaceable to the audience!
we missed ya  melonie
hey melonie I just want to tell you that welcome back home and I hope you had a great visit with your family and I really like your picture of you with your fish that you caught on your boat. anyway I  just want to tell you and say that amber heard should have been ban from playing her role of the aqua man movie and she should have been questioned for her actions with relationship with johnny depp and been asked if she attacked him or if he attacked her and then have a lie test to see if she was telling the truth and have johnny depp tell the truth too. anyway I just want to tell you that I think that this whole issue between amber heard and johnny depp is a joke and itshould never be shown on television and on internet  ok melonie. anyway I just want to make a comment about this amber heard and johnny depp issue and I just want to say that amber heard should not get a role part for aqua man movie  ok melonie. anyway I hope you had a great day today at gym and at home and I do hope you continuing to have a wonderful and great blessed evening at home with your pets and have a good night too melonie.
cant we just see her death scene in flashpoint paradox
welcome back melonie! Ive always liked mera long before the movies. I am a bitsad annoyed thatshe will be associated with amber to a lot of people.
I feel like this is the only time Im gonna allow myself to be a simp  and thats for my favourite youtuber. welcome back melonie     3
welcome back!!! well deserved break and loving the hair!
good to see you back  my friend. hope you enjoyed your time with your family.
slay the spire is fun  good to run through and unlock the other characters and do the challenges
welcome back  melonie mac!  hey that rhymes. . .! I know it wasn t all that long  but glad youre back and going strong!
missed your videos but good for you for taking a break.
the role now goes to miss mel.
welcome back  hope the recharge did you well. when we gonna see this meta pc in action   d
from a business aspect I get their decision. it would take millions of dollars recasting  reshooting  etc. they cut her part down significantly and she is basically exiled from hollywood  which is what we all wanted.
good video melonie.  loved the pictures and the verse.
johnny never layed a finger on her so why must he go to jail  he went away from amber never once did he strike her. Ive been abused too and when thatstuff happens the best you can do is try to get away from the situation. unless you were referring to ezra than I apologize lol but yeah ezra and amber need some jail time
its so weird that they recast amber I feel that the production want the bad reputation from her just to have a lot more views and free promotion because being known for something bad automatically makes you more popular that is what I believe....
the mac attack is back! even though it was unplanned glad you got to unplug and refresh yourself. that being said super excited to have you back creating good quality content and hair looks fantastic.
there was definitely a demon loose in buffalo the other day. good to see you back!
great to have you back
glad ur back safe and sound mel!
melonie mac to play mera on next aquaman film
glad you had a good break. keep rockin
I am writing this to help out melonie mack and this video and this channel with the algorithm
camille is dominating amber heard in this  she s using a strap on made of evidence and no lube
the silly multiverse concept makes itso easy to replace psycho actors.  I dont know why its a problem.
good  this shows that the people really do rule the world  when we decide something thats it nothing the ones in charge can do  this we decided we dont like her and thus they realize we wont pay for stuff with her in it
hello melonie your hair style is fabulous.you deserve well deserved break  takecare melonie
you would think cutting someone s finger off would lead to prison time.
it was so funny when people wanted snoop dog and other men to rather play mera than amber turd lol
she could be re-cast with mark zuckerburg and it would still have the same emotional and authentic delivery
yay  melonie mac is back!
melonie! your hair looks amazing
I dont think she should have lost her role over this...
I assumed thatshe found a real tomb to raid! haha
8 46 - not gonna lie  I think you look even better with little to no makeup.but I would agree that you look more glamorous with. beautiful either way  of course.  ps  striped bass
9 31 - seriously !I thought that was just white hat  green sharpie melonie  bravo!I thought you bought it like that!
wow I am here to admire that awesome hair of yours. keep up the good work
its good to see you back
she mentioned tomb raider again.. from reading the Bible. lol
yes your right about demons revealing themselves would prove God s existence and another thing that proves it is the existence of giants which has also been greatly covered up because the Bible mentions them as well.
verse of the day comment  legion is the egregor of anonymous. alan moore practices goetia and made a pact  as revealed in a postal interview conducted by my friend for his uk fanzine. so ... yeah.
give her some red hair and melonie could be mera.
welcome back melonie..great vacation and family pictures....here is a verse thatsupports your demon point leviticus 17 7 esv   36 helpful votesso they shall no more sacrifice their sacrifices to goat demons  after whom they whore. this shall be a statute forever for them throughout their generations.
welcome home  glad you enjoyed your time away!
the dude Jesus delivered lived among the tombs...so he was an early goth  on a serious note  I agree with your takes completely about demon possession.
they should put ezra and amber in a cell the winner gets to keep their career
I hope your trip was good.
yay! our favorite gamer girl is back. all hail the queen  p.s. love the yellow top.
thats 10 minutes too much. she should have 0 minutes of screentime.
literally any actress besides amber heard would be better as mera at this point. they could even bring back elena satine from that one episode of smallville.
I love the curly hair ur a beautiful women good personality love the tattoos to keep doing your thing
I hear that carrot top is available  if they want to replace heard as mera.
hair game on point.
glad youre back
your hair looks really good like that!
I would rather see johnny depp in another good pirates of the caribbean movie than see amber heard canceled from aquaman 2.the thing is  everything about her is known now  she canceled herself  but johnny is not uncanceled yet. instead petitioning wb to get rid of her  we should petition disney to reinstate him.
its good to see a little of your life
its been great to see her reputation be rightfully destroyed by this trial!
I hear what you are saying about actors. but I believe if an actor singer public figure has to share their political view  it will influence many people who will believe it hook line and sinker. plus they will not research for themselves the veiws  of persons running for any office. so I will not give any of my hard earned money to anything they are in. just my humble opinion. oh welcome back  glad you had down time and could unconnect. also  till your nephew gets alittle bugger and you start spoiling him!
I dont think giants are only mentioned in the Bible. they are popular in other mythologies too. so they could end up proving something that the Bible is loosely based on.
@fortunefxgmr  although the Bible is the one magnificent book where many of the things mentioned even the miracles have been proven factual. when I was referring to the giants  it was discovered that in ancient america and other countries around the world they located hundreds of giant skeletons  some as big as over 32 feet tall.
@lennybreeze23  odd  I dont remember most miracles being proven factual. I think I did hear about jericho  possibly. but I thought many of the other miracles were still theoretically possible based on aligning celestial events or such. and none of it proving miracles of the Christ during his earthly ministry.
im hoping by the time aquaman 3 comes around they  Imust go now  my home planet needs me  her.
first!!!
alternately  mila janovich rocks a red wig  and  andie macdowell speaks dolphin.
having someone s reputation destroyed  apart form putin is not great.  if melonie mac is in bussiness she canteach amber heard to be a gamer girl  since she will have no job
anyone else think amber heard and ezra miller would be perfect for each other  it would be a glorious trainwreck.
welcome back! glad you had a nice vacay with fam.
demons 100  are out there among us
your hair is fantastic!
resume the boom! I have no comment on amber turd. Imean heard.
funny how you worked your way through the movie industry for years and finally land a huge role just to be ruined in a few court sessions. I guess you truly have to be a decent person to survive hollywood.
the media is still backing her despite the fact that the longer this goes on the more we learn how terrible she is  but I will agree with them on this one thing  that the outcome of the trial will effect victims of da going forward  but just not how they claim  as they keep pushing and pushing that only women are victims  what this trial will change moving forward is the ability for male victims to come forward against their abusers  and that women that make false claims are to face consequences
canthey cgI all her scenes out
have you ever read  the screw tape letters  I believe c.s. lewis wrote it. great book of how lewis believed demons work against Christians.
8 34 yo! thats a sweet catch!  pun intended!  yeah  you can call it fishy if you like lololololololol! sorry  got too many waves of dad jokes on a line . . . .
I like a lot of movies because actors are entertaining. the actors personal opinions are mostly garbage and Im sure in real life they are detestable. in abs case  she s a criminal and abuser and should be held accountable. I will not watch am2 unless they remove her. however  jd is supposed to be in sherlock holmes 3 and I will be paying to see it.
I dont think wb understands the real and permanent damage they did to their brand by firing jd without evidence of any wrongdoing  simply on the word of 1 female...and not firing ah when there was is plenty of evidence thatshe has done plenty of wrongdoing.I dont care if they remove her completely....I still wont ever give my money to wb ever again.  they showed their true colors already.  the only reason they are cutting down her role now is because they realise they are going to lose a lot of money.  they have no conscious  no soul... literally!
the boom is back!
I too enjoyed the first aquaman movie. I feel this shouldn t effect my opinion on the movie itself. tons of decent people worked hard to make it.
welcome back!
finally! now they just need to fire and replace ezra. heck  they should also cancel the flashpoint movie all together and start from scratch. it just looks like a total disaster already.
so to watch the aquaman 2 thatshould have been  I need to travel to an alternate reality where her role wasn t cut down  and there s more content in the film.right got it.  honestly its sad how one person can ruin a movie . I bet I would have enjoyed mera fighting some look alike. at the end of the day  this is entertainment and is being ruined by someone s selfish agenda. listen fam  I cant pay for movies because my parents are business people and are really tight with money  piracy is my only option. and I watch everything for free  I dont even flinch when torrenting and some shows people are picky about Im not. to me aquaman 2 being ruined is just very sad. if amber heard wanted money  she should have just continued acting. I know its embarrassing to be worth almost nothing  but a divorce nets you 7 million dollars  and you feel like you ve accomplished nothing  but ocme on  or worse she could have been a twitch streamer.   if amber heard where a cat woman esque diamond theif  and going into crypto heists  I would say yeah queen more power to you   but I cant get behind this abuse thing.
I think you better without makeup. I said this back on your old channel.
the character shouldn t be penalized and the story lessened. mera is a great comic book character. just get rid of the problem aka the actress.
Im so glad amber heard s role is reduced in aquaman 2  and also you are looking very cute and edible as usual lovable melonie.
when she is fired from aquaman I will think about watching it.  but if she isn t which is the most probable outcome then I wont watch it.
they couldve given jack sparrow a red wig and cast him as mera and I gurantee it would generate more money than this xd
amber doom herself with lies and ruin jhonny deep as well ...hope justice come upon her
hey  where can I get slade the spier  oh wait  you said steam! thanks  d
missed you!
good too see you again
boom!!
oh no she lost job opportunities  thats just too bad for her. hope everyone can detect my sarcasm.
go fish! yay!
breaks are good.  enjoy life
nope. johnny depp lost roles because of what she did. she lost roles because of what she did.
if anything good can come out of this  its to show that women can be domestic abusers too. I hope johnny s career gets back on track.
return of the mack

if she is looking for a job I have a few bits around the house she can do

top of your head is shiny!
ahh! holy hell! what have you done with melonie mac you imposter!  you cant fool me! are you one of the lizard people  did you steal her skin   12 40 oh... I see. a covert cry for help. too smart for those demons  I see.but seriously I dont know if its lighting  makeup  or sun tan... its not bad by any means. just different.
why are all women so crazy lol jk just most of them really lol jk oh man women right. oh not you mel your cool. wait dont take this the wrong way. Im just going to shut up now. Im in trouble aren t i. dang
amber heard and ezra miller need to go. reboot the damn franchise and put oddly acqua man s jason mamoa at the front of that train.
honestly  I couldn t care less about celebs!!! just saying
until she is completely removed from the movie I wont be watching it
I have no sympathy for amber heard. what goes around comes around.
its not too late to cast someone else! replace amber heard with sasha banks!
10 mins is to much for me warner can justify it all they want. I still hold them accountable boycott aquaman2.
I gotta say Im not loving this new look
why did u block me from twitter and instagram  did I hurt ur feelings  I thought u were a free speech warrior...
same
same
I know
