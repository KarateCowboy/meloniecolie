back in my day in the 90 s  I could never have thought I would see a time where colorblindness was no longer virtuous. its not that we were complacent with our victory over racism  we just expected the next generation to enjoy the world we helped shape and continue to improve it  rather than feel the need to create problems so they had something of their own to  fix  while in doing so make things significantly worse.
you nailed it with   when we cant find racism  we create it.  who wakes up in the morning and thinks to themselves   how can I virtue signal on twitter today
when we cant find racism  we create it.  - the modern woke left. this has the same amount of cringe as that npr article about choosing skin color in emojis.
growing up in the late 70 s early 80 s I was always taught that the best way to fight racism was to not see race at all and follow the golden rule when dealing with others. Ive lived my life as best I can according to that. these days Im called a horrible person because I refuse to see race  I also refuse to use  preferred pronouns  as if someone else s ideas should be imposed on me  but mine are summarily ignored . Im not  old and out of touch  but I feel like it because I just dont like a lot about our current world and dont understand how we got here having 6 billion labels for everyone and walking around on egg shells so you dont say something that get s you  cancelled   when the answer is so obvious to me. stop using 6 billion labels for everyone and dont be a dick. just like I was taught when I was young. it literally is thatsimple. elon cant get me to mars fast enough.
back in my day I was taught to treat people the way I would want to be treated. regardless of  skin color. but today people get offended over anything lol  even a funny gif smh love your vids  keep up the good work
oh  man  I have several little reactions today 1  the sjws have tried this  stop digital blackface  thing already  like  four years ago 2  hey  that reaction gif is uncle roger  a hilarious youtuber who critiques youtube chefs for their asian cooking being wrong.3  in an episode I watched recently  gothix did the  verse of the day  as well  and while  once upon a time  I would ve been upset at the proselytizing  Ive come to actually enjoy it.4  everything the sjws do is mirroring how boomers had their men s lodges and men s spaces  and their wives started to infiltrate and tear them apart as well. men aren t allowed to have their own places to exist any longer.
just like when they arbitrarily declared the okay hand gesture to be racist  they just ensured that Im gonna do it more. and I ll go out of my way to do it in front of them too. lol
I was born in 82  so my formative years were in the 90s as well. for my wife and I  it wasn t so much that we were told to not see skin color  its that no one really talked about it. so much of our entertainment intake prominently featured black people and no one was going around saying   youre going to watch thatshow about the black nerd or that ghetto kid who moved to bel air  you know youre not black... right   or anything like that. we watched and listened to everything and were never told we couldn t. it was a very post-racial upbringing and its circled back to the pre-civil rights era way of talking. and the people that were pushing it then are the same people pushing it now  but they ve put a fresh coat of paint on itso we wouldn t catch on.
we need to come to a point where we all need to start ignoring these kind of people because the attention is what keeps them going.
no matter what you try to do anymore  one of these beadles will come out of the woodwork to stop you  correct you  and point you in some other direction. bossing people around is an end in itself.
thanks for the Bible verses to be honest  Im collecting these everyday  really appreciate sharing your faith.
great video. the honesty of admitting your part in dudes not wanting to play video games with girls speaks to your Christian character. God bless you and your loved ones.  also btw  do you play any competitive games or mostly pve
melonie  youre the most awesome person on youtube  as far as Im concerned. your takes on the culture are passionate and yet so levelheaded  and your Bible verse segments are uplifting and so often you give the gospel clearly  which takes a lot of guts!! Im proud of the work youre doing on here  you ve been a huge encouragement to me   and youre absolutely right about the fact that God is in a sense present in the lives of unbelievers as well as believers  its a biblical concept usually referred to as God s  common grace . the most obvious example of common grace is the fact that God allows us life each day  and also each breath that he gives us. but he also blesses and has mercy on all us sinners  to give us all countless reasons to glorify him  even if most of us dont.the main verse I would think of to support the idea of common grace is matthew 5 44 - 45 but I say to you  love your enemies  bless those who curse you  do good to those who hate you  and pray for those who spitefully use you and persecute you  that you may be sons of your father in heaven  for he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good  and sends rain on the just and on the unjust. the implication is definitely that God is good to unbelievers as well as his children. it leaves them without excuse not to believe in him. a parallel verse to this would be luke 6 35 - 36praying for you! God bless!
if anything  I feel like using reaction gifs gives the ppl in them more exposure because I often see ppl asking  who is that   its what made me seek out the man behind the  emotional damage  meme.
complaining about something stupid like this will just make me do it twice as much as I didn t at all before
I swear I was never so exited to hear a friday night tights guest as when I heard you would be on next week. cant wait to see you vibe with the panel and bring a new perspective on. bless chrissie mayr for getting me to know you
I appreciate your commentary  and your verses at end are always encouraging
I knew a japanese woman that went to america and she said she thought america was open minded but was surprised to see everyone dividing themselves by gender and race.I had to explain the irony is people believe doing so is open minded and celebrating diversity.
if I use a Godzilla gif to answer anything  am I anti-lizard  I should find a  Godzilla deal with it  gif in response.
sigh Imiss the 90s and early 00s when if you had a problem you threw hands about it and the amount of dudes that are actually afraid to just talk to a female now is astounding
we had  racial sensitivity  training at work and many of us brought up the point that treating someone different because of their skin color was racism. a vocal few shouted us down as just being uneducated and the class moved on
idk I got called cracker a lot in school in the 90s. punched in the back of the head during a run-by crackering... welcome to the world we helped create.
God l miss the 90s.  back when life made sense
got a good point  I thought we had at least given the next gen a chance- but they hate us and each other in ways we could never have imagined.
my best friends were mexican and peruvian and we always laughed at our racial differences.  I d always say   yall be nice or ima conquer your house and make you slaves       we all laughed and they d snap back with the generic white boy stuff but not once did we ever see each other as different races ....  racism was laughed at in the 90s and it was the best
I think you know exactly who wakes up and thinks of this garbage...
exactly
that kind of person s entire morning should be a comedy of slapstick errors
11 03 they are under his grace until his judgement. God is the one true judge and we are his children. thus  to hold back our grace when we where given gace freely is to supersede his authority. a sinner  everyone  who was freely given grace forgiveness through Christ s sacrifice  yet withholds his own grace places himself herself back under judgment.others would say that he who is without grace is without Christ or that one has not truly accepted God s grace and thus is still without grace. a great gratitude towards grace is a pretty big sign of those in the spirit of Christ since it is literally the apex moment that everything changes.  as old things pass away and new things come.  - 2 corinthians 5 17I personally liked the new things and was happy to see the old die.
I second this motion.
@anvec  its because they didn t have anymore  great wars  to fight   so they ve been instructed in college to go back   rehash the past battles.its stupid   they are about to get b-slapped by reality.the universe will drop enough drama on your doorstep  you dont need to artificially create any.they kids will learn.
@purple pill philosophy  Imiss the 80s  when shit was fun!
@lion of the morning   both were.  1982-1999 was the high point of human civilization
@saimaidar  so do you believe that yurI bezmenov was telling the truth
@jigawatt 1.21  not really familiar with the name but have a friend who is a sociology professor and have talked to him about the subject as well as paying attention to a number of college professors that publish their views and give interviews as well as listening to college student lead protests for a few decades.
@saimaidar  he was allegedly a kgb agent that defected in the 70s I believe.  and he talked of the methods you mentioned in order to destroy a country from within.
@jigawatt 1.21  okay have heard of him but was not familiar with the name I am mainly just going on observations  discussions and reading and listening to various events and trends.
@saimaidar  look up his interviews.  he was warning people decades ago that this was all coming.
ikr  the world  especially america are sooo fucking obsessed with race its unbelievable. what happened to people just having fun in the 90s all the way up until like 2010  thats when it all went downhill. Im seeing so many teenagers onwards reacting to  racist  stories  or  conservative far right  videos or  homophobic transphobic ben shapiro  vids like why cant people just watch normal videos anymore without having to include race into every fucking part of it. the 90s was essentially worse for minorities yet 30 years later when its way way better we re so divided.
oh goodness they wrote something like that  I used to love npr  but they ve gone so far left over the last few years I just cant anymore. sad to hear they ve continued the trend.
@fuyu no kitsune  yes they sure did
@fuyu no kitsune  thats who npr has always been
@nevergonnna giveyouup  honestly I disagree with that  they were always left-leaning  yes  but for the most part brought in views from the right as well  which was why I liked them. they were fairly balanced all things considered until the trump era  and when I stopped entirely was when they started reporting legitimately false info on the minneapolis stuff.
@fuyu no kitsune  I think we largely agree in acknowledging they ve always been left leaning and dominated but where I diverge from you is in asserting they ve always been radicals  only recently having the mask come off and exposing themselves for who they truly are. having one centrist and one right leaning person sitting in a studio with a liberal  a progressive and a marxist is hardly a fair representation of the diversity of unique right wing politics and attitudes. it enables the radical lefts  shifting of the overton window to normalize more far left attitudes. thats my opinion. not trying to make you agree with me  just putting it out there. thanks for the thoughtful reply.
youre not alone  pal.
I never thought not seeing race would ever be considered racist  yet here we are.
same.  I got a t shirt with it on the front really big
the salt must flow!
Goddamn right

@nevergonnna giveyouup  reeeeeeeeeee!
didn t someone make that myth as a troll  and people actually took itseriously  and here we are. w t f
its impossible to do that
as a male sane o really hate seeing so many man be afraid to talk badly. I guess they just have brothers that help defend the sister as well. sigh
@dimitrI warchief  um what
excellent vod  mel! I ll use as many black person gifs as I want and will now use them more often just out of spite. Im guessing we cant say fruit punch on facebook and tiktok either
love your more interactive and entertaining format with your recent video s. thanks for interacting as much as you can with your fan. im not a hardcore one but I ll admit you cover topic-middle story-recap then interactive feedback... I have no idea if I got it correctly.
back in my day late 80s into the 90s we were told to not label people now its how many labels can we fit on one person.
paraphrasing vee  a romanian youtuber   for the woke mob the question isn t about if something is racist or not but how they can find racism in it .
racial issues feel more in your face now than it ever was back in the 80s and 90s. it feels like we were doing good and then after 9 11 we just started regressing more and more. I really hope to see a turning point back to where we should be going.
I will never not use the  I dont rap  gif. its legendary.
it always comes down to these people seeking out a dragon to slay... their lives are so void of actual purpose that they make it up.
at this point it almost feels like there s a random number generator creating things to be offended by.
this is in reference to alan sundqvist s highlighted comment about him leaving the star fanbase for halo only to be disappointed  its frustrating when franchises we love go woke  but thankfully we still have the excellent original games  movies  books  etc. also  if the current ip holders aren t going to do anything good with the characters and stories we love  that doesnt mean we cant have quality art and stories  we just have to make it ourselves!
this is why people shouldn t waste their brain cells on twitter and the more people that leave that garbage platform the better off humanity will be
watched the channel for the first time thinking I would like because of video game commentary  but loving because of the verse of the day. a surprise to be sure  but a welcome one
I kind of say this a lot whenever this kind of topic comes up  either with race or feminism where people are usually asking for privilege rather than rights  you are either my equal or you are my lesser and I dont care which one you want to be  but you cant be both.
they ve been complaining about  digital blackface  for years  and its never taken off.the bar is so low  that tanning is considered blackface.
yup they keep finding new ways to divide people based on surface traits like skin colour. we re all human and each one of us is unique. we should be finding things to bring us together  like cat videos.  -
based on the broken logic... does that mean that blind people cannot possibly be racists since they cannot see colour skin anyways   dave chappelle skit related
everyone needs to just use gifs of other races in good-spirited ways  and tell the self-appointed hairfire gatekeepers  the finger.
much respect for doing Bible content too. an influencer thats a good influence. who d have thunk it.
I will use rihanna gifs until I die and there s nothing they can do to stop me.
I need a gif of morpheus  with the screen text   what if I told you...its a hard  g  - its not a jiff
digital black face  has been a thing for years now.
I had no idea chappelle did a bit about that  Ive joked about how our understanding of race is ableist because it doesnt account for the lived experiences of blind people  checkmate normies.
first time Im hearing of it
@imperial vagabond  yeah  the bbc did an article on it in 2017.
who watches bbc
imaginary thing for years now
from my experience  girl gamers were treated like Goddesses in the old days of gaming from the arcade to early mmos like eq. I think it was probably mostly fps games were this game keeping crap was happening.
just wanted to say hi! I am not a Christian  but I enjoy your verse of the day. learning a word of God cannot be a bad thing in this world. keep up the great videos and go boom!
yet when its the other way around  fine. really starting to feel like its driven by bitterness and wanting to take  revenge
you are not allowed to be funny and irreverent to wiggle out of our poor haphazard accusations of inherent bigotry.  now sitstill and be a good stereotypical bogeyman for the cameras so we can punish you.
whew! Im lucky Im filipino. I can use any meme gif as a reaction.
man they really love taking the fun out of shit for bullshit reasons. also  you look amazing today
1 minute in and I gasped in spanish... melonie doesnt know schitt s creek ! loved thatshow
but if we all come together  how canthey feel special  wont someone think of the virtual signalers
if I could post gifs on yt I d be posting teal c all over the comments here. him saying  indeed  is my favorite gif ever  and I will die on that hill before I let anyone take that away from me.
im never gonna stop using the gif of the kid holding a cup and looking at the camera awkwardly. sna screw you yourube for not letting me post a link but allowing all these catfishing scammers to spam a videos comments with links to porn!
melonie mac needs you people to listen up and she needs you to listen twice because she s only going to tell you once.
ignore them and use them anyway. the only way forward is to trudge forever onward. never backing down and tearing your feet up from the muck to plant another step forward is the only way out of this swamp  or else you stand still and let itslowly sink and consume you.
these people will never be satisfied.  even in that thread  1 40  they cant even decide if its racist to do something or racist not to do it.
Lord  Imiss the 90 s...
im black and got two younger sisters who claim to be all about their skin color. and asked them why  we re all people  we live under the same sky just with different creeds and values. they both couldn t answer me but the funny thing about this is they both date whites dudes
hey melonie. if a white person used white gifs all the time  they d be then called a racist or a white supremacist for sure. hard to win in this crazy world. we are all just pieces of life. Jesus loves us all equally .
sunday funday macdrop!! love the gfuel tiktok!! I hope you make it through
Im still doing black face for halloween again
what a lot of people dont realize is that people wbo  dont see color  arent blinded by real racial discrimination. they still see the daily struggles endured. they just dont look at anybody differently
I identify as every gif I use.  muhahahaha
that was my planeveryone
the best reaction gifs are steve harvey reaction gifs. dont matter what color you are.
I have a friend  white  who dresses as the black ranger from mmpr every halloween because he loved zack s hip hop aikido style of fighting. he loved walter jones growing up. to think that these people  if back then existed  would tear away a role model away from a young boy or girl based simply off of the colour of their skin is pure racism. and I see no difference in the context with that twatter poster. and Imeant twat ter.
everytime you call me a boomer I get triggered  even though I know its because of your channel name haha  I also have no ill feeling toward boomers. this is something Imust work on .
those black brothers have the most expressive faces. its so full of life. very animated. they convey what I feel at the moment. only racist people stop using they facial meme.
it is like everytime tho. sometimes I see that is all what some people use  I dont even know what Im laughing at anymore.
and big facts gamestop like 7 years ago is how I first found you and have followed you since
speaking of black  its nice to see your nails with a new coat of paint.  you have very lovely hands!
and if youre a dog and you post kitty .gifs thats digital blankchase and will result in... permaban.
credibility of one-legged kick boxing teachers  these wokesters.
I actually thought you were referring to this old video from four years ago. the bbc put out a video saying why it was wrong to use digital blackface.how history repeats itself.  https   youtu.be cyq6ftyxztc
you are awesome.  amazing.  the bestest!!!!
hair color  superfluouseye color  superfluousskin color  superfluousheight  superfluouslife experience  strengthshared experience  strengthfaith  strengthc mon  y all! there is so much more to humanity than what meets the eye. learn about each individual. take the time to understand where each person is on their life s journey. be wise and listen more than you speak. impart wisdom when you have the opportunity.
gifs are useful  memeable    these people need to lighten up.
life is like clinging to a cliff. God is at the top throwing us a rope and trying to encourage us to climb up and be with him in heaven. as you said  even those who do not choose to accept his help can still hear him calling. but some people reject his help out of a vain belief that they dont need his help to climb up  or refuse to accept that he is calling to them at all. and  as you said  these people fall to the bottom of the cliff  where they can neither see nor hear God anymore. when this happens  I believe then they truly understand what it was like to have God with them their entire life  and that profound solitude is what makes hell as terrible as it is. because for the first time  you are truly suffering alone and without comfort.
just sent one last night. to a black person too. I think I ll do it again tomorrow.
everyone ought to be a former employee of gamestop at least once in their life. almost had the chance in the early 2000 s  but they looked at my resume  saw I graduated from college  and the manager just looked at me and said   dude  youre  over-qualified for this job. you should find better work somewhere else.  little would this guy know that I d wind up working retail anyways. but  thats a long story of voting obama  going through the great recession  having internal depression and family drama that ll take a lifetime to unpack. however  I do agree that God takes care of people. it may be hard to see his pressence in our lives  but he s there. sometimes its a question if we re willing to let him in to help.
hImelonie  you should look at the direct interpretation of what hell means in the Bible.  directly translated from hebrew the word hell means grave.  everyone has to be resurrected before they can go to heaven unless you are one of the 144 000 from the tribes of israel.  revelation talks about the 3 resurrections.  just wanted to mention this if you were interested.  keep up the great work!
under the sky  under the heavens  there is but one family.  - bruce leehe died a long time before I was born but that perfectly encapsulates how I was raised.
there s definitely racial differences biologically and in group average behaviors but thats ok and we dont need to hate each other because we aren t exactly the same and the world would be a very grey plain place if all humans where the same so I say its a good thing that different subspecies exist within species imagine if there was only one type of dog and cat and so on it would be boring.
I was raised in the military.... the only colors I was taught to recognize was green and blue.
us born in the 80s and 90s truly grew up in a post racial america and got to see it come back  cool
you should play hellblade senua s sacrifice
I ll one up you  nobody is the same. every person is different  even identical twins. looks shouldn t tell you much..
we are all sons of God  no matter your skin color  where you were born  what religion you follow  what preferences you have  he love us before and after anything
I got restricted on facebook for posting  mein kampfy chair  on a friends post. literally all it took.
the worst isn t people that have really bad takes. the worst is that there are so many people that actually go along with it. if youre avoiding using gifs because of the colour of the person s skin  youre a closet racist. its so sad that people like that get more validation than criticism.
referencing at 10 50  part of my favorite pericope in the Bible   for by him all things were created  in heaven and on earth  visible and invisible  whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities all things were created through him and for him. and he is before all things  and in him all things hold together.   col 1 16 17 - esv  God is everywhere and holds everything together.
everytime you post doge memes  thats digital dogface  you should all be ashamed of yourselfs  stick to your own!! mad.
the  story in the Bible youre probably thinking of melanie mac  for those that are interested  not that I wanna be preachy or anything  is the prisoner dimas who asked Jesus to remember him when  this was during Jesus  crucifiction  and Jesus responds    amen I say to you  you will be with me in paradise  I think that was luke ch. 23 whether this man barely knew of Jesus or not  he turned to Jesus while the others were looking for passerbys to be saved. I guess in that breif moment its absolutely possible to look for God  even in your darkest hour. even if you barely know of him  you just might meet him in paradise .
I was very confused by the title at first. what is gifs thought i...oh! she means gifs. I just found it amusing  not a critique
while a lot of tomb raider stuff is meh now. the music and sound design for tomb raider go is great for chilling   meditate   yoga ect...
hell is knowing God exists   loves us  but is disapointed in us.  feeling both God s love and disappoint for eternity.
I usually pick my first option but now Im gonna go out of my way to use a black person.
God s promise is true. it never affects us in the way we think  but it is always there.  you just have to put faith in him.
well it doesnt matter what skin color you are on the outside just think about the fact that we are all pink on the inside psycho stabby noises
it doesnt matter if jen taylor is voicing it  that  cortana  will never be her.the writing is 20yrs out of date   probably full of the woke.its gonna be a real shame that they wasted this opportunity to do a great halo story.
chihuahuas are not pitbulls. both are canis lupos familiaris. there are more genetic differences between two random chihuahuas than between the average chihuahua and the average pitbull.
after the genesis passage when you mentioned that hell will be separation from God. woeI hadn t considered that. that means no meditation prayer  healing talents  the holy spirit or any other gifts he gives us. hell means no contact with Jesusalso that gif concept is dumb. people just need to be cool
we re living in idioracy time friends
perhaps one of the verses you were looking for is matthew 5 45b  esv    for he  God  makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good  and sends rain on the just and on the unjust.  and I agree  hell is going to be the absence of God.ps   fruit punch   not only would you get struck for  punch   you d probably be labeled a homophobe on top of it.
it would dependon what you mean by protection.  in terms of salvation  only faith  repentence  and baptism saves your soul.  and this must be done at the age where you are self-determining  able to exercise freewill .  this is why children are exempt.  as for protection from earthly things  God has answered prayers and cries from the unbeliever in various points in the Bible.  but this is usually when someone is asking pleading for help.  God listens to his faithful before anyone else  as that is our privilege of being one of his children.  but I do believe he will demonstrate his mercy in the hopes that the person people will choose to foloow Christ.   stay blessed melonie!
Im albino. does that mean I can only react with gifs of albino people  what about people that are from different countries  is that  digital cultural appropriation  I reacted to that guy with snoop dogg saying  shut the fuck up
God s grace upon unbelievers is called common grace. he makes rain fall on all people both believers and unbelievers.
was doing dumbbell bench press this morning and dumbbell fell down and went boom!    on happier note I can now go up to my asian friend and go  why no asian
I used to read revelation and think  why does God have to destroy the whole earth like that  but when I see stuff like this nutty rampant wokeism  Im like  ahhh  I get it now.
so tired of mental gymnastics.  it feels like these stupid thoughts that we have but go  no  thats stupid.  and then there were those who didn t recognize how dumb is sounded and entertained it as valid and now we re are with rampant mental gymnastics. Im seriously worried about anyone s cognitive ability who sees reaction gifs as literally rather than conceptual.
social media should ve stopped at myspace  people going downhill fast with twitter
matthew 5 45 -- so that you may be sons of your father in heaven. for he causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good  and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.we are all God s creation  including those that do not believe.  our father in heaven definitely has mercy on those he chooses  and sets aside others accordingly.romans 9 15 -- for he tells moses  I will show mercy to whom I will show mercy  and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.
when culture is this corrupt most peoples  virtue is solely performative.
humanity is a race  the color of skin isn t a different race  we have different skin pigments divided according to our climates as in how much we get sunlight  so looking down on dogs and parasites  dogs are parasites and cats are the master race  is real racism  I dont know what we should call being mean to eachother by the means of making someone less of person by the pigment of their skin  but not racism. also Im not a vegan  all hail deer meat  but this is a fact.
everybody is born with the light of Christ. its your conscience  and you get it as a  free complimentary gift  merely for being born. its up to everyone how they want to use their free agency depending on their choices. if you dont feed that light you will lose it.
I use pepe gifs and hail kekistand  hahaha !
this triggered me    bloody hell this pissed me off so much. we have come so far to go down this awful hole  seriously man.
those kinds of people should absolutely be shamed. there is no coexisting with them. make them feel ashamed to be that idiotic.
fruit punch - that would be a double ban
I thought the bbc originally came up with this meme.
digital blackface  hahahahahahahahaha.
that uncle roger .gif is fuiyoh!!
this is insanity
remember the add for a nice hawaiian punch. lmao
Im always a gentleman and respectful about these issues.thats why I only do black face on the weekend
@michael quaid  lol
is thatsupposed to stop me because it wont from now on I ll only communicate with gifs
okay  use black reaction gif
they are not finding racism but they have found neurosis.
I thought this is why most emojis started out yellow...
sweet melonie your rocking out a greataddias tank top.keep marching to yourown marching lol semperfi.I treat everyone the way I wanted to be treated.jehova Jesus loves us all.your laughter is what I needed I hadrough day today.I think we re headinginto a real universe of demolition man lol.cat hair will find its way anywhere.takecare melonie
digital black face hahahahaha these people seriously need to get off the internet for a bit and get out in the real world between social media especially twitter and the echo chambers its breaking them breaking their minds where to point they think even posting something silly like this is a good idea. go to church  take a kid fishing  take a walk something get outside holy shit.
there are no girls on the internet  used to be a meme before memes were memes. is this hate speech now
wow this is just wow. the fact that black people myself included didn t even come up with this.
wasn t this the talking point back in 2016
pretty sure the original tweet was just a joke.
happy spring equinox!!!
came for pretty girl. stayed for interesting topics. good view points and Bible verses.
again  they keep trying to make  digital blackface  a thing like every year. its never going to become a thing.
this only makes their fight against racism a freaking mess.
dude is just crazy
didn t this sort of rhetoric pop up a year or two ago  this seems bizzaro world levels of familiar.
hI new viewer firstly good job  .  broadly speaking cultural appropriation does not take into account people s  believeing in past lives. I know your cristian btw and apparently the vatican has references from Bible about reincarnation which where removed. ergo how can u appropriate if u were that race and are drawn to it  we are one who has many faces.
also I have a wife and she doesnt like me playing online with girl gamers.
I think anyone that uses twitter is looking to be offended that really is the only purpose of twitter right
people will do anything for a bit of attention on the internet
gifs are too fun   useful for that to ever gain great traction despite what these karens are trying to push.
I see you are using a black background on your screen and you are also wearing a black shirt it would seem you are black facing all over the place
in the past we are called the human race
yoooo 1 4 black garrett Imiss him on crowder.
are they seriously bringing up this boogeyman again !
look for a different .gif  ain t nobody got time for that.
commenting to feed the algorithm
with every virtue signal  I pray for nuclear fire to purify us all.
I thought about this lol
its melonie!booooom baby!!!!!
wow  I truly thought you got tricked by a really good joke.. then I looked deeper.. and its not a joke.. this is sad.. it is truly truly sad..
Im a happy boomer.
are you wearing leiderhosen  or are you pants just extra shiny   lol
this dude is the whole circus.
yeah  this reminds me of sensitivity readers  the newest bane of the tabletop rpg and fantasy sci-fI fiction industry so much. if you are an individual who gets paid for sniffing out all kinds of -isms and -phobias  it is in your best interest to point them out 24 7. you thought badd  bothered about dungeons   dragons  was bad  you better buckle up  kiddo!
stop emojI hate    yellow emojis matter!
stick with your own race  is what they re saying  my  my. how the tables have turned.
race hustlers gonna hustle...water is wet.

love the adidas! and woke person offended by something  must be a day that ends with y.
Im annoyed there is no bows or spears in fallout 4 like Im supposed to believe some drugged out raider can make a makeshift .50 cal but not a sharp stick.
wasn t the issue with black face  is that it was taking a job or money from a black person   so these gifs are taking money out of a non-white gifs pocket or something  I think too many people still have lead water pipes in their house.
I cant stand people like this. I ll use the gif  pic  whatever I want. this is odd gatekeepig.
oh  ffs!
I dont want to have  conversation  with these jagoffs. just  dont care  know what they are and what they think  judging on color before character.Im good.
thanks for the video sis  but let me help you out on the gospel tip  this passage explains that the law of God is written in our hearts  our conscience also bearing witness even when we try to ignore the evil works we do  rather we are aware or not aware  or if we choose to do the good works that God made us for  romans 2 15 12for as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law  and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law  13 for not the hearers of the law are just before God  but the doers of the law shall be justified. 14for when the gentiles  which have not the law  do by nature the things contained in the law  these  having not the law  are a law unto themselves  15which shew the work of the law written in their hearts  their conscience also bearing witness  and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another   16in the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel. 17behold  thou art called a jew  and restest in the law  and makest thy boast of God  18and knowest his will  and approvest the things that are more excellent  being instructed out of the law
black  brown  white  red  green no matter what the color of our skin. we are all human beings.  except maybe the green one. lol
I joked around about how its racist to upload black and white photos because they re black and white ahahaha!
yea what the hell  these woke people are nuts  we re all human beings  the only reason we have different skin colors is because of the environments we originated from  thats it  it doesnt make us inferior or superior
Im casually waiting for toilets to be problematic coz there  white
aww  what a shame  look how much I care
its crazy that h3h3 basically made this same video 5 6 years ago but now ethan would side with this guy.such a disappointment...
boom boom
the demand for racism far outweighs the supply so people have to manufacture it to keep up with the demand.
what if you say  punch a nazI   I thought that was perfectly acceptable.
people call me a racist  I pretty much say  yeah  so    its lost its meaning. dont look to me to carry your water. just because I treat everyone like the assholes they are  dont get mad on my account. I pay my own bills  cut my own bread. if you aren t my priority  tough. get over it.Ive got real issues  like paying bills and making bank to worry about nonsense like this.
where s a massive planet obliterating asteroid when ya  need one
look up apophis. 2029. we have seven years.
@dying rose
you dont have to believe in God for God to believe in you.
I remember when slate did an article about gif  black face  in 2017   and they got dragged for it. this white knight didn t get the message apparently.
imagine thinking that its a priority to police others  use of gifs when there are idiots out there using the words  irregardless    impactful   and  malus  without being punished as they deserve. fix the real problem first!
.... oh yeah and . I look like not a one  and Im using all of them  allfacesareforme
who care anyway  I use what I want regardless if ppl get offended or not including box braids
this is old news. the bbc made a whole ass video trying to explain this shit over 4 years ago.
bruh this shits still a thing I thought this bs died ages ago
anybody who thinks digital blackface is racist  probably shouldn t play a bethesda game  blackface bug is rampant in them .in the real world  skin colour doesnt matter. only words and actions matter.
race grifters and trollers. ignore em.
Im getting sick and tried people are bashing the word racist and racism toward everything and everyone. its almost like both words lost their meaning of the word because of people who want to be triggered by stuff.
lol yet they love the lispy trudeau  who actually wore real black face. bravo give yourselves a pat on the back
cortana looks how the scientist is supposed to look not cortana. cortana should should look like a young early 20 s alyssa milaono or evangeline lilly not a middle aged woman
the irony is so funny  race hustlers need to be stopped
.... when the demand for racism outweighs the actual supply....the woke never fails to depress. impress  no  depress.
I dont see the difference in races we are all humans. and I refuse to judge others by race and I dont care what that makes me in the eyes of the woke.
like a very exaggerated hatred of satire or any type of escapism instead of any actual racism  current times suck
wat
why couldn t the 2012 apocalypse theory be correct  spare us this nonsense.
this dude is a clown.  personally  I feel itshouldn t matter what race the person in the gif is if it fits the point youre trying to make.
you can only use gifs of people lower than you on the progressive stack  duh.
